### Another Dynastic Crisis
 - Coins show Valentinian and Valens together sharing power
	 - Hold together the orb, a symbol of power
	 - Child emperors
 - No direct link to Constantine's bloodline

**Rebellion** 356-366:
 - Huge number of successors rise up, some examples:
 - Jovian: Supported as emperor
 - Procopius: Comes from Constantinople, essentially on family line of Julian (not Constantine)
	 - Manages to find support, not only from Rome, but military support from Gaul tribes
 - Some pagan aristocrats trying to exploit new power from Julian to get a new pagan emperor

**Age of Children Emperors**:
 - Valentinian I has a very strong personality
	 - Much like Julian, we have multiple sources to learn about this period
	 - Valens in the East, Valentinian in the West
 - There were technically two emperors, Valentinian took the lead on anything important
	 - Only one emperor in practice
 - Goes to Italy and promotes his own son, Gratian, to the role of Augustus
	 - Some coins showing Valentinian and Gratian (smaller child) sharing the orb

### Military Issues
 - Valens and more friendly relationships with the Sassanians
	 - Case of Armenia and King Shapur III
 - Armenia: Population was very mixed, people siding with either Persian or Roman empires
 - King Shapur III separated into two regions of influence
 - Allowed Christians to freely stay in his territory

**Rhine/Danube Frontier**:
 - Started as a peaceful frontier
 - Invading Huns put huge pressure on the Goths, who try to move into the Roman empire
 - Valentinian I realizes that fighting these people has lead to nothing, started a huge diplomatic process that was very successful
 - Ritualized Diplomacy: *Foedus* (type of treaty), Romans create this treaty that treats the others as equals
	 - Mostly just for show as part of a diplomatic ritual (Rome is still Rome)
	 - Establishes that Rome and others will not wage war with each other, and provide equal support to each other
		 - Very positively seen by the other barbarian people
	 - Valens allows the barbarians within the Roman borders, bad idea
 - Begin to put levies on the barbarians to help establish the borders
	 - Join the Roman army to help defeat the ones that pressure Rome
 - Valentinian I starts spending a huge amount of money (that they don't have) to construct and refurbish forts and watch posts
	 - All along the northern border
 - 375: Valentinian I died of a fit of apoplectic anger and seizure (Ammianus Marcellinus)
	 - Two groups of people came to him to say that Roman treatment of their groups after the treaty was unlawful
	 - Valentinian I was so angry about this that he had a seizure and died
 - Generalissimo called Justinia (Valentinian's Wife) and made Valentinian II the Augustus
	 - He was 4 years old, Gratian is 16 at this time (need to be 18 to be grown man)
	 - Justinia and the Generals (old aristocracy) has the real power in this moment as the two Augusti in the West are children
		 - Resurgence in oligarchic groups of the aristocracy to run the western empire

**Valens Versus the Goths**;
 - Two consequences: Settlement of Goths within Roman borders, a terrible military defeat
 - Valens decides to wage war against the Goth groups that were pressuring him
	 - Travelled from Constantinople to Adrianople
 - "Worst Roman defeat since Cannae" (Hannibal) - Ammianus Marcellinus
	 - Battle of Adrianople
	 - Valens and 10000 men died, the emperor's body was never recovered
 - Future emperors will have to fight the Goths within Roman borders
	 - After this defeat, Emperors will never personally engage enemies beyond borders of Rome

**Theodosius I** (379):
 - Two kids in the West, Valens killed in the East
 - Theodosius I is brought from forced retirement to become head of the Roman Empire
	 - Official appointment is months later, traveling to the East, Gratian gives him power
 - Came from a military family, his father and himself were very important generals
	 - Had huge support from the army
 - Is not interested in fighting with the kids in the West
 - Raises another man to power, Magnus Maximus, another soldier of the army
	 - Decided to march towards Italy to get approval from Valentinian II & Gratian as Augustus
 - Empress Justinia was Christian (not orthodox Christian, Aryan Christian, Aryanism)
	 - Put forth an edict of toleration towards Aryan Christians using her son's power
 - Lots of political infighting, usurper Ambrose (?), orthodox Christian fighting other orthodox Christians
	 - Justinia says her family will revert to Orthodoxy and will give her own daughter to Theodosius for help to fight the usurper
 - Marriage union between two bloodlines, emperors of the East and the West
	 - Leaves two sons of previous marriage to go to Italy to become full Augustus, fight usurper
	 - Gratian died fighting with the usurper
	 - Valentinian II didn't matter to him, sent to one imperial city under army and generals
		 - Eventually kills himself some years later
