### Third-Century Crisis: Introduction
 - Years between the assassination of Severus Alexander (235) and the acclamation of Diocletian (284) are often referred to as the 3rd-century crisis

**Issues during this period**:
 - *Resistance to innovation and change*: The myth of "Roma Aeterna" and the "Invictus" emperors
	 - "Emperors" who tried to take power with the army
		 - Most assassinated or killed by fighting each other
	 - Persecutions
 - *Depopulation*: 20 years of plague in Italy and big cities elsewhere
	 - Five thousand deaths a day in Rome in 262
	 - 2/3rds of the population of Alexandria died
 - *The debasement of Roman coinage*: Rapid inflation crashing the economy
	 - 1 modius (8.61 l.) of wheat cost 2 sesterces in 150, by 300 the price was 400 sesterces
	 - The empire particularly needed to be able to pay to maintain the army
	 - Previously, the most important coin was made of silver. Over time, less silver was used, eventually a bronze coin covered in silver
 - *Succession of emperors*: Romans never figured out a good way to handle succession
	 - Augustus tried to make it about bloodline, didn't work particularly well
	 - Soldier emperors, they take the throne, no more bloodline to figure out actual succession
	 - Acclamation (public ritual expression of approval for the emperors) & absolute power
		 - Emperors still require support of the army, or senate, or people
		 - Portraying themselves as undefeatable, Rome can never be defeated
 - *Issues in Northern and Eastern borders*
	 - Difficult to maintain a huge amount of borders in the empire

**The Northern Border**:
 - Over the 3rd century, the Rhine and Danube were crossed repeatedly by Germanic people
	 - Franks, Alamanni, Juthungi, Vandals, Sarmatians
 - Franks and Saxons crossed the English Channel, fighting with the Romans there
 - Middle-Danubian provinces
	 - Noricum, Upper/Lower Pannonia, Dacia, Upper/Lower Moesia -> Illyricum
 - Goths often attacked Lower Danube
 - Rome often have to move troops to the east to fight the Persians
	 - Also reduced their forces for political infighting and civil war

**The Eastern Border**: 
 - In Persia, the Sasanian dynasty took over the Parthians in the 220s
 - King Shapur 1 (242-272) reached Antioch in Syria
	 - 261, captured Valerian

**Strategies**:
 - To settle "dediticii" (enemies who had surrendered to Rome) in frontier areas
 - Shift to a two-fold defensive system (Gallienus 253-268 - Valerian's son):
	 - Mobile field army (usually on horseback)
	 - Stationary frontier force

**Lucius Domitius Arelianus** (270-275)
 - Emperor Aurelian
 - Coinage reform: a disaster which led to higher inflation
	 - Changed composition of the gold coin, added more precious materials
	 - Attempted to show the empire was strong with expensive currency
 - Restructured the borders of Rome
	 - Important moment for the Romans
	 - Re-established frontiers, getting closer to Rome
 - Constructed Aurelian Walls in Rome as a precaution
	 - Coins say everything is okay and the empire is undefeated
	 - Still have to construct big ass walls after centuries of safety because all of a sudden it is in danger
 - Completed 3 very successful campaigns
