### Third Century Crisis
 - Years between assassination of Severus Alexander (235) and acclamation of Diocletian (284)
 - *Roma Aeterna* and the *Invictus* Emperors
	 - Emperors who attempted to seize power with the army, most assassinated or killed in civil war
 - *Depopulation*: 20 years of plague in Italy and other population centers
 - *Debasement of Coinage*: Rapid inflation, still needed to be able to pay military wages
	 - Changed amount of precious metals used in each coin
 - *Imperial Succession*: Augustus tried to make it about bloodline, failed. Soldier emperors w/ civil war
	 - Acclamation: Public ritual expression of approval for the emperor, absolute power
 - *Issues in Northern and Eastern Borders*: Difficult to maintain huge number of borders
	 - Shifted to 2-fold defensive system: Mobile field army (usually horseback), stationary frontier force

**Northern Border**: Rhine and Danube crossed repeatedly by Germanic people
 - Franks, Alamanni, Juthungi, Vandals, Sarmatians
 - Goths often attacked Lower Danube, Franks & Saxons fought the Romans across the English Channel
 - Rome also had to move troops to the East to fight the Persians, reducing forces for civil war

**Eastern Border**: Persia, Sassanian Dynasty took over the Parthians in 220s
 - King Shapur 1 reached Antioch in Syria, soon after captured Valerian

### Lucius Domitius Aurelianus - Emperor Aurelian
 - *Coinage Reform*: Added more precious metals to show the empire was strong w/ expensive money
	 - Disaster leading to higher inflation, new coins now worth more, had to collect old coins to smelt them down and recast new ones
 - *Restructured Borders of Rome*: Reduced the size of the Roman empire, easier to protect
	 - Re-established frontier borders, shrinking the empire closer to Rome
 - *Aurelian Walls of Rome*: Dichotomy with new coins, coins say Rome is strong, wall says Rome is scared
 - Completed 3 very successful military campaigns to regain the glory of Rome
 - City of Rome is losing relevance, power spread around empire, Emperor and court moving around

**Eastern Empire of Palmyra**: Under Zenobia Queen of Palmyra
 - Wanted to guarantee power for son under Roman empire, eventually just claimed power, minted coins of herself
 - When son came of age, became adversary of Aurelian to keep his mother in power
 - Eventually crushed and reintegrated into Roman civilization, big military accomplishment
	 - Meant to bring out son and mother to publicly execute them, killed en route

**Gallic Empire**: Separatists of Rome in the West
 - Wanted to recreate the empire and essentially rebuild Rome
 - Pacified and reintegrated into Rome when Aurelian defeated Tetricus

**Death**: Murdered in 275 when preparing a campaign against the Persian Empire
 - His military campaigns became so large that his people feared for their lives
 - Later Emperors:
	 - Marcus Claudius Tacitus: Persecutions of Aurelian's assassins
	 - Marcus Aurelius Probus: Acclaimed by the Syrian army
	 - M. Aurelius Numerius Carus: Shared power with two sons Carinus (West), Numerianus (East)
	 - Diocletian: Took power after death of Numerianus, fought against Carinus -> murdered after claim of sleeping with the wives of his commanders

### Diocletian and the Tetrarchy
 - Son of freedman from Dalmatia, made his name with military service
 - Appointed Maximian as a caesar, both equal in ranks (Augustus)
 - Minted coins with themselves on one side and the two most important deities on the other
 - Started the Tetrarchy: Division of the empire into West and East, and then into two smaller parts
	 - Two Augusti (Diocletian and Maximian) and two Caesars (Galerius and Constantius)
	 - West: Maximian & Constantius, East: Diocletian & Galerius
 - Legion was difficult to manage, began leaving parts of the army in different territories
	 - Managed by governors, managed by the Tetrarchy
	 - Governors were originally warlords of Augustus, eventually took on more responsibility & power
 - Division between military and politics was very blurred, Diocletian broke up
	 - *Praesides*: Governors of a province without military power, oversee *Duces & Comites*
		 - *Duces & Comites*: Military control of province for emergencies (not the whole army)
	 - *Vicarii*: Appointed by emperor to oversee *dioceses* (groups of provinces)
	 - *Prefects*: Military role, previously had to oversee all governors of all provinces, now only deal with administration of the army and imperial court.
 - *Tetrarchy Statue*: Symbolize one united empire, not individuals, not designed after real people
	 - Augusti are the ones with the arms on the Caesars, demonstrating they have more power

 - *Principate to the Dominate*: Move to new form of government
	 - Emperor is officially a *dominus*, not a *princeps* (military leader)
	 - *Primus*: *Inter Pares*, first among equals, propaganda to look like emperor is actually working with the senate, not absolute power

### Constantine
 - Dissolution of the Tetrarchy and Fights: Diocletian retires, forces Maximian to do the same
	 - Two Caesars become Augusti, new Caesars are nominated (Maximin Daia: East, Severus: West)
	 - Overlooked Maxentius (Maximian's son) and Constantine (Constantius' son)
 - When Constantine's father died he is named Caesar
	 - Battle of the Milvian Bridge against Maxentius, battle had reached Rome, dream of the Chi Rho
 - Arch of Constantine: Possibly to memorialize Milvian Bridge, or just taken by Constantine after battle
	 - Arch constructed using many parts of previous structures. Not enough money? Bad craftsmen?
	 - Scenes of Constantine giving public speech, only one sitting, propaganda of strong empire
 - Colossus of Constantine: Positioned in a way to always look at you regardless of where you are
	 - Exaggerated features, gigantic eyes, emperor is huge and watching everyone

 - Sol Invictus (Unconquered Sun): Use of Sol's image (solar monotheism) was stressed on the coinage
	 - Less offensive than traditional pagan pantheon to Christians

		 - Copies Sol's characteristic gesture of benediction
 - Heavenward Gaze: Coins with a bust with their eyes to heaven, supposedly devout prayerful aspect
	 - Already seen in Roman coins, derived from Hellenistic portraits of Alexander the Great
 - Explicitly Christian iconography had yet to be developed by end of Constantine's reign

**Constantinople**:
 - New Rome, named after Constantine. Left Rome, constantly visited Byzantium
	 - Renewed first wall of Byzas, extended and joined the two, renamed city Constantinople
 - Hippodrome, Palace, Forum: Adorned with bronze and riches, made similar to ones in Rome
 - Monumental city with all aspects connected to power and propaganda, trying to rebuild idea of Rome

### Christianity & Paganism
 - *St. Peter's Basilica, Rome*: Space for Christians, people built tombs and entire necropolis below it
	 - Only tomb that has been excavated is that of Peter (controversial)
 - *Church of Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem*: Not limited to only building religious structure in Rome
	 - Wants to construct a Christian center of worship, destroys some older temples (Aphrodite)

 - *Pagans*: Becoming a minority, cult permitted in private and later forbidden
 - *Manicheans*: Secretistic religion by prophet Mani (3rd century), sacred books
	 - Spread from Persia (East) all through the Empire and China
	 - Eventually became persecuted, particularly in Rome because it was converting Christians
 - *Christians*: Mostly in the East and in main cities such as Carthage and Rome, spoke Greek
	 - Certain larger houses converted into churches (along with new spaces)

**Christianity**:
 - *Seutonius* and *Tacitus* have accounts of Jesus being active during Emperor Tiberius
 - Christians differed from Jews (universal message, savior on Earth, resurrection)
	 - Romans thought them as another sect of Judaism
 - Christianity and Relationship with Roman Empire:
	 - First time idea of separating religious sphere from political authority
	 - People are subject to governing authorities, easiest way to distinguish Christians is refusal to perform ritual sacrifice to the emperor
 - Kingdom-Laws-King (Heaven vs Earth), Brother-Sister (incest), Eucharistic Rituals (cannibalism)
 - *Pliny's Epistle to Trajan*: Charging people accused of being Christians (libel)
	 - Discovered they weren't doing evil things besides having weird religion
	 - Realizes Christianity is spreading incredibly quickly (spread like contagion)
 - *Trajan's Epistle to Pliny*: Don't seek out Christians, if accused and convicted then punish them
	 - Libel claims must have an author
	 - Those that deny being a Christian must prove it by supplicating the gods

**Christian Persecutions**:
 - Before 3rd century, persecutions were occasional. Didn't perform sacred state rituals (*sacra-mores*)
	 - Threatening for state that considered religion on public, communal, political level
	 - Domitian accuses them of being atheists as they don't sacrifice to their god
 - Attractive, no restriction due to legal, social, political status. Women were welcomed, took active roles
 - Martyrs become heroes by refusing to deny their faith. Martyr=Witness (witness their fate)

**Passion of Perpetua and Felicity**:
 - *Trial*: Confessed to being Christian despite her father trying to stop her (abnormal in Rome)
	 - Hilarian passed sentence to condemn them to the beasts, cheerfully go to the prison
 - *Dream*: Dreams that she turns into a man and crushes an Egyptian head and is rewarded by god

	 - Sad that she won't die with her friends, they are sad because they don't want to leave her behind
	 - Pray to god 3 days before the games, after their prayer she gives birth to a daughter

**Church Hierarchies**:
 - Orthodoxy (Correct/righteous opinion) vs Heresy (hairesis - chosen thing/choice)
	 - Christianity is history of heresies, definite doctrine = differing opinions and quarrels
 - Male celibate leadership: Separate from regular Roman family-centric society
	 - Very stratified Roman household, father has power of life or death, house is most important
	 - Ties to community instead of ties to family
 - Administration: Ekklesia (Assembly) > Episkopos (Overseer) > Presbuteros (Elder) > Diakonos (Server)
 - Most important centers for the church: Rome, Carthage, Alexandria, Antioch, Constantinople
