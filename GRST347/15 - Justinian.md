### Internal and Religious Politics
 - Emperor Anastasius I: (491-518 CE)
	 - Already 60 years old when he gained power
		 - Wanted to make succession as easy as possible, comes with issues
		 - Lots of issues surrounding war with his reign
	 - Isaurian War: Started almost immediately after he gained power
		 - Previous emperor came from a region in Isauria
 - Balkans: Barbarians keep coming from here
 - Persians: Kavadh I and an open conflict after a century of peace
	 - Location: Armenia
	 - Kavadh was very interested in this region, years of war that end with a treaty that leaves everything untouched
 - Italy: Fight against Theodoric
	 - Italy is no longer part of the empire
	 - Taxes were not paid, men could not be raised
		 - Taxes that were paid were collected by the Ostrogoths, never made it to the Empire
		 - No more Roman army in the west, only the Ostrogoth army
		 - Subject kingdoms turned out to be a bad idea
	 - Justinian in the East started a war
 - More religious issues

**Procopius**:
 - Likely born sometime between 490-507 CE in Caesarea, Palestine
 - Received a strong education, lawyer for a time
 - Also part of Belisarius' retinue for several of Justinian's campaigns
	 - Likely had first-hand experience/information
	 - Serious questions of bias
	 - Talks about Belisarius' and the other administrators of Justinian's wars as tyrants
		 - Was not supposed to be published
		 - Claims Justinian was a tyrant, the actual emperor was wife Theodora
 - His works (Wars, Buildings, and Secret History) provide much of what we know of 6th century
	 - Great source for historical analysis of Justinian

**Justin** (518-527 CE):
 - A complex rise to the throne
	 - The aristocrats had a tremendous amount of power, would fight to rule at any opportunity
 - Aggressive pro-Chalcedonianism
	 - Started to take all of the other bishops and replaced them with Chalcedonian bishops
	 - Resolution of the Acacian Schism between East and West
 - Initial good relationship with the Ostrogoth Theoderic
	 - Theoderic tried to nominate his own son as successor, Justin did not want that
 - War broke out with Persia right at the end of his mandate
	 - Huge campaign just started against Persia, the emperor dies and Justinian has to take over
		 - Justinian has no war experience, unlike Justin

**Justinian I** (527-565 CE):
 - Nephew, later adopted son of Justin I
	 - Appointed as co-emperor in the last year of life of Justin
	 - Both ways to smooth succession and guarantee Justinian's rule
 - The longest-reigning emperor since Augustus
 - Major societal changes
	 - Greatest accomplishment is the Corpus Juris Civilis (Code of Justinian)

**Theodora: Problematic Empress**:
 - Not from a high-class family
	 - Father and step-father were bear keepers for the circus factions
	 - Procopius says she had been a performer, possibly a prostitute (2.3.9, Theodora on Stage)
 - Justinian took notice of her and she went on to become empress

**The Nika Riot** (532):
 - "Circus" factions: Blues and Greens
	 - Justinian and Theodora were supporters of the Blues
	 - Other factions: Reds and Whites
 - Riots start at the Hippodrome, fight between the circus factions, murder accusations
	 - Accused find refuge in a monastery, cannot be arrested from there, basically imprisoned in monastery, as soon as they leave they will be grabbed and sentenced to death
	 - Both factions ask Justinian to free the accused (one green and one blue)
		 - Justinian refuses, tried to be peaceful, explodes into a huge riot (several days)
		 - Eventually tried to appoint a new emperor, Justinian had to call the army
 - Procopius recalls Theodora's significant role in keeping Justinian in power
	 - She is the one who tells Justinian to not flee the city (other councilors tell him to flee)
	 - She knows that is the worst thing they could do for the situation, people needed to see them in person helping out
 - Half the city burnt to the ground
	 - Hippodrome completely destroyed
	 - The army came in and had to kill 30k people to quell the riots
		 - 5-10% of the entire population of Constantinople
		 - Two other riots during Justinian's reign, in those cases he immediately stops them
	 - From a disaster, to a great opportunity
