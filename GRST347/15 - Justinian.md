### Internal and Religious Politics
 - Emperor Anastasius I: (491-518 CE)
	 - Already 60 years old when he gained power
		 - Wanted to make succession as easy as possible, comes with issues
		 - Lots of issues surrounding war with his reign
	 - Isaurian War: Started almost immediately after he gained power
		 - Previous emperor came from a region in Isauria
 - Balkans: Barbarians keep coming from here
 - Persians: Kavadh I and an open conflict after a century of peace
	 - Location: Armenia
	 - Kavadh was very interested in this region, years of war that end with a treaty that leaves everything untouched
 - Italy: Fight against Theodoric
	 - Italy is no longer part of the empire
	 - Taxes were not paid, men could not be raised
		 - Taxes that were paid were collected by the Ostrogoths, never made it to the Empire
		 - No more Roman army in the west, only the Ostrogoth army
		 - Subject kingdoms turned out to be a bad idea
	 - Justinian in the East started a war
 - More religious issues

**Procopius**:
 - Likely born sometime between 490-507 CE in Caesarea, Palestine
 - Received a strong education, lawyer for a time
 - Also part of Belisarius' retinue for several of Justinian's campaigns
	 - Likely had first-hand experience/information
	 - Serious questions of bias
	 - Talks about Belisarius' and the other administrators of Justinian's wars as tyrants
		 - Was not supposed to be published
		 - Claims Justinian was a tyrant, the actual emperor was wife Theodora
 - His works (Wars, Buildings, and Secret History) provide much of what we know of 6th century
	 - Great source for historical analysis of Justinian

### Justinian
**Justin** (518-527 CE):
 - A complex rise to the throne
	 - The aristocrats had a tremendous amount of power, would fight to rule at any opportunity
 - Aggressive pro-Chalcedonianism
	 - Started to take all of the other bishops and replaced them with Chalcedonian bishops
	 - Resolution of the Acacian Schism between East and West
 - Initial good relationship with the Ostrogoth Theoderic
	 - Theoderic tried to nominate his own son as successor, Justin did not want that
 - War broke out with Persia right at the end of his mandate
	 - Huge campaign just started against Persia, the emperor dies and Justinian has to take over
		 - Justinian has no war experience, unlike Justin

**Justinian I** (527-565 CE):
 - Nephew, later adopted son of Justin I
	 - Appointed as co-emperor in the last year of life of Justin
	 - Both ways to smooth succession and guarantee Justinian's rule
 - The longest-reigning emperor since Augustus
 - Major societal changes
	 - Greatest accomplishment is the Corpus Juris Civilis (Code of Justinian)
 - Over time, is able to reconquer much of the old Roman Empire, retakes Africa and Italy

**Theodora: Problematic Empress**:
 - Not from a high-class family
	 - Father and step-father were bear keepers for the circus factions
	 - Procopius says she had been a performer, possibly a prostitute (2.3.9, Theodora on Stage)
 - Justinian took notice of her and she went on to become empress

**The Nika Riot** (532):
 - "Circus" factions: Blues and Greens
	 - Justinian and Theodora were supporters of the Blues
	 - Other factions: Reds and Whites
 - Riots start at the Hippodrome, fight between the circus factions, murder accusations
	 - Accused find refuge in a monastery, cannot be arrested from there, basically imprisoned in monastery, as soon as they leave they will be grabbed and sentenced to death
	 - Both factions ask Justinian to free the accused (one green and one blue)
		 - Justinian refuses, tried to be peaceful, explodes into a huge riot (several days)
		 - Eventually tried to appoint a new emperor, Justinian had to call the army
 - Procopius recalls Theodora's significant role in keeping Justinian in power
	 - She is the one who tells Justinian to not flee the city (other councilors tell him to flee)
	 - She knows that is the worst thing they could do for the situation, people needed to see them in person helping out
 - Half the city burnt to the ground
	 - Hippodrome completely destroyed
	 - The army came in and had to kill 30k people to quell the riots
		 - 5-10% of the entire population of Constantinople
		 - Two other riots during Justinian's reign, in those cases he immediately stops them
	 - From a disaster, to a great opportunity

**Hagia Sophia**:
 - Took the opportunity of having the city burnt down to construct new religious monuments
 - Sourcebook: 2.7.3: Justinian's Saint Sophia, a temple to rival Solomon's
 - "... Rising above this circle is an enormous spherical dome which makes the building exceptionally beautiful. It seems not to be founded on solid masonry, but to be suspended from heaven by that golden chain and so covers the space ..."

**Justinian I and Christianity**:
 - Continuation of Justin's Chalcedonian politics
 - Theodora was a monophysite, actively protected them
 - In time, Justinian seemed to have moved towards his wife's position
	 - Bishops will condemn him for that
	 - Supports Christians vs Arians, lots of intermarriage between the two
	 - This wasn't an issue until he became Chalcedonian, now they hate him for changing

**Belisarius and Antonina**:
 - Justinian's most reliable and successful general
	 - By the end, the two were not seeing eye to eye
	 - Justinian jealous of the accomplishments of Belisarius
 - Antonina: Wife of Belisarius, very important aristocrat, did jobs in the court while Belisarius was outside of Constantinople
	 - Women gaining more rights
	 - Both are depicted in biblical mosaics in Ravenna
 - Have a lot of details about Belisarius' campaigns
	 - Procopius was following the army at this time

**Africa** (530-535):
 - Active declaration of war against the Vandal Kings of Africa
 - Hilderic had friendly relationship with Constantinople
	 - Hilderic knew he was getting old, became friendly with Constantinople
	 - Usurper Gelimer took the throne, Vandal infighting
 - Hilderic was able to ask for help from Justinian, Justinian provided help
	 - Procopius highlights the internal opposition to his campaign
	 - This does not matter to the empire, is an external conflict, different than how the empire has ever functioned
 - First Phase: Belisarius general, 10k infantrymen: Primary victory in 524
	 - Lots of infighting in Northern Africa between races and religion (Arians vs Catholics)
	 - Weakened the situation, allowed the Eastern empire to conquer Africa
 - Second Phase: General Solomon fighting against the Moors (Berbers) and indigenous people
	 - New General, Solomon, no longer fighting against the Vandals but against the Moors
	 - Last signs of resistance after the Vandals have been defeated
 - Both Belisarius and Gelimer forced to make signs of obedience to Justinian in the Hippodrome
	 - Problematic relationship between Belisarius and Justinian
	 - Justinian makes sure to make every victory about him, not Belisarius
 - Justinian sends Belisarius out on campaign again, prevents him from starting to seize power
 - Nobody thought they would win Africa, they thought they would just re-establish a friendly king
	 - Winning Africa made Justinian egotistical, thought he could fix another major problem

### Ostrogoths in Italy: Theoderic the Great
**Theoderic the Amal**:
 - Got into Italy: Emperor Zeno called him for help, gave him the role for getting rid of the Goths
	 - At this point, no real interest of the emperors to invade Italy
	 - Not a lot of resources for the Roman army, gave that task to Theoderic to defeat Odoacer
	 - Theoderic Goths had colonized all of Italy, even conquered Sicily (south island)
		 - Barbarians: Destroy everything, not actually that accurate
		 - Goths: "The glory of the Goths is to be guardians of civilization"
 - Theoderic was politically smart, was virtually a double agent
	 - Had received education, was trusted by the Romans
		 - Zeno had given Theoderic many titles (476: "son in arms")
	 - Anastasius I (497) sent *ornamenta palatii*: Sign of regal, not imperial rank
		 - Subject to the Roman  Emperor
	 - Theoderic was always very careful in not making any claim to imperial power
		 - He adopted rex-king; dominus-lord
		 - Extremely appreciative of the Roman Bureaucracy, flattered them
		 - Integration of Roman Laws into his new territory
 - He brought 10k Goths into Italy and conquered everything
	 - Settled mainly in the Po Valley, Adriatic Coast, and South of Naples and Sicily
 - Source 13.1.11, page 354: is Theoderic Emperor or King?
	 - Emperor in practice, started telling people that he is the ruler
	 - Took on the Emperor role and established Roman-like politics
 - Began building monumental architecture that connects Theoderic with Power
	 - Huge palace in Ravenna, will become fundamental for court-life
	 - Mosaic depictions of his palace in the chapels he is building
	 - Huge mausoleum, no decorations compared to the huge mosaics of Roman mausoleums
		 - Top level has a massive sarcophagus of precious material for Theoderic

**Amal Family, Gothic Heritage**:
 - Two exceptional narrators of this time: Cassiodorus and Jordanes
 - Neither Theoderic nor his successors issued a code of laws in their own names, as other German kingdoms did in the 5th century
	 - Worked within the Roman framework of government, using Roman officials
		 - Complete integration of Roman government
	 - Makes him very successful, no real opposition to his changes
 - Merging the societies of the Ostrogoths and the Roman Empire
	 - Ostrogoth jewelry and material culture
 - After death of Theoderic, great instability
	 - Amalasuntha (Sister of Theoderic) + Athalaric (Her son, child) (526-534)
	 - Strong infighting, both Amalasuntha and Athalaric die in 534
	 - Theodahad (534-536), a Hun, older nephew of Theoderic
		 - Raped and forced Amalasuntha to marry him to give him a blood tie
 - Both of these leaders asked the Roman emperor to help them on internal matter

### Justinian's Invasion of Italy, the Gothic War (535-554)
 - Reasons for attacking:
	 - Boost in confidence, they took Africa accidentally, might as well retake Italy too
	 - Religious concerns (Goths were Arians, problem for Justinian's Catholic hierarchy)
 - Arrival of the imperial army was the reason of the fall of the Amal family
	 - Crumbled fell rather easily, Vitigis -> Totilus (warrior Ostrogoths that took over)
		 - Totilus pushed back to southern Italy before being eliminated entirely
 - Belisarius reconquered Ravenna in 540 (five years to regain northern territory)
 - Outbreak of plague in 542 over the entirety of the empire

**Famine and Epidemics in the 6th and 7th century: Trends and Interpretations**:
 - *Late Antique Little Ice Age*: 2-3 eruptions (540-547) helped render the 540s the coldest decade in more than 2300 years
	 - Average temperature of about 11.8 celsius
	 - Described as the sun not being as strong as before
 - *Plague*: 1st wave in 541-549 CE
	 - Bubonic Plague, becomes endemic with worsening reoccurrences
		 - 18 reoccurrences in the Eastern Roman Empire during the next century
	 - All of the kids born during plague will become weak to the next one
		 - Survivors of the first one will have stronger immune system, but the kids will not
	 - Economy had crashed during the plague, Italy described as a wasteland
	 - Plague conditions made warfare difficult

**Justinian: Changed Man**
 - Got the plague, but survived
 - Became greatly concerned by religious matters
	 - Almost not interested in administrative issues
 - Ostentatious piety: Moves away from living in the palace
	 - Finds refuge in monasteries
 - *Rathumia*: Lassitude in external politics
	 - One of the major accusations against Justinian is that he turned from a very vicious emperor with strong foreign policies/warfare into someone who doesn't care anymore
 - Procopius: Some people thought Justinian was not real anymore, some spirit
	 - Justinian would randomly rise from the throne and start wandering, his head would disappear and the person watching would be distressed
	 - When the head returned to the body, his face would become featureless flesh
	 - Eventually his face would return
	 - This began to circulate, people thought the emperor was a ghost/demon
 - Respect and trust rapidly being lost in the emperor

**Military Campaigns in the West Post-Plague**:
 - Northern Africa (543-549): Defections and continued fights
	 - Also a wasteland due to the plague and famine
	 - After initial successes, the Roman's didn't actually get much from Africa
	 - Prolonged occupation was not well administrated, infighting and rebel groups
 - The Gothic War in Italy (543-552): Totila against the Roman Empire
	 - Ostrogoths tried to maintain southern Italy and Sicily, helped by the locals
	 - Narses the Eunuch and the Pragmatic Sanction (554)
		 - Justinian's sanction, royal decree that is valid as law immediately
		 - Justinian creates Italy as province of Eastern Roman Empire, not a subject kingdom
			 - Capital is Ravenna, not Rome (still fighting with Ostrogoths)
		 - Nobody in Italy was actually governing anything anymore with all the issues
			 - Regained the territory, but does it functionally do anything
 - The War in Spain: 551, Athanagild asks for the Emperor's help

### The Sasanian Empire
 - Sasanian Dynasty: 224-651
 - After the third century crisis, the Roman Empire and Sasanian Empire was mostly peaceful

**Visual Propaganda**:
 - Imposing Buildings: Giant monuments, similar to the Roman Empire
 - Symbolic Reliefs: Such as the one that shows conquered Roman emperors
 - Ceremonials: Ceremony to show how strong they are, give the people what they wanted
 - Coinage: Depict the king, people need to feel close to their leader
 - Silverware: Plates with mythical monsters to represent the empire
 - Monarchy: Creating a similar idea to Rome, where the Emperor is the Roman State
 - Zoroastrianism (magi): Controversial to scholars
	 - A group of magi (high priests), still technically under the emperor
	 - Perform rituals to make the community come together

**Emperors: The Example of Khusro**:
 - Not a Roman source, talks about a different type of administration
 - Concerns the reforms of Khosro Anushirwan
 - Issues in the territory with subjects being able to pay taxes
	 - Plague is ongoing, poverty is common
 - Previous emperors would remove the tax burden for 1-2 years, and ease it occasionally in order to restore their strength for the field work
	 - Does not want to do the same thing
 - Assembles officials and tax payers, realized there was no remedy for the situation
	 - Wants to fix the administration
	 - Taxation is typically unfair, or not collected properly
 - Wants to make the taxes just, fixes their rates on every town, district, village, man
	 - Nominated trusted men to be in charge of this administration
 - Instructed tax payers to submit complaints to the judges, who oversee the districts
	 - No officials should be able to add anything to the amount owed
 - Need to make things fair, otherwise it makes their army and people weaker and strengthens their enemies
 - Fought with Armenians, who had a strong victory against them
	 - Captured the royal pavilion, and kept Khosrov alive and in charge for 48 years
	 - He was such a good king, even other cultures took notice
