Diocletian was an author of crimes and a deviser of evils; he ruined everything and could not even keep his hands from God. In his greed and anxiety he turned the whole world upside down. He appointed three men to share his rule, dividing the world into four parts and multiplying the armies, since each of the four strove to have a far larger number of troops than previous emperors had had when they were governing the state alone. The number of recipients began to exceed the number of contributors by so much that, with farmers’ resources exhausted by the enormous size of the requisitions, fields became deserted and cultivated land was turned into forest. To ensure that terror was universal, provinces too were cut into fragments; many governors and even more officials were imposed on individual regions, almost on individual cities, and to these were added numerous accountants, controllers, and prefects’ deputies. The activities of all these people were very rarely civil; they engaged only in repeated condemnations and confiscations, and in exacting endless resources – and the exactions were not just frequent, they were incessant, and involved insupportable injustices. And how could the arrangements for raising soldiers be endured?

The same Diocletian with his insatiable greed was never willing that his treasuries should be depleted; he was always amassing surplus wealth and funds for largess so that he could keep what he was storing complete and inviolate. Since too by his various misdeeds he was causing an immense rise in prices, he tried to fix by law the prices of goods put up for sale. Much blood was then shed over small and cheap items; in the general alarm nothing appeared for sale, and the rise in prices got much worse until, after many had met their deaths, sheer necessity led to the repeal of the law.

In addition, Diocletian had a limitless passion for building, which led to an equally limitless scouring of the provinces to raise workers, craftsmen, wagons, and whatever is necessary for building operations. Here he built basilicas, there  a circus, a mint, an arms-factory, here he built a house for his wife, there one for his daughter...

**Context**:
 - When: Written sometime after 316 CE
 - Where:
 - What motivated the author: Hatred of Diocletian's regime, as a Christian author he suffered under Diocletian's persecutions
 - Expected audience:
 - Do we need to be careful with this source: Yes, Lactantius hates Diocletian and his writings on him are incredibly biased

**Content**:
 - It is essentially a list of statements about the changes Diocletian enacted with how the Roman Empire was managed. If you can read through his thinly veiled hatred for the Emperor you can see that this is just a list of historical facts.
 - Appointed three additional emperors to rule the empire with him, dividing the empire into four parts. Each part had its own army with an increased number of total soldiers.
 - Potential lack in fertile farmland to ration the increased military size and their food requisitions
 - Provinces were divided further into fragments, with additional governors and new officials to be administrating the new fragments, some even set to administrate individual cities.
	 - Higher level of bureaucracy
 - New taxes instated by Diocletian, seen here as a way to amass surplus personal wealth
 - High inflation on all goods. An attempt was made to set fixed prices for all goods in order to combat the rapidly declining economy causing an increase in the rate of crime. This law was later repealed
 - Diocletian was a great builder, raising a large number of resources and workers in order to build large structures.

**Significance**:
 - It is a brief list of major changes as part of Diocletian's regime.
 - Good starting point to understanding this period of the Roman Empire
