### Diocletian and the Tetrarchy
 - Ruling of the Four: 284-305
	 - Started in two phases
 - Son of a freedman from Dalmatia, did not have a political or noble background
	 - Gave himself a name from working with the army
 - 285: Appointed Maximian, fellow soldier and friend, as caesar
	 - Would call themselves brothers
	 - 286: Both equal in ranks (both Augustus)
	 - Minted coins with themselves on one side and the two most important deities on the other (Jupiter & ???). Together, they are the Empire
 - Diocletian realized that the empire was too big, the menaces from various fronts were growing
	 - Two men were not enough
	 - Started the tetrarchy: A division of the empire into West and East, and then further into two smaller parts (293)
 - The four rulers will be two augusti (Diocletian and Maximian) and two caesars (Galerius and Constantius)
	 - West: Maximian & Constantius
	 - East: Diocletian & Galerius
 - The legion was very difficult to manage, began leaving parts of the army in different territories to be managed by governors that were managed by the Tetrarchy
	 - Governors were originally warlords of Augustus, eventually took on more responsibilities and power
 - Division between military careers and political careers was very blurred, Diocletian began to break this up with a new provincial system
	 - From 50-100
	 - *Praesides*: Governors of a single province w/out military power. Oversee *Duces* & *Comites*
		 - *Duces* & *Comites*: Military control of the province for emergencies (don't require the whole army)
	 - *Vicarii*: Appointed by emperor to oversee the dioceses
		 - Look over groups of provinces (dioceses are groups of provinces)
	 - *Prefects*: Military role, previously the prefects had to oversee all governors of all provinces
		 - Now only deal with administration of the army and imperial court

### The Tetrarchy
 - Tetrarchy statue is to symbolize one united empire, not individual emperors
	 - The emperors in the statue are not designed after any one person
 - Augusti are the ones with the arms on the Caesars, demonstrating that they have more power

### Diocletian
 - **Army**: From the legion to smaller troops (1000 men)
	 - Creation of regional generals (Duces and Comites)
	 - Total number of the military grew to 600k soldiers
 - **Economy & Coinage**: New mints, gold, silver, and bronze coins
	 - New taxes
 - **Imperial Court**: *Consilium* (council) and *comitatus* (itinerant officials)
 - **Great Persecutions**: Christian persecution
	 - 299: expulsions from the army
	 - 303: he ordered to destroy the Church in Nicomedia and to arrest clergymen
	 - 304: obligatory public sacrifices
	 - Book burnings, seizing of properties

**301: Edict on Maximum Prices**
 - Huge inflation on everything, prices through the roof
 - Diocletian attempts to define the price of every single thing in the empire
	 - Very detailed, wasn't really followed despite risk of capital penalty
 - 305: Finally revoked after years of failure

**Principate to the Dominate: A New Era in the Roman Empire**:
 - Dominate: The emperor is now officially a *dominus*, not a *princeps* (military leader)
	 - *Primus*: *Inter Pares*, first among equals
		 - Propaganda to make it seem as though the emperor is working together with the senate, not just doing things that they want to do
	 - *Dominus*: Lord/Owner
 - Crown and Mantle: Changing how the emperors appear, now dressed as the visible ruler of Rome
 - Prostration and Kiss of the Cloak: Must kneel before the emperor and kiss their cloak
	 - Previously, kneeling was considered as bad form
 - The Standing Council: The only one sitting in a thrown is the emperor, the rest of the council must stand
