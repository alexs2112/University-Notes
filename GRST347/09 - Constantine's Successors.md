### Bloodline
 - Constantine did not have a direct bloodline
 - A fight for power with the other children of his father Constantius
 - Eventually, Constantius II comes out ahead (353-361)

**Constantius II**:
 - Emperor comes to town: Marvellous chariot of gold and precious stones
	 - Presents himself like a statue. Stares straight ahead, does not move or touch his face
 - Defeated by his own troops, making way for Julian to come to power

### Julian - 361-362
 - Julian portrayed himself as an extremely victorious general, whatever small accomplishment he had on the battlefield he would message to the entire empire
	 - They started making fun of him
 - Julian is bearded, unlike Constantine
	 - The last pagan empire, the Christians named him the Apostate (renounced religion)
	 - Tries to restore the empire to a pagan state
 - Reigned only for 20 months

**Education**:
 - We have historical accounts and his own writings
 - Despite his military achievements, he is an intellectual
	 - Greek language
	 - Christian literature
	 - Classical literature
	 - Neoplatonic philosophy
 - His teachers were all christian, he despised christian literature
	 - He tries to put a stop to teachers not teaching classical literature
	 - Separate the curriculum, have christian teachers teach christian literature and not classical literature as they will not teach it correctly

**Paganism and Religious Politics**:
 - Loves the Greek culture, utilizes their paganism and wants to bring back their practices
 - Divination: Asking the gods for answers of the future
	 - Theurgy: Type of divination, ability of humans to ask the gods to help them do tasks
 - Animal Sacrifice: Other pagans do not like blood sacrifice, Julian brings them back
	 - It has been a very long time since the other pagans did animal sacrifice
 - Personal Syncretism (Helios=Mithras)
	 - Syncretistic mono-theism using the sun god Helios as Mithras
		 - Most important deity in the pantheon of Julian
 - Moral Standard: Not a lot of pressure on him from moral standards
	 - Christians think that he needs to be extremely moral as the emperor, lead by example
 - Other pagans think Julian is a fake believer and does not have proper pagan values
	 - His influences started w/ Christianity before moving to paganism, become intertwined
	 - Christians also hate him
 - No persecutions: Needs to find a middle ground between him and christians
	 - He is attacking Christianity with his other ideas
 - Suspension of special rights for clergy
	 - Clergies have received special rights (power, taxes, property) for helping the emperor
	 - Julian removed all special rights that have been developed by this relationship in the past
	 - Trying to cut ties between empire and church
 - Push for pagan state rituals: Doesn't force the Christians to do them (unless they are administrators)

**Administration**:
 - Very idealized ideas about the polis (Greek city-states)
	 - Wants to make them the center of everything once again
 - New rights to the cities:
	 - Right to collect taxes and revenues from their territories
		 - Big problem, administrative point of view is telling the cities to deal with themselves and their problems
	 - Enlargement of city councils
		 - City councils need to be expanded to administer themselves
	 - Reduction of state tax demands
		 - Independence, but at cost of losing out on the full empire (less money, less involved)

**Persian Campaign**:
 - Julian's fatal invasion of Mesopotamia. Defeated almost immediately
	 - Factions in the army, things were not going great internally
 - He was killed off by the Sassanians after attempting to siege a city that his advisors told him was impossible
	 - Very defensible, and the king would be showing up very soon with a huge army
	 - Accused his generals of being lazy, that they wanted to leave the almost defeated Persians so they could go home and chill out
 - Sassanian relief shows Mithra, Shapur II, Ahura Mazda above a defeated Julian, lying prostrate
