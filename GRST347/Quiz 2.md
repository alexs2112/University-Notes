 - Anchorite: From *anachoreo* (to go away, withdraw)
 - Eremos: Of the desert
 - Stylite: Pillar-dweller
 - Cenobitic: Common life, community lifestyle, monks sharing lives with other monks

**Anthansius, *Life of Antony***:
 - Devil hates monks, attempts to lead them away from discipline

	 - Then created large pillar, stood on it for 5 years and became famous, people sought him out

**Sexuality & Extreme Asceticism**:
 - 153 Canons of the Council of Gangra: If anyone condemns these things, let them be anathema (bad)
	 - Marriage, cooked meat, slaves, women clothes
	 - Fake virginity (because you hate sex instead of wanting the holiness of virginity)

**John Cassianus and Monastic Rule**:
 - Monk robes purely for covering the body, not become seed of vanity and pride
	 - Calling them "Covering", not "raiment", merely to cover the body
 - Robes should be clean, free from anxious carefulness, and common property of all monks
 - Upon admission, monks stripped of all possessions, don't even keep their clothes
	 - Redressed by abbots, given up all objects and laid aside all *worldly pride*
 - Supported no longer by wealth, rations received from holy funds of monastery as payment for service

### Funerary Landscape
 - Necropolis: City of the dead with household tombs, collegia (associations), and individual tombs
 - Catacombs: Rise of collective burials
 - Festivals: Rituals connected to funerary spaces, praying and rituals done for the dead in the necropolis
 - Relics and Martyrdom: Collect relics and bodies of saints & martyrs, create tombs for people to pray
 - Defixiones: Places for pagans to connect to the underworld

**Changes to Burial Practices**: Centuries of incineration to inhumation of full body
 - Individual/household tombs -> communal burials
 - Decrease in epigraphic practice of the rich paying for monumental tombs
	 - Previously bodies thrown onto the streets if they could not afford a burial
 - Huge change in Roman society: Burials within the city walls and in churches
	 - Previously: Didn't want to pollute community with the deceased so buried outside the city

**Sacred Island Necropoli**: Western side of Rome on the coast, eventually covered in sand and abandoned
 - Constructed in 1st century, not in heavy use until 3rd century, excavated in 1940s
 - Household tombs together with individual tombs, group tombs for organizations
 - Large central road going through it, very well trafficked, built the same as major trade routes
	 - Major tombs off the side of the road, smaller ones on side roads, society all about public display
 - Family tombs look like houses, preserve household structure. Individual commemorations are small
	 - Aedicola: Pillar structure, inscription with shrine for ashes

**Smaller Individual Burials**:
 - Terracotta Ollae: Vase preserves ashes in small nooks in the tomb

 - Amphora Burial: Very long amphoras, body interred in it and then buried. Small monument with name
 - Cassone: "Big Box", body protected and laid to rest within Cassone, inscription placed on outside

**Catacombs and Early Christian Art**: *Catacumbas* - subterranean cemetery near Via Appia
 - Vast subterranean networks of tombs, openings on walls called *loculi*, easy and cheap to build
 - Everyone buried as equals within their community, very difficult to find specific people
 - Christians and Pagans originally buried in same areas, impossible to distinguish
 - Eventually Christians began using these spaces to start representing Christian art, no longer pagan
 - Monteverde Catacombs, Rome: Jewish catacomb, symbolisms of old testament over walls and ceilings

**Celebrations for the Dead**:
 - Parantalia: 13-21 Feb, important, dead able to walk on Earth once more, bring them food and flowers
	 - Celebration to appease spirits, make sure they are happy to not get haunted
 - Christian Funerals: Example of Monica, mother of Augustine of Hippo
	 - Many celebrations were similar with prayers and offerings. Inhumations
 - Martyrs: People would pray in their tombs, pay for privilege of being buried close to the martyr

### Constantine's Successors
 - Did not have direct bloodline, fight with other children of father Constantius, Constantius II wins
 - Constantius II: Marvellous chariot of gold and precious stones, presents self as a statue (immobile)
	 - Defeated by his own troops, making way for Julian to come to power

**Julian**: 361-362
 - Portrayed as extremely victorious general, would mail every tiny accomplishment to entire empire
 - Julian is bearded, last pagan empire, Christians named him Apostate (renounced religion)

	 - Divination & Theurgy: Asking gods for help to do certain tasks
	 - Animal Sacrifice: Other pagans did not like blood sacrifice, been a long time since they stopped
	 - Personal Syncretism: Syncretistic monotheism, sun god Helios as Mithras, most important deity
	 - Moral Standards: Not many, Christians think he needs to be very moral to lead by example
	 - No Persecutions: Tries to find middle ground between him and Christians
	 - Suspension of Special Rights of the Clergy: Removes all special rights clergies had from helping previous emperors. Trying to cut ties between empire and church
	 - Pagan State Rituals: Pushes for them, doesnt force Christians to do them (unless administrators)
 - Other pagans think he is a fake believer w/out pagan values, Christians also hate him
 - Idealized ideas about the Polis (Greek city-states), wants to make them central to empire again
	 - Rights to collect taxes and revenues from their territories. Big problem, telling cities to deal with themselves and their problems on their own
	 - City councils need to expand in order to administer themselves
	 - Reduces state tax demands, independence cost losing out on empire (less money & involvement)
 - Fatal invasion of Mesopotamia, factions in army and internal struggles
	 - Killed by Sassanians after attempting to siege city his advisors told him was impossible
	 - Sassanian relief shows Mithra, Shapur II, Ahura Mazda above defeated Julian lying prostrate

### Valentiniac Dynasty
 - Child emperors Valentinian (West) and Valens (East), no direct link to Constantine's bloodline
	 - Valentinian I has strong personality, took the lead on everything important
	 - Promotes son Gratian to role of Augustus
 - Rebellion: Huge number of successors
	 - Jovian: Publicly supported
	 - Procopius: From Constantinople, family line of Julian, supported by Gaul and Rome

**Military Issues**:
 - Rhine/Danube Frontier: Originally peaceful
	 - Invading Huns put pressure on Gauls, who moved into Roman territory
	 - Valentinian realized fighting led to nothing, started successful diplomatic process
 - Ritualized Diplomacy: *Foedus* (treaty), treats the others as equals as diplomatic ritual
	 - Mostly for show, establishes they will not wage war and provide equal support to each other
 - Puts levies on the barbarians to help establish the borders, join the army to help defeat enemies
 - Valentinian I spends a ton of money (debt) to construct and refurbish forts and watch posts
 - 365: Dies in fit of apoplectic anger, seizure (people came to say their groups were treated unlawfully)
 - Generalissimo called Justinia (Valentinian's Wife) and made Valentinian II the Augustus
	 - Valentinian II is 4 years old, Gratian is 16, need to be 18 to be a grown man, 2 augusti in the west
	 - Justinia and old aristocracy (generals) have the real power, resurgence in oligarchy
 - In the East: Valens wages war w/ Goth groups pressuring him, travelled Constantinople -> Adrianople
	 - Battle of Adrianople: "Worst Roman defeat since Cannae" (Hannibal)
	 - Valens and 10k men died, emperors body was never recovered
		 - Emperors will no longer personally engage enemies beyond the borders of Rome

**Theodosius I**:
 - Now: Two children rule in the West, Valens killed in the East
 - Theodosius brought from forced retirement to become head of the Roman empire
	 - Huge support from the army, came from military family
 - Raises Magnus Maximus to power, marches to Italy to get approval from Valentinian II & Gratian
 - Empress Justinia was Christian (Aryan Christian), put forth edict of toleration towards Aryan Christians
	 - Political infighting, usurper Ambrose comes to power, orthodox Christian civil war
	 - Justinia says her family will revert to orthodoxy, gives daughter to Theodosius to fight usurper
 - Marriage union between the two bloodlines, emperors of East and West
	 - Goes to Italy to become full Augustus, fights usurper
	 - Gratian dies in battle, Valentinian II sent away under army and generals, house arrest

### Roman State Organization
 - Two biggest expenses for Roman Empire: Army and Annona
	 - Annona Militaris & Civilis: Provides resources to people in Rome & Constantinople who could not afford them. Every year, state buys grains and subsidizes it for the poor
 - Iugatio-Capitatio: As subject of empire, must provide services
	 - Taxation system to convert service to money owed to the state
 - Census (indiction): Every 50 years (indiction period), assess each city to see economy and taxes
 - Bureaucracy: Administrators needed to understand both Latin & Greek, took test before taking office

**System of Justice**: People appeal up the ladder, can go all the way up to the emperor himself
 - Idea: All officials are judges on cases, solve problems if they can, otherwise send upwards
 - Political decisions made passively, officials solving problems on the emperors behalf

**Communication System**: Large focus on harbour and ship-building in this period
 - Army needs to efficiently receive communication orders
 - Court officials constantly moving, letters must quickly find their recipients
 - Mansiones: Roadhouses for travellers to rest and prepare, could trade horses, completely locked down
