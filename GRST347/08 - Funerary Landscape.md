### Funerary Landscape in Late Antiquity Rome
 - **Necropolis**: The city of the dead
	 - Household tombs
	 - Collegia (associations)
	 - Individual tombs
 - **Catacombs**: The rise of collective burials
 - **Festivals**: Rituals connected to these funerary spaces
	 - Active praying and rituals done for the dead in the necropolis
 - **Relics and Martyrdom**: Start to gather the relics bodies of saints and martyrs
	 - Create tombs for these martyrs and saints for people to pray at
 - **Defixiones**: Places for pagans to connect to the underworld
 - Whenever big societal changes happen, the first thing we see are changes in funerary practices

### Changes to Burial Practices in late Antiquity
 - Changes in patterns in funerary practices
 - From incineration to inhumation
	 - Romans had used ritual incineration for centuries
	 - Entire body laid down to rest instead of just the ashes
 - From individual/household tombs to communal burials
 - Decrease of epigraphic practice
	 - The rich paying for and constructing monumental tombs, burial is a private matter that is supported by the rich
	 - If you didn't have a family to take care of you your body would be thrown out (health issue)
 - From private to religious matters
 - In the 5th century: Burials inside the city walls and in Churches
	 - Previously: Don't want to pollute the community with the deceased
	 - Christian's didn't have this issue
	 - **Huge change in Roman society**

**Issues with Modern Archaeology**:
 - Many archaeological issues to understand the past
 - Constant rebuilding, reusing, tons of people living in the society and building on top of things
	 - Antiquarianism of the 1500+s, Europeans collecting ancient relics
 - Inscriptions are important, their location is just as important as what is written on it
	 - Etc: inscriptions above family tombs, on back roads, main roads
	 - We have no idea where they came from now that they have been looted
 - Galleria Lapidaria, Vatican Museums: Ancient inscriptions all plastered together into a wall
 - Claustrum of S. Paolo Fuori le Mura, Rome: Many tombstones also put into the wall
	 - These two examples are to prove how Christianity prevailed but otherwise useless for researchers
