### Funerary Landscape in Late Antiquity Rome
 - **Necropolis**: The city of the dead
	 - Household tombs
	 - Collegia (associations)
	 - Individual tombs
 - **Catacombs**: The rise of collective burials
 - **Festivals**: Rituals connected to these funerary spaces
	 - Active praying and rituals done for the dead in the necropolis
 - **Relics and Martyrdom**: Start to gather the relics bodies of saints and martyrs
	 - Create tombs for these martyrs and saints for people to pray at
 - **Defixiones**: Places for pagans to connect to the underworld
 - Whenever big societal changes happen, the first thing we see are changes in funerary practices

### Changes to Burial Practices in late Antiquity
 - Changes in patterns in funerary practices
 - From incineration to inhumation
	 - Romans had used ritual incineration for centuries
	 - Entire body laid down to rest instead of just the ashes
 - From individual/household tombs to communal burials
 - Decrease of epigraphic practice
	 - The rich paying for and constructing monumental tombs, burial is a private matter that is supported by the rich
	 - If you didn't have a family to take care of you your body would be thrown out (health issue)
 - From private to religious matters
 - In the 5th century: Burials inside the city walls and in Churches
	 - Previously: Don't want to pollute the community with the deceased
	 - Christian's didn't have this issue
	 - **Huge change in Roman society**

**Issues with Modern Archaeology**:
 - Many archaeological issues to understand the past
 - Constant rebuilding, reusing, tons of people living in the society and building on top of things
	 - Antiquarianism of the 1500+s, Europeans collecting ancient relics
 - Inscriptions are important, their location is just as important as what is written on it
	 - Etc: inscriptions above family tombs, on back roads, main roads
	 - We have no idea where they came from now that they have been looted
 - Galleria Lapidaria, Vatican Museums: Ancient inscriptions all plastered together into a wall
 - Claustrum of S. Paolo Fuori le Mura, Rome: Many tombstones also put into the wall
	 - These two examples are to prove how Christianity prevailed but otherwise useless for researchers

### Sacred Island Necropoli
![[sacred_island.png|400]]
 - Necropoli on the western side called the "Sacred Island"
 - Eventually began to get covered in sand, had to be abandoned
	 - Biggest excavation of this place happened around the 1940s
	 - Excavated and the space is completely intact
 - Was constructed in the first century, all inscriptions in the building point to it not being in heavy use until the 3rd century (up until its abandonment)
	 - Household tombs together with individual tombs
	 - Group tombs for members of organizations
 - Large central road that runs straight, surrounded by buildings
	 - Very well trafficked road, built the same as major trade routes
 - Important tombs next to road for everyone to see, Roman society was all about public display
	 - Much smaller tombs off of the side road
![[sacred_island_street.png|500]]
 - The family tombs just look like houses, preserves the household structure
 - Individual commemorations are much smaller
	 - Aedicola: Pillar structure, little inscription at the bottom, then a larger shrine on top with space for the ashes

**Example Tomb Inscriptions**:
 - Many inscriptions, shrines, and tombs towards individual people, not necessarily powerful people. Such as the wives of tradesmen
```
To the Gods of the Underworld, Tiberius Claudius Euthychus made to Claudia Memnonis, a well-deserving wife, and to himself, to their freedmen and freedwomen. Walkable around. This monument does not go to the heirs. XV feet in the front, XV feet (deep) to the field.
```
 - Public display that also acts as a legal document, the heirs cannot be buried here
	 - Walkable around is rare, they bought the lot just for people to walk around (like a lawn)
```
To the Gods of the Underworld  

Titus Aelius Onesas, a freedman of the emperor, to Sulpicia Margaris, good wife, and to himself and his freedmen and freedwomen and to their descendants; length 8 feet, width 30 feet.
```

### Smaller Individual Burials
![[Smaller_Burials.png|300]]
 - 1. Terracotta Ollae
	 - Vase after being incinerated, then preserved in small nooks carved out in the tomb
 - 2. Simple Underground Burial
	 - Still need to buy a small plot of land, enough to be designated a sacred space
	 - We start seeing a change as many people begin to get interred instead of incinerated
 - 3. A Cappuccina
	 - The body would be laid to rest
	 - A structure is then created out of tiles to cover the body
	 - The bodies are typically not in great shape, they decompose quickly, we still have the tiles
	 - Cheaper than the next options, tiles are very inexpensive and cover large areas
 - 4. Amphora Burial
	 - Very very long amphoras, the body is essentially interred in it and then buried
	 - Then you get a small monument with your name
 - 5. A Cassone
	 - Cassone = "Big Box"
	 - Body is protected and laid to rest within the Cassone
	 - An inscription is placed on the outside
 - Shift in how members of society are being perceived through inscriptions on individual burials

### Catacombs and Early Christian Art
 - Catacombs comes from a location near the Via Appia where the bodies were buried in holes
	 - Could be excavated in a way to not have them collapse, didn't need big plots of land
	 - *Catacumbas*: Name of this subterranean cemetery
 - Vast subterranean networks of galleries and chambers used as tombs
	 - The openings on the walls were the bodies called *loculi*
	 - Easy and cheap places to build, just dig into the Earth and create a catacomb
 - Catacombs versus other burial locations:
	 - Everyone is buried as equals, they are with their community
	 - Very difficult to find a single person
 - Christians and Pagans were originally buried in the same areas, impossible to distinguish
 - At some point, Christians began using these spaces far more
	 - They never used these places for mass or church service
	 - They used the spaces as a start of representing Christianity in art
		 - Many representations from the old and new testaments
		 - No longer creating myths and pagan stories, now representing Christian stories
	 - Many new symbols were inscribed within the tombs, the Chi Rho, the fish (Jesus Christ), vases (good deeds), dove and olive branches (from the old testament)
 - Monteverde Catacombs, Rome: Jewish catacomb, symbolisms of the old testament decorates the walls and ceilings
	 - Jewish catacombs are beginning to decorate their tombs at the same time as the Christians

### Celebrations for the Dead
 - Pagan Funeral
 - Parantalia: 13-21 February
	 - Very important festival, the dead are able to walk on the Earth once more
	 - Celebration to appease the spirits and make sure they are not upset
		 - Bring them flowers and food, their shades ask little
		 - "Tile wreathed with garlands is enough, a scattering of meal, a few grains of salt"
	 - Neglecting the Festival of the Dead will have you punished by the spirits
 - Christian Funeral: the example of Monica, mother of Augustine of Hippo
	 - Many celebrations were quite similar with prayers and offerings
	 - Care of the body was also similar (after change from cremation to inhumation)
 - Martyrs
	 - People would pray in the tombs of these martyrs
	 - They also pay for the privilege of being buried closest to the martyr
		 - Spaces in the catacombs are not considered equal

**Witchcraft**:
 - The dark power of the underworld
 - Necropoli and catacombs are connections between underworld and earth
 - Many people in this period practiced witchcraft
 - Found cursed goblets that would be buried with your tomb to curse somebody that is alive
