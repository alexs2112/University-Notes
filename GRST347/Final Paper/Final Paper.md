**Thesis**:
The laws regarding Christian educators put forth by Emperor Julian was a critical piece in the extremist pagan reformations he proposed. However it created immediate controversy within both Christian and pagan communities, being a direct cause of a negative public perception of Julian's short reign as Emperor.

[Analysis of the primary source]
*Julian on Proper Education* is an edict written by the emperor Julian in 362 that formed a major part of his religious reformations, earning him the title of "the Apostate" by the Christian church. This edict attempted to prevent Christian educators from teaching the traditional curriculum under the belief that these teachers would be unable to properly teach this content.  Julian claims that it is absurd that these men dishonor the old gods with their teaching of pagan material with a Christian bias, and that in doing so they fail to be an honest man and are "shamefully greedy of gain" [PS].  He claims that this greed allows these Christians to put up with anything, able to make a livelihood and receive payment from teaching the works of pagan writers that they believe are wrong about their beliefs.  This rolls into the primary point of the emperor's argument, concerning how the Christian church believe that the classical pagan writers of old, such as Hesiod and Homer, are in error with their beliefs of "the most honored gods" [PS]. As Julian is a known pagan, his bias in favour of these pagan writers and their religion of worshipping the old gods is very clear. He gives Christian educators an ultimatum, to either stop teaching what they "do not think admirable" [PS], or to first persuade their students that these sources which they have condemned as Christians are actually truthful and "is such as \[the original authors] declare" [PS]. If these teachers continue to believe that the pagan writers were in error regarding religion then they must retreat to their temples and leave the sphere of education. Julian ends his edict with a final command overflowing with anti-Christian bias, such that any child who wishes to attend these now-pagan schools must be allowed to, even if they are already being raised as "demented" Christians. He expresses that it would be unreasonable to prevent boys from being educated to instead indoctrinate them into Christianity. "For we ought, I think, to teach, but not to punish the demented" [PS]
