**Thesis**:
The laws regarding Christian educators put forth by Emperor Julian was a critical piece in the extremist pagan reformations he proposed. However it created immediate controversy within both Christian and pagan communities, being a direct cause of a negative public perception of Julian's short reign as Emperor.
 - Maybe this can be reworded that the negative public perception of Julian's edict comes from a place of intense Christian bias and is not reflected in Julian's other administrative actions during his reign. (might be hard to add this given our sources)
 - Maybe say it is a conservative reformation to the education system that was seen incredibly negatively by the Christian community without reflecting his other actions

### Introduction (300 words)

### Paragraph 1 (350 words)
[Analysis of the primary source]
*Julian on Proper Education* is an edict written by the emperor Julian in 362 that formed a major part of his religious reformations, earning him the title of "the Apostate" by the Christian church. This edict attempted to prevent Christian educators from teaching the traditional curriculum under the belief that these teachers would be unable to properly teach this content.  Julian claims that it is absurd that these men dishonor the old gods with their teaching of pagan material with a Christian bias, and that in doing so they fail to be an honest man and are "shamefully greedy of gain" [PS].  He claims that this greed allows these Christians to put up with anything, able to make a livelihood and receive payment from teaching the works of pagan writers that they believe are wrong about their beliefs.  This rolls into the primary point of the emperor's argument, concerning how the Christian church believe that the classical pagan writers of old, such as Hesiod and Homer, are in error with their beliefs of "the most honored gods" [PS]. As Julian is a known pagan, his bias in favour of these pagan writers and their religion of worshipping the old gods is very clear. He gives Christian educators an ultimatum, to either stop teaching what they "do not think admirable" [PS], or to first persuade their students that these sources which they have condemned as Christians are actually truthful and "is such as \[the original authors] declare" [PS]. If these teachers continue to believe that the pagan writers were in error regarding religion then they must retreat to their temples and leave the sphere of education. Julian ends his edict with a final command overflowing with anti-Christian bias, such that any child who wishes to attend these now-pagan schools must be allowed to, even if they are already being raised as "demented" Christians. He expresses that it would be unreasonable to prevent boys from being educated to instead indoctrinate them into Christianity. "For we ought, I think, to teach, but not to punish the demented" [PS]
### Paragraph 2 (400 words)
[Why interpretation is difficult and the bias that is present in interpretations]
 - There are several problems that make interpretation of Julian's reform difficult for modern scholars.
 - Content and structure of these regulations must be reconstructed as there may have been lost sources that refer to the topic [Vossing]
 - Primary source is viewed as rhetoric by the emperor, not a direct representation in how reformations were applied in the empire [Vossing]
 - Interpretation of Legislation is dependent on true intention of the emperor [Vossing]
 - Other secondary sources for examples of how the regulations can be reconstructed
 - Other secondary sources for interpretation of Julian's intent
 - Closing discussion about the emperors bias against Christians (Probably [Wayman])
 - [Hardy] acknowledges the conflicting bias between Christian interpretations and the historical sources of Julian's conduct as administrator
	 - Possible source for the positive things: https://www.jstor.org/stable/985994?seq=7
	 - [Hardy, 136] These negative interpretations are incompatible with the generous and approving stamp placed on the emperor's economy and conduct as an administrator
### Paragraph 3 (400 words)
[Opinions of affected Christian educators of antiquity, Basil of Caesarea]
 - We have mentions of Basil from both [Wayman]  and [Cribiore]
 - Probably can mention Chrysostom [Cribiore] and the Christian community of Antioch
	 - Hopefully there is a good section we can add here about Antioch and how they are affected
 - Basil's Address to Young Men on the Right Use of Greek Literature [Wayman]
 - Contrast his ideas that Greek literature is only useful to Christians when it is selectively interpreted against Julian's ideas that these Christian teachers must either agree with the full pagan text or to not teach it at all
 - Directly compare the difference between what Julian considers a proper Greek education with how Basil thought of the use of Greek literature [Warman]
### Paragraph 4 (400 words)
[Opinions of "modern" scholars and how they interpret the reformations, modern church]
 - Julian's tampering with the education system of the Roman Empire is negative, how this reformation was interpreted by modern scholars, Johannes Geffcken (1908), Norman H. Baynes (1924-1936), and Joseph Bidez (1930) [Hardy]
	 - Also Dvornik (1955)
 - These scholars emphasize Julian's reformations as the most egregious of his Christian repressions (can maybe add this to Paragraph 2 as well) [Hardy]
 - Start with the massively negative response to the edict, affected Christians such as Basil [Wayman] and pagan historians like Ammianus Marcellinus [Hardy] (try to use a different source)
	 - "Julian as a religious bigot, anxious to deny Christianity of all cultural nourishment"
	 - "Assure its eventual relegation to barbarism"
	 - Favourable opinions of the life and reign of Julian were either lost or suppressed, survey by Bidez in 1930 [Hardy, 133]
	 - Bidez claims that during the Renaissance, Julian and his school law continued to have an overall very negative opinion and that his evil toward Christianity "far outweighed whatever good there was in him" [Hardy, 133]
 - By the twentieth century, studies have become more positive towards the reign of Julian. Geffcken calls for a greater balance in how the anti-Christian school law is interpreted, however the negative Christian imprint on the interpretations of the emperor's actions remains. [Hardy 134]
 - Baynes has claimed in his article in *The Cambridge Medieval History* that accounts of the emperor are the results of religious reaction and must be considered with that bias in mind. [Hardy 134] 
 - Francis Dvornik studied the emperors political writings (1955) and finds evidence that Julian intended to return to earlier Roman constitutional habits, avoiding the "theocratic absolutionism of recent times" [Hardy 138]
	 - Wanted to revive the older Roman concept where the *Princeps* was both subjec tto and a guardian of the law, rather than its personification. (reword this)
	 - Dvornik suggests that the school law is related to Julian's conservative political vision, rather than persecution of the Christian faith out of his own personal hatred of it [Hardy 138]
