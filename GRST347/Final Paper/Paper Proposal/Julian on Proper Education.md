 - The emperor Julian “the Apostate,” writing in 362, attempted to prevent Christians from teaching the traditional curriculum. He argued that it was fundamentally dishonest to teach material in which one did not believe.

I hold that a proper education results, not in laboriously acquired symmetry of 
phrases and language, but in a healthy condition of mind, I mean a mind that 
has understanding and true opinions about things good and evil, honorable and 
base. Therefore, when a man thinks one thing and teaches his pupils another, in 
my opinion he fails to educate exactly in proportion as he fails to be an honest 
man . . . I think it is absurd that men \[the poets and orators of Greece who 
acknowledged that the gods had inspired them and who expound the works of 
these writers] should dishonor the gods whom they used to honor. Yet, though 
I think this is absurd, I do not say that they ought to change their opinions and 
then instruct the young. But I give them this choice; either not to teach what 
they do not think admirable, or if they wish to teach, let them first really 
persuade their pupils that neither Homer nor Hesiod nor any of these writers 
whom they expound and have declared to be guilty of impiety, folly and error 
in regard to the gods, is such as they declare. For since they make a livelihood 
and receive pay from the works of these writers, they thereby confess that they 
are most shamefully greedy of gain, and that for the sake of a few drachmas 
they would put up with anything . . . If they believe that those whose inter- 
preters they are and for whom they sit, so to speak, in the seat of the prophets, 
were wise men, let them be the first to emulate their piety towards the gods. If, 
however, they think that those writers were in error with respect to the most 
honored gods, then let them betake themselves to the churches of the Galileans 
to expound Matthew and Luke, since you Galileans are obeying them when 
you ordain that men shall refrain from temple-worship. For my part, I would 
say that your ears and your tongues might be “born anew,” as you would say, 
as regards these things in which may I ever have part, and all who think and act 
as is pleasing to me. For religious and secular teachers let there be a general 
ordinance to this effect: Any youth who wishes to attend the schools is not 
excluded; nor indeed would it be reasonable to shut out from the best way boys 
who are still too ignorant to know which way to turn, and to overawe them into 
being led against their will, as one cures the insane, except that we concede 
indulgence to all for this sort of disease. For we ought, I think, to teach, but not 
to punish the demented.
