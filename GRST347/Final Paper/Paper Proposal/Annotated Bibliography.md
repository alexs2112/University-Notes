### Secondary Sources
**Julian against Christian educators: Julian and Basil on a proper education**:          
This is an article written by Benjamin D. Wayman, published by Christian Scholar's Review. The source compares the different views on education between Emperor Julian and the fourth-century Christian known as Basil of Caesarea. This is done through outlining Julian's view of a proper Greek education, outlined in his edict and rescript on education, before being contrasted by the opinions displayed by Basil  in his Address to Young Men on the Right Use of Greek Literature. Basil's writings are shown to demonstrate the idea that Greek literature is only useful to Christians when it is selectively interpreted to provide general education and train the mind, a Christian virtue. The article ends by calling for recovery of church education, that insists in the critical pursuit of God's truth in the modern age.
