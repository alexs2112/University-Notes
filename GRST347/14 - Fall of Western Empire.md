### Drama in the West
 - 476, September 4th: Deposition of Romulus Augustulus
	 - Augustulus: Small Augustus, very young boy
	 - The fall of Julius Nepos and the rise of Odoacer
 - Odoacer: Gothic general, had brought his people into the Roman Empire to fight as mercenaries
	 - The empire, under Julius Nepos, is unable to pay the mercenaries
	 - Odoacer revolts, raises a huge army, deposes Romulus Augustulus (and Julius Nepos ?)
	 - Sends letter to Zeno in the East to validate his control of the West as a King
 - Zeno says that Odoacer must submit the West to the empire in the East if he wants to be King
	 - Eastern Empire Zeno appointed Odoacer "magister militia per Italiam"
	 - Coin of Odoacer in profile, depicted with a "barbarian" haircut and moustache
		 - Is portraying himself clearly as himself, to be recognized as who he is
	 - Solidus (gold coins) of both Romulus Augustulus and Odoacer look exactly the same
		 - Zeno minted the coin of Odoacer, testifying formal submission of Odoacer to Zeno
		 - Zeno gave permission to Odoacer to mint his own coins
			 - Shows united empire with Zeno in control, Zeno > Odoacer

**Zeno: Emperor of the East**: (reigned 474-491)
 - Leo I: Last attempt to help the West (focused on Africa)
	 - Tried to help out, needed the money that the West can produce
	 - Two issues left to his successor:
		 - Threat posed by Goths in the Balkans
			 - Unsuccessfully waged war to retake the West
			 - Economic disaster, spent all their money on this war
		 - Council of Chalcedonia
			 - Huge split in Christianity
 - Leo II: Young son of Zeno, emperor for a few days (7 years old) and suddenly died
 - Zeno: An Isaurian general, had married Ariadne (daughter of Leo I), was very unpopular
	 - Gained power as first in line after the death of Leo II
	 - Extremely negative sources:
		 - Very unsuccessful military campaigns
		 - Economic issues of the empire (mostly left over from previous emperors)
		 - Had to fight a lot of internal conflict against his power, particularly in Constantinople
 - Basiliscus: Conspiracy (475-476)
 - Lots of religious issues
	 - Monophysitism vs Chalcedonianism
	 - Publication of the Henotikon in 482
		 - Collapsing the good relationships between East and West
		 - Makes everyone angry with him, pretends for religious equality, writes an edict that sneakily hates on one of them (not sure which)

**Monophysitism**:
 - *monos* (alone, solitary) and *physis* (nature)
 - Jesus Christ had only one nature, Divine
	 - Not an actual human
 - Predominant in the Eastern frontier regions, including Egypt and Syria

**Chalcedonianism**:
 - Council of Chalcedon, the Fourth Ecumenical Council held in 451
 - Christ had two natures (divine and human) in one person
 - Favoured in the West, and in Constantinople

### Byzantine
 - Controversial term, derived from the city Byzantine (site where Constantinople was built)
 - Term started appearing in 15th-16th century, only in 19th century became common in Western scholarship
	 - Term can be useful to highlight the changes happening the this area of the empire
 - Starts to refer to the Eastern Empire as the Byzantine Empire
	 - However, Eastern Roman Empire thought of themselves as fully Roman until the end
