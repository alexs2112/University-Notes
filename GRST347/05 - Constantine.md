### Constantine the Great
**Dissolution of the Tetrarchy and Fights** (305-313):
 - Diocletian retires and forces Maximian to do the same
	 - Likely due to health issues
 - The two Caesars become Augusti, new Caesars are nominated:
	 - Maximin Daia (East)
	 - Severus (West)
 - In this process they overlooked two men interested in power:
	 - Maxentius (Maximian's son) and Constantine (Constantius' son)
	 - They fight in the West, for the Battle of the Milvian Bridge
 - 311 - The Edict of Toleration by Galerius
 - When Constantine's father died, he was made emperor. Began calling himself Caesar, not Augustus

**Constantinus' Timeline**:
 - 306: Constantinus' father died
 - 308: He is named Caesar
 - 312: Battle of the Milvian Bridge
	 - Maxentius vs Constantine, the battle had reached Rome itself
		 - Imperial infighting
	 - Constantine had a dream, had his men draw the Chi Rho into their shields
		 - *In hoc signo vinces*: "In this sign, you will win"
	 - Dedicates his victory to Christianity
 - 313: Edict of Milan
	 - End of the persecutions of the Christians
	 - Many Christian writers extolling the virtues of Constantine
		 - Lactantius, followed by Eusebius
	 - pg. 118-119 in textbook
		 - Under the tetrarchy, all edicts were under "we"
			 - Now, it is under "I, Constantine Augustus" and "I, Licinius Augustus"
			 - Some scholars now argue that Licinius is in charge of these ideas, used to be anti-Christian
		 - Grants "freedom to follow whatever religion" to "Christians and to all men"
			 - Phrased to make the Christians very important
 - 324: Constantine defeats Licinius
 - 325: Council of Nicaea
 - 330: Constantinople
 - 337: Death

**Arch of Constantine** (312-315):
 - We don't even know when this was constructed
	 - Either to memorialize the Battle for the Milvian Bridge
	 - or had already started, and then taken over by Constantine after the battle
 - The arch is constructed using many different bits and pieces of previous structures
	 - Did they not have enough money? Is their craftsmenship worse?
 - Features scenes of Constantine giving a public speech
	 - He is the only one sitting
	 - Lots of propaganda to show that he is the strong emperor, Rome is coming back after the 3rd century crisis
		 - Tries to erase the previous empires in favour for Constantine

**Colossus of Constantine**:
 - Giant head still exists, positioned in a way such that while you walk around it is always looking at you
 - Exaggerated features, gigantic eyes, not a realistic depiction of the emperor
	 - Sending a message, the emperor is huge and watching everybody
 - Likely originally positioned at the end of a basilica, you would immediately see the giant statue as soon as you entered
### Constantine & Christianity
 - Known as the first Christian Roman Emperor
 - Explosion of Christianity after year 300
	 - Religious revolution of the 4th century
	 - Incredible determination of Christians to transform Constantine into a supporter -> protector -> eventual legislator of the Christian church
 - Reflection of the Christian faith of Constantine in his coinage
	 - As the value of coins are based on the metal they are comprised of, you can tell how prosperous the empire is based on the composition of their coins
	 - Debasement: Purity of the metal used in coins declines in times of recession
	 - We are now able to pinpoint what era certain coins came from based on their composition
 - Beardless emperor statue symbolizes Christian emperor after this period (Constantine was shaven)
 - Constantine had a vision of god before a big battle, told his soldiers to paint the cross on their shields, they then win the battle and the victory is attributed to god
	 - In the time prior to Constantine, Christianity was illegal, the symbols (the cross) were associated with Judaism
	 - The cross was a symbol of shame (crucified on the cross was a common execution)
		 - Likely was a different symbol painted on their shields, more likely the Chi Rho (symbolic of christ, sort of looks like a P layered with an X)
 - **Edict of Milan**: Constantine legalizes Christianity
	 - Major spiritual moment should have been visible on the coinage of the moment
 - **Sol Invictus**: Use of Sol's image (solar monotheism) was stressed on the coinage
	 - Constantine's status as his father's successor appealed to the educated citizens of Gaul
		 - Was considered less offensive than the traditional pagan pantheon to the Christians
	 - Shown and described as the companion of the sun god on a coin minted nearly four years after his conversion to Christianity
		 - Copies Sol's characteristic gesture of benediction seen on most bronze coins until 317
 - While Constantine's Christian vision took place in 312 and he built magnificent monuments to Christianity, his coins still reflected the pagan nature of Rome
	 - 323: Coins replaced by more religiously neutral coinage, such as "campgates", to symbolize the Empire being able to protect its citizens
 - Chi Rho appears first in coins, then eventually the cross (318)
	 - Did not openly create Christian coins, Christian mint workers took the opportunity to incorporate Christian symbols into the design of otherwise religiously ambiguous coins
	 - Reflects rise of Christian administrators to positions of authority in Constantine's regime, rather than official policy decision
 - Labarum was a vexillum (military standard) that displays a Chi-Rho flag
	 - Used rarely during Constantine's time, first used by him
	 - Flag suspended from the crossbar of a cross, symbolized the crucifixion of Christ
 - Heavenward Gaze: Coins with a bust with their "eyes to heaven"
	 - Constantine presumably looking heavenward in a devout, prayerful aspect
	 - Can't really prove it
		 - Already seen in some Roman coins, ultimately derived from Hellenistic portraits of Alexander the Great
 - Explicitly Christian iconography had yet to be developed by the end of Constantine's reign
	 - Less than 1% of the coins produced in this time are classified as having Christian symbols
	 - Early Christianity had developed illegally, visual manifestations of the new religion were safely ambiguous

### Constantinople, the New Rome
 - The "New Rome", but named after Constantine
 - Constantine left Rome, constantly visiting Byzantium
	 - Renewed first wall of city of Byzas, extended it and joined the two
	 - Renamed the city Constantinople
	 - Originally very small, but in a very good spot for trading and defense
 - Also completed the Hippodrome, adorned with bronze and riches to make it similar as the one in Rome
	 - Constructed a Palace and Forum, also similar to Rome
	 - Building a monumental city with all the aspects connected to power and propaganda
 - Trying to rebuild the idea of Rome

**Constantine I and Religion**:
 - He was *Pontifex Maximus*
	 - Head of the Roman religion
	 - No separation between the state and religion, a state cult
 - *Sol Invictus* "Unconquered Sun"
 - Constant intervention in Church's affairs
	 - 313-314: Church councils
	 - 325: Council of Nicaea - First ecumenical council of the Church
		 - Olkoumene -> the entire world -> ecumenical
 - Interest in building new churches
 - A shift that is clear but not immediate
