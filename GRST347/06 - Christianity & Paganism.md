### Religions in Late Antiquity
 - Constantine established Sunday as a day free from legal business
	 - Invented the weekend
 - Built many temples to Christianity

**St. Peter's Basilica in Rome**:
 - A space constructed for christians
 - People began building tombs and an entire necropolis below it
 - Only one that has been excavated is the alleged tomb of Peter
	 - Fight between multiple scholars if it really is his tomb

**Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre**:
 - Not limited to only building religious structure in Rome
 - In other places, he is building and pulling in pieces from everywhere else
 - In Jerusalem, he wants to construct a center of worship for christians
	 - Doesn't care about destroying older temples (Aphrodite)

**Helena, A New Empress**:
 - The mother of Constantine
	 - Reclamation of relics become closely associated with her
	 - Associated with Mary often
 - Erected two more temples (one at Bethlehem where Christ was born, and aon ridges of the Mount of Olives)
 - During residence at Jerusalem she assembled sacred virgins at a feast and performed services customary to those who wait upon guests

	 - Given authority over the imperial treasury to give it according to her judgement
 - Death at age of 80

### Religion in the Roman Empire
 - Issue with definition
 - Have to consider the spread of Judaism and Manicheanism throughout the empire
	 - Manicheanism spread from Persia all through the empire (West) and to China (East)
		 - Eventually everyone started persecuting them, particularly in Rome because it was converting Christians
 - Edict of toleration helped with allowing other new religions
![[Spread_of_Manicheanism.png|600]]

**Jews**:
 - Diaspora and persecutions by the Christians
 - Development of communities in the 3rd and 4th centuries

**Pagans**:
 - Becoming a minority
 - Cult permitted, usually in private
	 - Later forbidden

**Manicheans**:
 - Secretistic religion created by prophet Mani (mid-3rd century)
 - Elects and hearers
 - Secretive sect
 - Sacred books

**Christians**:
 - From persecutions to triumph
 - During 2nd century, Christians were mostly in the East and in main cities such as Carthage and Rome
 - They used Greek as their language
 - Certain larger houses are converted into churches (along with constructing new spaces)
	 - Open courtyards, assembly rooms, teaching areas, baptistery

### Christianity
 - Jesus of Nazareth was active during the rule of the emperor Tiberius (20 ca)
	 - We have various historical accounts: *Suetonius* and *Tacitus* in particular
 - Christians immediately differentiated themselves from the Jews
	 - Their message was universalistic
	 - Their savior had come to Earth
	 - The message of the resurrection
 - But Romans did not really distinguish them easily from the Jewish
	 - At least during the first period
	 - They thought of them as another sect of Judaism, not an entirely different religion

**Christianity and the Relationship with the Roman Empire**:
 - **Matthew 22:21** -  "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's"
	 - For the first time, idea of separating the religious sphere from political authority
 - **Romans 13:1** - "Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities"
	 - However this will lead to the refusal to perform the ritual sacrifice to the emperor
	 - This will be the easiest way to distinguish Christians

**Confusing Vocabulary of the Christians**:
 - *Kingdom-Laws-King*: Opposition between Heavenly kingdom and Earth power
	 - Romans felt probably threatened by this opposition
 - *Brother-Sister*: Romans thought the Christians were committing incest
 - *The Eucharistic Rituals*: Eating of the body and drinking the blood of Christ
	 - Romans thought the Christians were cannibals

**Pliny's Epistle to Trajan**: (112 CE)
 - Is in charge of charging people accused of being Christians (libel)
 - Asks them several times if they are Christians, becoming more threatening each time
	 - If they persevered in saying they were Christian, he would order them executed
		 - They are not respecting the state (not showing due to emperor or deities)
	 - Others would confess the first time, but then denied they currently were, saying they had ceased to be so many years ago
 - Eventually finds people that tells him what they do as part of their Christian practices
	 - Pliny thinks it is necessary to "inquire by torments" what the truth was
	 - Discovered that they weren't doing evil things besides having weird religion
 - Only danger is that many people of every age, rank, sexes are part of it
	 - Religion spread like a contagion, into cities, towns, and country villages
	 - Pliny realizes that Christianity is spreading incredibly quickly

**Trajan's Epistle to Pliny**:
 - Emperor answers that the rest of the people accused of Christianity are not to be sought for
 - However if they are accused and convicted then they are to be punished
 - If those deny themselves to be a Christian and makes it plain by supplicating the gods then they can be allowed pardon
 - Accusatory letters sent without an author will have no place in any accusation

### Christian Persecutions
 - Before the 3rd century, the persecutions were occasional
	 - 1st state persecution: 249-251
	 - 2nd state persecution: 253-260
	 - Part of the 3rd century crisis
 - Romans found subversive elements in their refusal to perform the normal state rituals
	 - Sacred Roman Tradition (*sacra-mores*)
 - Particularly threatening for a state that considered religion on a public, communal, and political level
	 - An excellent Roman citizen had to perform the rituals of the Roman Empire
 - Domitian's accusations concerning Christians:
	 - Accused them of being atheists
	 - They aren't sacrificing to their god, therefore they have no gods

**Attractiveness of Christianity**:
 - Based around concept of Agape (Christian love)
 - Open community
	 - No restrictions due to legal social, political status
	 - Women (in particular in the beginning) were welcomed and took active roles in the spreading of the religion
 - Charity: Monetary aid to widows, orphans, and marginalized individuals in general

**Martyrs = Witnesses**:
 - Witness of their faith by publicly refusing to deny it
	 - The martyrs became the heroes for the Christian's out there
 - Martyr's are witnessing their fate publicly and are refusing to denounce it

### The Passion of Perpetua and Felicity
**The Trial**:
 - Snatched away from a meal to be tried in the forum by procurator Hilarian
 - The others being asked at the trial confessed to be Christians
 - Her father showed up to try to get her to not confess to it
 - She also admitted to be a Christian, refusing her father (very abnormal in Rome)
	 - Father was about to cast down her faith to save her, was taken down and beat by a rod
	 - Christianity is changing society in a complex way, women started to stand up for themselves and not just be ordered around by men
 - Hilarian passed sentence to condemn them to the beasts, cheerfully they go to the dungeon
 - Sent her deacon to her father to get her child to breastfeed him in prison, father refused
	 - As God willed, no longer her child needed to be suckled

**The Premonitory Dream**:
 - Knew she was condemned to the beasts. Had a dream that instead of beasts, an ill-favored Egyptian came out to fight her (representation of the devil)
 - She stripped naked, became a man. Man = strong, woman = weak
 - Came forth a gigantic man (taller than the ampitheatre)
	 - Wearing a purple robe, shoes of gold and silver, wielding a rod like a master of gladiators, and a green branch with golden apples
 - The man claimed that if the Egyptian conquers the women, he will kill her. Otherwise, she will receive the branch
 - They fight, she crushes his head, goes up to the master of gladiators and received the branch
 - "Daughter, peace be with you", goes to the Gate of Life

**Felicity's Miracle**:
 - Felicity receives the grace of the lord
 - Was imprisoned for 8 months as she was pregnant when arrested
	 - Not allowed to be killed until she gives birth (pro life romans)
 - Becomes very sorrowful as the day of the games draws near
	 - She wanted to give birth asap so she could die with her community, not with strangers
	 - Did not want to be held back because of her pregnancy and then die among strangers
	 - Her fellow martyrs were also upset because they didn't want to leave behind their friend
 - They pray to their god 3 days before the games, after their prayer she feels pain and gives birth to a daughter
	 - Her sister raises her daughter as her own

### Church Hierarchies
 - Orthodoxy: correct/righteous opinion
 - Heresy: from *hairesis* - "chosen thing"/"choice
 - History of Christianity is also a history of heresies and the attitudes of the Church towards it
	 - In all religions that possess definite doctrine, there are differing opinions about that doctring. As a consequence, quarrels and conflict about it and social organization
 - Male celibate leadership and the new public body
	 - Separating themselves from the regular Roman society
	 - One of the main issues come with family, the Roman household is very stratified
		 - The father has power of life or death over all members of the house
		 - The house is the most important component of Roman society
	 - Don't want family ties, instead have ties to their community of many other people
 - Administrative structure of the church
	 - Ekklesia -> Assembly
	 - Episkopos -> Overseer
	 - Presbuteros -> Elder
	 - Diakonos -> Server
 - Most important centers for the church:
	 - Rome
	 - Carthage
	 - Alexandria
	 - Antioch
	 - Constantinople/Byzantium
