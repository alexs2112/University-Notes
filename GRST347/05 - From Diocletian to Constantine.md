### Diocletian
 - **Army**: From the legion to smaller troops (1000 men)

	 - 304: obligatory public sacrifices
	 - Book burnings, seizing of properties

**301: Edict on Maximum Prices**
 - Huge inflation on everything, prices through the roof
 - Diocletian attempts to define the price of every single thing in the empire
	 - Very detailed, wasn't really followed despite risk of capital penalty
 - 305: Finally revoked after years of failure

**Principate to the Dominate: A New Era in the Roman Empire**:
 - Dominate: The emperor is now officially a *dominus*, not a *princeps* (military leader)
	 - *Primus*: *Inter Pares*, first among equals
		 - Propaganda to make it seem as though the emperor is working together with the senate, not just doing things that they want to do
	 - *Dominus*: Lord/Owner
 - Crown and Mantle: Changing how the emperors appear, now dressed as the visible ruler of Rome
 - Prostration and Kiss of the Cloak: Must kneel before the emperor and kiss their cloak
	 - Previously, kneeling was considered as bad form
 - The Standing Council: The only one sitting in a thrown is the emperor, the rest of the council must stand

### Constantine & Christianity
 - Known as the first Christian Roman Emperor
 - Explosion of Christianity after year 300
	 - Religious revolution of the 4th century
	 - Incredible determination of Christians to transform Constantine into a supporter -> protector -> eventual legislator of the Christian church
 - Reflection of the Christian faith of Constantine in his coinage
	 - As the value of coins are based on the metal they are comprised of, you can tell how prosperous the empire is based on the composition of their coins
	 - Debasement: Purity of the metal used in coins declines in times of recession
	 - We are now able to pinpoint what era certain coins came from based on their composition
 - Beardless emperor statue symbolizes Christian emperor after this period (Constantine was shaven)
 - Constantine had a vision of god before a big battle, told his soldiers to paint the cross on their shields, they then win the battle and the victory is attributed to god
	 - In the time prior to Constantine, Christianity was illegal, the symbols (the cross) were associated with Judaism
	 - The cross was a symbol of shame (crucified on the cross was a common execution)
		 - Likely was a different symbol painted on their shields, more likely the Chi Rho (symbolic of christ, sort of looks like a P layered with an X)
 - **Edict of Milan**: Constantine legalizes Christianity
	 - Major spiritual moment should have been visible on the coinage of the moment
 - **Sol Invictus**: Use of Sol's image (solar monotheism) was stressed on the coinage
	 - Constantine's status as his father's successor appealed to the educated citizens of Gaul
		 - Was considered less offensive than the traditional pagan pantheon to the Christians
	 - Shown and described as the [todo]
 - While Constantine's Christian vision took place in 312 and he built magnificent monuments to Christianity, his coins still reflected the pagan nature of Rome
	 - 323: Coins replaced by more religiously neutral coinage, such as "campgates", to symbolize the Empire being able to protect its citizens
 - Chi Rho appears first in coins, then eventually the cross (318)
	 - Did not openly create Christian coins, Christian mint workers took the opportunity to incorporate Christian symbols into the design of otherwise religiously ambiguous coins
	 - Reflects rise of Christian administrators to positions of authority in Constantine's regime, rather than official policy decision
 - Labarum was a vexillum (military standard) that displays a Chi-Rho flag
	 - Used rarely during Constantine's time, first used by him
	 - Flag suspended from the crossbar of a cross, symbolized the crucifixion of Christ
 - Heavenward Gaze: Coins with a bust with their "eyes to heaven"
	 - Constantine presumably looking heavenward in a devout, prayerful aspect
	 - Can't really prove it
		 - Already seen in some Roman coins, ultimately derived from Hellenistic portraits of Alexander the Great
 - Explicitly Christian iconography had yet to be developed by the end of Constantine's reign
	 - Less than 1% of the coins produced in this time are classified as having Christian symbols
	 - Early Christianity had developed illegally, visual manifestations of the new religion were safely ambiguous
