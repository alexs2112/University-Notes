### Political Situation
 - 5th and 6th centuries are a period of intense transformations
 - The Roman Empire: Divided *de facto* (operating differently, different issues), not *de iure*
	 - Legal and constitutional unity until the 6th century
		 - Tried to portray themselves as a united single empire, instead the East and West were rapidly splitting apart
		 - East is claiming they still own the West, even though they don't even have an emperor anymore
	 - Different issues and administrations, legally they were still operating under the same laws
 - Imperial families become more critical
	 - New active role for women, present in the court and government
 - Relocation of emperors to their capitals reduced their ability to intervene directly in local and regional matters
	 - East: Imperial system of administration and bureaucracy proved highly effective
	 - West: Military matters had priority, administration was failing, no ability to gather taxes
	 - Previous major cities (like Alexandria) became less important as emperors began focusing on only the capitals

### Theodosian Code of Laws
 - Handbook of Roman public laws from Constantine onwards
	 - Collection of laws from all over the empire (the empire was one)
	 - Not universal, some regional laws that were never ratified elsewhere
 - Completed in 437 in Constantinople
	 - 438: Presented to the Roman senate
 - Practical guidance to local magistrates and judges
 - Ornate and rhetorical Latin, laws drawn from both Western and Eastern Empire
	 - All written in Latin, up until Justinian (then some Greek)
 - Everything about this shows one united empire

### Theodosius II
 - Primary sources mostly depict the emperor negatively
	 - Our primary sources for this period of time are problematic on their own
	 - The 4th century was rich in sources, now we are reverting to flip-flopping between the value of sources
 - Tensions and power struggles at court, a new reality of power
	 - Leads to female participation in power
		 - Lots of struggles and fights
	 - Portray him as a weak emperor because he listens to women
 - Caution and not inertia in the foreign policy
	 - Never particularly active at war or running the empire
	 - After the death of Attila, the threat of the Huns fell apart

### Pulcheria II
 - Sister of Theodosius II (one of three sisters)
 - The true empress of the imperial court
 - Had a role in the marriage of Theodosius II
 - "Our Lord Theodosius, pious and fortunate Augustus, Emperor and most mighty triumphant conqueror of barbarian races, eternal, and universal victor, *in accordance with the prayers of his sisters*, rejoice on high"
	 - He did not have much of an active role in conquering the Huns
	 - All of these achievements related to his sisters
 - Sozomen, Historia Ecclesiastica, on Pulcheria:
	 - "They all pursue the same mode of life; they are sedulous in their attendance in the house of prayer, and evince great charity towards strangers and the poor... and pass their days and their nights together in singing the praises of God"
		 - Led a bit of a double life; devoted herself to virginity and God doing nothing but praying and attending church, but also created a lot of works of charity around Constantinople
	 - "She devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters to do likewise. To avoid cause of scandal and opportunities for intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her resolution she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses"
		 - Negative source that this was all a bit of a sham in order to gain success and respect
 - When forced to marry, she married Marcian
 - Trier Ivory, representing a procession with royal figures theorized to depict Theodosius II and Pulcheria
	 - Contains a church funded by Pulcheria in Constantinople

### East
**Galla Placidia**:
 - Sister of Arcadius and Honorius
 - She was immediately used by her brother for a marriage alliance
	 - 1st marriage to Ataulph (new leader of Visigoths, taking place of Alaric)
		 - Try to create a marriage alliance between the Empire and the Barbarian Kingdoms
		 - This will go very bad, only lasts 1-2 years before divorce (bad relations between the Empire and the Visigoths)
	 - 2nd marriage to Constantius III
 - All of these family lines between East and West are united
 - Cross-shaped mausoleum in Ravenna (Italy)
	 - Full of Christian and imperial art
	 - Created for herself and close family members
	 - Every wing of the tomb has different styles of artwork
	 - "The pious intellect of Galla Placidia rejoices of the decorum of the paternal work, in all the splendour due to the care of Pope Leo"
 - Short discussion about imperial art of the time
	 - Martyrdom of St. Laurent artwork is meant to depict the heavens and stars
		 - Books of manuscripts look to be on fire
		 - These "flames" are actually pieces of cloth used to sign the pages of the books
 - Galla Placidia's second marriage with Constantius III created a line for the throne
	 - Constantius was general of the Roman army (fundamental roles taken by generals again)
	 - New line for the throne: Honoria and Valentinian III
 - 421: Constantius becomes Augustus
	 - We don't consider him as an actual emperor
	 - Certain roles of the court are so important they are basically co-emperors
 - 423: Honorius Death
	 - Constantius was supposed to take power, but he died alread
 - 425: Usurpation of John, Theodosius II takes situation in hand, puts Valentinian III on throne
	 - John was an important council member, no real line of emperors, easily takes over East
	 - Galla Placidia hires Theodosius to take out John
	 - Valentinian III is still a child, Galla is the functional emperor
 - Flavius Aetius and the Hunnic threat in Italy
	 - Attila had moved North, then South again to Italy to pose a direct threat
	 - Galla Placidia found some money, gave a ton of gold to Attila to make them back off

### The Crisis of the Western Roman Empire
 - Aetius and Valentinian III: A child in power along with his general
	 - Situation escalated, Aetius killed by Valentinian (weak leader jealous of strong leader)
	 - Valentinian III killed by some supporters of Aetius
 - 455: Emperor appointed a senator Petonius Maximus
	 - Man external from the family line, Valentinian didn't have children
 - Married the widow of Valentinian (forced to keep the family line alive)
 - Conflict with Geiseric, Vandal King
	 - Roman Emperor had promised, before becoming Emperor, his daughter to son of Geiseric
	 - Did not think it would be wise to have this family relation now that he is Emperor
		 - Would make Geiseric next in line to be emperor
	 - Cut the deal, Geiseric became angry
	 - Sent a fleet to Italy and sacked Rome
 - 455: Sack of Rome by the Vandals, 14 days of plundering
	 - This time it is a huge deal
 - Between 440-480, the politics of the Empire depended on an elaborate balance of power between the Western Court in Rome, the Huns in Illyricum, the Eastern Emperor of Constantinople, and the Vandals in Carthage
 - Story of is ruin is simple and obvious, instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted for so long
	 - Victorious legions acquired vices of strangers and mercenaries from distant wars
	 - Oppressed the freedom of the republic, later violated the majesty of the purple
	 - The emperors, anxious for personal safety and peace, reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline, rendering them alike formidable to their sovereign and enemy
	 - Vigour of the military government was relaxed, and finally dissolved by the partial institutions of Constantine
	 - And the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians

### East (450-491)
 - *Interregnum*: Pulcheria as sole empress (one month in 450)
	 - She keeps power for a little over one month
 - Marcian (451-457): Thracian military officer
	 - Low taxes as the Hunnic threat evaporated
		 - Treasury in Constantinople had grown significantly
	 - Supported by Pulcheria, compromised by losing her virgin christian status in order to create a strong bloodline that her brother had failed to do.
	 - Died in 457
 - Leo (457-474): Another senior military figure
	 - First coronation in which the Patriarch of Constantinople played a role
