### Late Antiquity
 - AKA: Later Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire
	 - Periodization issues, no clearly defined and agreed upon changes in periods
 - Edward Gibbon: *History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* (1776-1788)
	 - First to specifically look at the fall of the Roman Empire, tried to investigate why
	 - Rationalism: Christianity was the reason for the fall
 - Karl Marx and Marxist historians:
	 - States based on extreme inequalities are destined to fall eventually
	 - Slavery, lots of economic inequality
 - Michael Rostovtzeff:
	 - Later Empire was just a "degeneration and decline" of an earlier prosperous Empire
		 - Particularly under the Antonines
	 - Totalitarianism was the main cause for the decline

**Thematic approaches:**
 - Instead of following main historical events (emperor's gaining power, military exploits) they consider underlying themes of the Roman Empire
 - A. H. M. Jones: *The Later Roman Empire* (1964)
	 - Linked decline with degeneration of political structure of the Empire
 - Peter Brown: *The World of Late Antiquity* (1971)
	 - Changes approach, doesn't care that much about Emperors, political change, economy
	 - Instead looks at cultural shifts of the Empire as a whole, not specifically east and west
 - Averil Cameron: *The Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity* (1993)
	 - Also approaches the collapse differently, needs to move away from the terms "degeneration", "decline", and "fall"
	 - Focuses on the important positive parts of the collapse
### Primary Sources
 - Source material is rich and wide for this period
	 - Written documents: Latin & Greek tradition
	 - Archaeological evidence
	 - Art & Architecture
 - Issues with reconstructing daily life and ordinary people
	 - Christian dominant writings, not many pagan sources survived
