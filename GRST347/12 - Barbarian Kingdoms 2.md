### The Sack of Rome
 - 410, Visigoths led by Alaric
 - Jerome, Christian author, was in Jerusalem when he heard news about the sack of Rome
	 - Writes letter about the event
	 - Rome was besieged, citizens were buying their freedom with gold
	 - The city that has conquered the world has been conquered
		 - Could not take as many prisoners because everyone was already dead
 - p. 56, 2.6.1 author, idk who
	 - Alaric gave orders that those who had taken refuge in sacred spaces, such as basilicas, would remain unharmed
	 - Outside of numbers, most other people in empire talked as though nothing had happened
		 - Dichotomy between Jerome's account (everything sucks) and this account (whatever)

**Political Situation in the Empire at the end of 410**:
[todo]

### Barbarian Pressure
 - Eastern Rome: Everything was pretty much normal
 - Western Rome: Everything went to shit because of the barbarians
	 - Loses most of northern Africa, the wealthiest province of the west
	 - Could no longer sustain the army after losing all of those taxes

**The Huns**:
 - Origins: Scholars argue a lot
	 - Sources consider the Huns as the ones that displaced all of the other people in the area
	 - Scholars don't want to say that this was the only issue that displaced everyone
		 - Economy, agriculture, etc
	 - Moved and settled in Northern Rome, previously nomadic people, now moving less
 - Ammianus Marcellinus perspective, contact with the Romans (p.371-373):
	 - Wrote an extensive ethnographic paper on the Huns
	 - Describe them as monsters, not humans. Terrified of them, cannot reason with them or defeat them in combat
	 - "Compact, strong limbs and thick necks, and are so monstrously ugly and misshapen"
		 - Also huge and violent
	 - Used to their hardy mode of life, no need of fire or savory food
	 - Never protected by buildings, roaming in the mountains and woods, don't enter houses
		 - Already changed by the time of Attila
	 - Deliberate as a common body, no loyal restraint, disorderly government
		 - They fight and force their way through every obstacle
	 - When they are provoked, they fight in wedge-shaped masses while screaming
		 - Lightly equipped for swift motion, divide into scattered bands and attack
		 - Creating disorder, terrific slaughter, very rapid so never attack ramparts or pillage
		 - Fight from a distance with bone projectiles, then ride over and fight with swords and lassos
	 - They do not farm, do not have settled life, and keep roaming with wagons
	 - In truces, they are faithless and unreliable, sway to motions of every breeze of new hope
		 - "Utterly ignorant of the difference between right and wrong"
	 - Inhuman desire for plundering property, violent way of rape and slaughter

**Eastern Response**:
 - A new wall around Constantinople (413)
 - Strengthen the Danube frontier (412)
	 - Put a whole fleet on the river, weak area that people were bound to enter
 - Money payments to maintain deals with barbarians
	 - Cheaper than having to maintain their own army

**Western Response**:
 - General Aetius (390-454) used them to control Germanic people
	 - Against the Visigoths (425, 430, 436)
	 - Against the Franks (432)
	 - Against the Burgundians (436-37)
	 - Cooled down the pressure of these other barbarian groups
 - At a certain point, they also started losing taxes from Africa

**Other Events**:
 - 435: Joint leadership of two brothers
	 - Practically able to unite various tribes and clans of the Huns under their own leadership
	 - Attila & Bleda
 - Change of strategy due to the success of the vandals
 - Wanted to keep the same treaties, they are paid by the Romans to leave them along
	 - Eventually the West runs out of money
 - 439: Treaty with Constantinople
	 - No more fugitives, escapees of the Huns who would enter Rome
		 - Eastern Empire would have to return these people to the Huns immediately (killed)
	 - Huge market ransoming expensive important Roman prisoners
		 - Tried to capture soldiers, generals, etc
		 - Eastern Empire would usually try to bring back their citizens
	 - Romans could not help other tribes against the Huns
		 - This is the strategy that the Romans had, divide and conquer
	 - Annual sum of 700 pounds of gold to the Huns to keep the peace ($17.5m USD)

**Huns and Trade**:
 - Frontier trading posts
	 - Huge trading market between the Huns and Romans
	 - Practically protected grounds of both societies
 - What did the Huns offer?
	 - Horses, skins, furs, a ton of slaves (they captured as many people as they could in war)
 - What did the Huns buy?
	 - Luxuries: Clothing, jewelry, spices
	 - They were not used to these things culturally
	 - Romans giving away a ton of gold to the Huns every year, but made it back from trade
