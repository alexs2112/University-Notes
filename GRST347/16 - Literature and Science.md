### Legal Writings: Codex of Justinian (Corpus Iuris Civilis)
 - Written between 529-534 by a team of jurists led by Tribonian
	 - Written in Latin
	 - Two different editions, the first one is lost to us
 - Different than Theodosian Code
 - Is a massive collection, fundamental resource for modern day scholars
 - Codex: Partly written by Justinian, a textbook for jurists
	 - Gloss - Marginal notation regarding main text in a document (notes written in the margin)
	 - Important for university life for jurists in medieval times

### Philosophy
 - *Philosophy* (philos + sophia): "Love of Wisdom"
 - Athens and Alexandria were hubs of philosophical learning
	 - Alexandria: Huge center of knowledge
 - 529 CE: Justinian orders the schools of philosophy in Athens to shut down
	 - John Malalas, "Chronicle", 18.47
	 - Philosophical schools were the last remaining resistance to Christianity
		 - Went contrary to what the Church was trying to achieve

**Plotinus** (205-270 CE)
 - A successful philosopher
 - A life of travels: Born in Egypt, student in Alexandria, teaching in Rome
 - Taught Porphyry of Tyre, other vastly important philosopher
 - Renewal of interest in Plato's philosophy
	 - 11.1.1 The One (p. 311-312)
	 - Unity of power and people, could be interpreted as the Christian god
		 - Threatening Christianity, but could be interpreted as supporting it
 - Christian thinkers and Neoplatonism: Syncretism
	 - 11.1.12 (p.324)

**Literary Culture: Scroll to the Codex**
 - Before the codex, we had papyrus scrolls (thinly dried strips of papyrus plant)
	 - Expensive, delicate, and awkward to use
	 - Didn't want to just raw write out the final copy onto the scroll, would use wax tablets
 - Wax tablet: Little blocks of wax, would draft writing by carving then out of the wax using a stylus
	 - A lawyer or notary would edit and write this down into proper forms
 - Membranae: Booklet made of parchment (animal skin)
	 - Extremely expensive, but much more resistant for preservation
	 - At a certain part they begin to use these booklets a lot more (starts with pagan poetry)
 - Codex: Entirety of the book of laws
	 - This is what we see entirely in late antiquity and middle ages until paper is made
 - Only the wealthiest individuals could pay people to write books
	 - Paid for books so that they could appear in portraits in the books themselves
		 - Portrait of Anicia Juliana (461-527), incredibly wealthy aristocrat in Constantinople
			 - Flanked by Megalopsychia (Greatness of Spirit) and Phronesis (Good Sense)
			 - With a big section about how good she is as a person
	 - Mostly for personal use or recording information for posterity
	 - Poets would bring a copy of their poetry along with some copiers, if they like your poetry they pay you and you make a whole bunch of copies for them

**Proba and her Cento, the Mash-Up Poem**:
 - Faltonia Proba: Another woman author, first woman in entire antiquity to write an entire work of poetry (that we know of), 6th century CE
	 - Set aside for a long time because she wrote a cento
 - Cento: A patchwork, created a new poem out of a lot of old verses from other poems
	 - Make a tragic poem using only verses from other tragedies
	 - Most scholars at this time hate it, despite high degree of artistry and experimentation
 - Uses Vergil's verses to compose the life of Jesus
 - A political statement:
	 - "By appropriating these ideas for her life of Jesus, Proba showed her readers that being a Christian in the 4th century Rome was entirely consistent with centuries of traditional Roman values" Boin (2018, 212)
		 - Work to describe famous women from history
		 - Says Proba is one of the most important artist women of history

**Languages: No Only Greek and Latin**:
 - Began writing in other languages (Germanic languages) to become more approachable
 - Sidonius Apollinaris: Gaul moved to Rome, we have lots of angry letters from him
	 - Sent letters to family and friends back in Gaul, gets angrier as he never gets a reply
	 - 13.1.9 (p.352-353)

### Medicine
 - Doctors are expensive, if you don't have money to pay for doctors you were fucked
	 - Also in an age where people don't understand basic hygiene and bacteria (eg. plague)
 - Hippocrates and the Humours: Great Greek doctor of 3rd century BCE, very influential
	 - Humours: Each person has 4 elements (humours) that need to be in balance
	 - Illness is caused by an imbalance of these humours
	 - The doctors will determine which one is imbalanced, and to take care of it
 - Galen
 - Late Antiquity: Doctors, Healers, Priests
	 - Priests became the main doctors during Christianity to perform Exorcisms
 - Women: Huge amount of female doctors in Rome
	 - Not a lot of written sources by the women, but lots of inscriptions and artwork of them
	 - Healthcare training was passed through generations, household doctors
	 - Women took care of other women
	 - Once healthcare came to the universities, women were excluded again

**The Plague: Literary Approach**
 - Surgeries were performed during this time, Romans were good surgeons
	 - Archaeological evidence of surgical books, similar instruments to modern tools
 - p. 307-309
