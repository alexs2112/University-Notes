 - Notes on Cerula
	 - Sign above her head is last and first letter in alphabet, symbolize Christ
	 - Hands in gesture of prayer
	 - The books are burning
	 - The two are early women bishops, only ones depicted in Christian artwork as praying

**Mothers, Virgins, and Widows**:
 - Jerome XXII to Eustochium:
	 - "While I receive marriage as a thing in itself admissible, I yet prefer continence, widowhood, and virginity"
	 - No love marriage in Roman antiquity, they were for alliances. You could freely divorce and marry someone else if you needed to change the alliance
	 - Once more, Christianity is disrupting social norms of Roman society
		 - Daughters no longer wanted to be married, wanted virginity and continence
 - Other textbook examples:
	 - Daughters of Eve (p. 235)
	 - Paula (p. 148)
	 - Olympias (p. 227)
 - Augustine of Hippo
	 - Augustine's conversion
	 - The *Confessions*: exciting depiction of life in late Antiquity
		 - First person perspective of her ascending past Earth and into heaven (vision)
		 - "Life in the wisdom by which all creatures came into being, both things which were and which will be"
	 - Mother & Son: Shared vision of God
		 - Trying to convince her son to convert to Christianity

### Rise of Monasticism
 - New living arrangements
 - Sexuality as a negative symptom of societal problems
 - Different experiences between East and West
 - Ascetism: From *askesis* (exercise)
 - Other important words of this period:
	 - Monk from *monachos* (lonely one), leaving society behind
	 - Anchorite from *anachoreo* (to go away, to withdraw)
	 - Eremos (of the desert)
	 - Stylite (pillar-dweller), don't fully leave society, alone in ascetic exercise in city
	 - Cenobitic (common life), community lifestyle, monks sharing their lives with other monks

**Athansius, *Life of Antony***:
 - Devil could not bear seeing purpose in youth, set to work against this person as well
	 - Devil hates monks, attempts to lead them away from their discipline
 - Provides memories of possessions, guardianship of his sister, bonds of kinship, love of money and glory, pleasures of food, relaxations of life, rigor of virtue and the labor that earns it
 - Antony attempted to cordon off the devil from his righteous intentions
	 - Devil saw his own weakness and that he would lose against Antony
	 - Overturned by great faith and Antony's constant prayers

**Stylites - Pillar-Dwellers**:
 - Pillar structures built outside of the city, monks would sit on top and meditate or preach to the people gathered below
 - Simeon was a very famous one, after being a monk for a long time he went and dug himself a hole in the garden (up to his chest) and stood in it for 2 years
	 - Other monks were jealous, had abbot try to have him mingle with other monks
	 - After that he set up a large pillar and stood on it for 5 years, became famous, people came to seek him out

### Sexuality & Extreme Asceticism
 **153 Canons of the Council of Gangra**:
 - Basically, if anyone condemns the following things, let them be anathema (bad)
 - 1. Marriage is good; do not condemn marriage or tell a woman who sleeps with her husband that she will not enter heaven
 - 2. Cooked meat; Do not condemn someone who eats cooked meat that has not been offered to idols
 - 3. Slaves are good; Do not teach a slave to despise his master and run away
 - 9. Fake Virginity; Do not remain a virgin or abstain from beauty because you abhor it (instead of on account of the beauty and holiness of virginity itself)
 - 10. Virgin Arrogance; If you are a virgin for the Lord's sake, do not be arrogant to the married
 - 13. Women Clothes; Women should not change into men's clothes under pretense of asceticism

**John Cassianus and the Monastic Rule**:
 - Monk robes should be purely for covering the body and keep them from the cold
	 - Not become the seed of vanity and pride
 - Apostle: "Having food and covering, with these let us be content"
	 - "Covering", not "raiment", something that may merely cover the body
 - The robes should be free from anxious carefulness, yet not discoloured by stains acquired by neglect
 - Let them be removed from this world's fashions, remain altogether *common property* for the use of the servants of God
	 - If someone claims something instead of common property for all of the monks, they must be superfluous or vain (harmful, vanity vs virtue)
	 - You don't own anything, the community owns everything, even your clothes
 - Upon admission, they are stripped of all former possessions, no longer allowed to keep even the clothes on their back
	 - In the council of the monks, brought forward and stripped of clothes, then redressed by the abbot in the robes of the monastery
	 - Ensuring he has given up his objects and laid aside all *worldly pride*
	 - Come down to the want and poverty of Christ
 - Supported no longer by wealth, his rations are received out of the holy and sacred funds of the monastery as payment for his service
