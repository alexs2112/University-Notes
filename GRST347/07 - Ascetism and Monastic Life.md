**Mothers, Virgins, and Widows**:
 - Jerome XXII to Eustochium:
	 - "While I receive marriage as a thing in itself admissible, I yet prefer continence, widowhood, and virginity"
	 - No love marriage in Roman antiquity, they were for alliances. You could freely divorce and marry someone else if you needed to change the alliance
	 - Once more, Christianity is disrupting social norms of Roman society
		 - Daughters no longer wanted to be married, wanted virginity and continence
 - Other textbook examples:
	 - Daughters of Eve (p. 235)
	 - Paula (p. 148)
	 - Olympias (p. 227)

### Rise of Monasticism
 - New living arrangements

 - Different experiences between East and West
 - Ascetism: From *askesis* (exercise)
 - Other important words of this period:
	 - Monk from *monachos* (lonely one), leaving society behind
	 - Anchorite from *anachoreo* (to go away, to withdraw)
	 - Eremos (of the desert)
	 - Stylite (pillar-dweller), don't fully leave society, alone in ascetic exercise in city
	 - Cenobitic (common life), community lifestyle, monks sharing their lives with other monks

**Athansius, *Life of Antony***:
 - Devil could not bear seeing purpose in youth, set to work against this person as well
	 - Devil hates monks, attempts to lead them away from their discipline
 - Provides memories of possessions, guardianship of his sister, bonds of kinship, love of money and glory, pleasures of food, relaxations of life, rigor of virtue and the labor that earns it
 - Antony attempted to cordon off the devil from his righteous intentions
	 - Devil saw his own weakness and that he would lose against Antony
	 - Overturned by great faith and Antony's constant prayers
