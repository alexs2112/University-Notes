### Roman State Organization
**Ideology of Rulership**:
 - Officials were only present for things to go smoothly

**Taxes**:
 - Two biggest expenses for the Roman Empire: Army & Annona
 - Iugatio-capitatio: As a subject of the empire, you must provide services (military, infrastructure)
	 - Taxation system that converts services into money owed to the empire
 - Census (indiction): Established that the census is done every 50 years (indiction period)
	 - Previously this was much more frequently, every 5ish years
	 - Now they keep track of which indiction period they are in
	 - Assess each city in the empire to see how they are doing and how much they could provide to the state via taxes
 - Annona Militaris and Civilis
	 - Annona: System of providing resources to people who could not afford them
	 - Every year, the Roman state would buy grain and subsidize it for the people of Rome
		 - Buy it for much cheaper than regular people would be able to
		 - Was just for Rome, when Constantinople was created the annona was now twice as expensive to provide for two capitals

**System of Justice**: Incredibly complex legal system
 - People would have to appeal up the ladder to the emperor himself to assess the situation
 - The system worked with the idea that all officials were judges on cases
	 - Smaller officials would solve problems if they could, if not they would send it upwards
 - Some scholars think that political decisions in Rome were actually made passively
	 - Sometimes the Emperor does make laws to fix small things
	 - Most of the time officials would just solve things on their own on the emperor's behalf

**Communication Systems**:
 - The state could not function without a good communication system
 - Large focus on harbor and ship-building
	 - Send communications over sea instead of using the roads
 - The army needs to efficiently receive communication on orders
 - Court officials are constantly moving, letters are constantly being sent to different officials
	 - The letters need to be able to quickly find their recipients
 - Roads: Still fundamental to rapid communication
 - Mansiones: Houses at points in the road for travellers to rest and prepare for the rest of their journey
	 - Sometimes very small, 20-30 meters with some rooms and posts for horses
	 - Can change horses, brief stop, pay, leave your horse, take a new horse and continue
	 - Needed to be safe for travellers, everything can be completely locked down
	 - Ancient motel

**Bureaucracy**: A complex administrative machine
 - Administrators needed to be able to understand both Latin & Greek
	 - Had to take test before assuming office

### Barbarians
 - Barbarian -> People who could not speak Greek -> Could not speak Latin
	 - Defines Greeks vs Others

**Germanic People**:
 - Nucleated villages:
	 - Small agricultural villages (< 200 people)
	 - Central cluster of houses surrounded by land
	 - Sharing tools and labour
 - By 4th/5th larger units -> kingdoms -> dux -> rex
	 - Dux, Rex titles given by emperors, they legitimize the area taken by the barbarians
 - Started coming south from Germany, began displacing many people (particularly Celtic people)
	 - Moved in search of better agricultural land to work with

**Encounter between Romans and Germanic People**:
 - From 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE:
	 - Population growth
	 - Nomadic people from Asia
 - Fluid social structure:
	 - Clan/extended family
	 - Military Chieftains
	 - Tribes (Tribus)
 - By 4th/5th century, larger units turned into Kingdoms
 - Society was now very different than the agricultural one they started with
	 - Previously were fully agriculture, building everything out of wood
		 - Does not leave good archaeological remains
 - Have to rely on Roman sources of the Germans

**Customs of Germanic People**:
 - *Wergeld*: "Man-money"
	 - Customary codes
	 - Justice done through payment of a fine
	 - Everything has a price, if you kill someone then you owe family members that value
 - War and violence, a meritocratic system of sort
	 - Very violent people, not only because they had to fight the Romans
		 - Needed to constantly expand territory and protect themselves
	 - They were in clans and tribes, lots of fighting against each other
		 - Main weakness compared to the Roman empire
	 - Germans were huge compared to the Romans
		 - Roman helms had very tall plumages to appear bigger and scare opponents
		 - Germans did not have any helmets, their hair was dyed and wild
 - *Mundium*: Protective ownership of women
	 - Class system, women never able to increase their class while men can move up
	 - A way to keep women safe as society was very violent
 - Religion: From polytheism to Arianism (Ulfilas 383)
	 - Previous: Gods were everywhere in nature
	 - Arianism: Christian sect completely cut off after council of Nicaea
		 - Arianism = Aryanism, eventual Nazi ideology
		 - Arianism started becoming very big, bishop converted a huge number of people
	 - Created the Gothic alphabet in order to write down and translate the Christian texts
	 - Portray their gods as bearded, different clothing than Romans with different weapons
		 - This is seen in sarcophagus carving, looks like a pile of bodies
		 - Roman gods (shaven) vs Germanic gods
		 - This shows they weren't fighting with the same types of techniques or weaponry
			 - Germanic -> Heavy cavalry
			 - Roman -> Heavy infantry

**Germanic People Artifacts**:
 - Most of their stuff does not preserve and is lost to time
 - We do have a series of jewelry that has been preserved
	 - A new way of working with gold and coloured glass
	 - Usually bronze item coated in gold, with a mix of coloured glass and precious stones
 - Their hairstyles were important to them. An uncovered bog body with a perfect hairstyle
	 - Suebian knot hairstyle, common among Germanic warriors
	 - Dying hair was fairly common as well
### Death of Theodosius
 - Theodosius died in 395, leaving very young emperors in control of the empire
	 - Honorius (West, 8 yo), Arcadius (East, late teens)
	 - Figurehead emperors to show united Rome and united politics
 - This is the beginning of the two halves of the empire completely separating
	 - Different problems and different politics with useless emperors

**Flavius Stilicho**:
 - General, essentially a tutor to Honorius
	 - Goths ravaging Greece, started to pose a threat to Constantinople
 - Essentially became enraged at the praetors of Constantinople
	 - Goes back to the West, abandoning the East

**Alaric, Leader of the Visigoths**:
 - Was doing whatever he wanted in the East, destroying and raiding whatever he wanted
 - Was not getting what he wanted from Constantinople
	 - Also threatened by the huns building up in the region
	 - Decided to move West and begins to take over lots of land in Italy
 - Stilicho gets killed as Honorius makes some poor decisions
	 - Honorius lives in Ravenna for protection, good communication between West and East
 - Alaric gets free reign, he moves directly to Rome and sacks it (410)
	 - Not really the capital of the empire anymore anyways
