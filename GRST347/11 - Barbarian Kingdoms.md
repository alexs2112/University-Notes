### Roman State Organization
**Ideology of Rulership**:
 - Officials were only present for things to go smoothly

**Taxes**:
 - Two biggest expenses for the Roman Empire: Army & Annona
 - Iugatio-capitatio: As a subject of the empire, you must provide services (military, infrastructure)
	 - Taxation system that converts services into money owed to the empire
 - Census (indiction): Established that the census is done every 50 years (indiction period)
	 - Previously this was much more frequently, every 5ish years
	 - Now they keep track of which indiction period they are in
	 - Assess each city in the empire to see how they are doing and how much they could provide to the state via taxes
 - Annona Militaris and Civilis
	 - Annona: System of providing resources to people who could not afford them
	 - Every year, the Roman state would buy grain and subsidize it for the people of Rome
		 - Buy it for much cheaper than regular people would be able to
		 - Was just for Rome, when Constantinople was created the annona was now twice as expensive to provide for two capitals

**System of Justice**: Incredibly complex legal system
 - People would have to appeal up the ladder to the emperor himself to assess the situation
 - The system worked with the idea that all officials were judges on cases
	 - Smaller officials would solve problems if they could, if not they would send it upwards
 - Some scholars think that political decisions in Rome were actually made passively
	 - Sometimes the Emperor does make laws to fix small things
	 - Most of the time officials would just solve things on their own on the emperor's behalf

**Communication Systems**:
 - The state could not function without a good communication system
 - Large focus on harbor and ship-building
	 - Send communications over sea instead of using the roads
 - The army needs to efficiently receive communication on orders
 - Court officials are constantly moving, letters are constantly being sent to different officials
	 - The letters need to be able to quickly find their recipients
 - Roads: Still fundamental to rapid communication
 - Mansiones: Houses at points in the road for travellers to rest and prepare for the rest of their journey
	 - Sometimes very small, 20-30 meters with some rooms and posts for horses
	 - Can change horses, brief stop, pay, leave your horse, take a new horse and continue
	 - Needed to be safe for travellers, everything can be completely locked down
	 - Ancient motel

**Bureaucracy**: A complex administrative machine
 - Administrators needed to be able to understand both Latin & Greek
	 - Had to take test before assuming office

### Barbarians
 - Barbarian -> People who could not speak Greek -> Could not speak Latin
	 - Defines Greeks vs Others

**Germanic People**:
 - Nucleated villages:
	 - Small agricultural villages (< 200 people)
	 - Central cluster of houses surrounded by land
	 - Sharing tools and labour
 - By 4th/5th larger units -> kingdoms -> dux -> rex
	 - Dux, Rex titles given by emperors, they legitimize the area taken by the barbarians
 - Started coming south from Germany, began displacing many people (particularly Celtic people)
	 - Moved in search of better agricultural land to work with

**Encounter between Romans and Germanic People**:
 - From 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE:
	 - Population growth
	 - Nomadic people from Asia
 - Fluid social structure:
	 - Clan/extended family
	 - Military Chieftains
	 - Tribes (Tribus)
 - By 4th/5th century, larger units turned into Kingdoms
 - Society was now very different than the agricultural one they started with
	 - Previously were fully agriculture, building everything out of wood
		 - Does not leave good archaeological remains
 - Have to rely on Roman sources of the Germans

**Germanic People**:
 - *Wergeld*: "Man-money"
	 - Customary codes
	 - Justice done through payment of a fine
		 - Everybody has a price, if you kill someone then you owe family members that value
 - War and violence, a meritocratic system of sort
	 - Very violent people, not only because they had to fight the Romans
	 - They were in clans and tribes, lots of fighting against each other
		 - Main weakness compared to the Roman empire
 - *Mundium*: Protective ownership of women
 - Religion: From polytheism to Arianism (Ulfilas 383)
