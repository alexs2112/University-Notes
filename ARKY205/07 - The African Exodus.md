### End of an Era
 - 1.4 mya, hominin radiation was over
	 - Australopithecus, Kenyanthropus, Paranthropus were all extinct
	 - Only Homo erectus remained
 - New process: Hominin colonization, dispersal event where H. erectus left Africa

### Radiation vs Dispersal
 - Radiation: Wide diversity of new species evolves, each adapts to a particular ecological niche
	 - Hominin lineage 4 mya
 - Dispersal Event: Single species dramatically expands its geographical range into new ecological niches
	 - 1.8 mya, soon after the first H. erectus appeared in Africa

### Ubeidiya
 - Likely the first stop H. erectus made on the journey north out of Africa
 - Occupied 1.4-1 mya, situated at the edge of a freshwater lake with animal populations similar to Africa
 - Stone tools look like late Oldowan types: choppers, flakes, crude hand axes
 - Similarities with West Africa, obvious spot to settle for hominins familiar with their former territories
 - Geographically closer, not the oldest hominin site outside Africa

### Dmanisi, Georgia
 - Archaeologists excavating European medieval village in 1982, noticed H. erectus bones eroding in the earthen walls
 - Further excavation revealed stone tools, animal bones, five nearly complete H. erectus crania, over 100 postcranial remains
	 - Dated to between 1.83 and 1.77 mya
	 - Stone tools are simple flaked, few choppers, none of the Archeulian bifaces
 - Afterage cranial capacity was 631 cc, high end of H. habilis, low end for H. erectus
 - Skull 4, elderly individual who had lost all but one tooth before death
	 - Eating would have been very challenging, could survive by hammering soft tissues, possibly cared for by the others
 - Activity at Dmanisi is still unclear:
	 - Animal bones have no evidence for cut marks
	 - Stone tools are widely dispersed, not associated with hominin or animal fossils
	 - Fossils and tools found in irregularly shaped pits
	 - Pits may have been formed by water, carcasses and stone tools tumbled in
		 - May have been natural features used as dens by carnivores who brought carcasses inside
	 - Oldest recorded hominin site outside Africa

### Wider Dispersal
 - H. erectus didn't stop in Georgia, evidence for this hominin in Eastern/Southeast Asia, Western Europe
 - How fast did they spread out of Africa? contentious, if accepted then the dispersal was remarkably rapid

### Javanese Evidence
 - First H. erectus fossil ever found in Java in 1890 by paleontologist Eugene Dubois
	 - Instantly controversial, pithecanthropus erectus, "Java Man"
 - Area is still controversial, repeated tests returns different results
 - We do know that H. erectus moved quickly from Georgia to Java
	 - Not an island in this period, Sunda Shelf land bridge connected to SE Asia

### Paleomagnetic Dating
 - Potassiam Argon Dating: only date deposits below, wedged between volcanic events since they heat the potassium, starting decay process, and eject into easily detectable layers
 - Paleomagnetic Dating is more controversial, dates the sediment and less stratigraphically secure
 - Earth's geomagnetic field switches polarity repeatedly, we have a chronology of these switches because the particles with iron orient themselves according to the geomagnetic field
	 - orientation can be assessed by geophysicists
 - Problem: some of the periods between polarity switches are enormous, Olduvai and Cobb Mountain is 600k years

### Why Leave Africa?
 - H. erectus moved out of Africa quickly after they emerged, possibly very quickly
	 - Probably took southerly route across the Arabian Peninsula, around India, crossing minor waterbodies like the mouth of the Red Sea
 - Leaving is not related to population pressure
	 - Possible climate instability, warming trend in early Pleistocene, wouldn't have given them capacity to consider or survive their journey
	 - No elaborate tools were found at early dispersal sites, not technology improvements to adapt to new environments

### Mastery Over Fire?
 - Very little evidence for the use of controlled fire at Oldowan or Acheulean sites in Africa
	 - Some contentious exceptions exist
 - At best, hominins at these sites were transporting fire and could not intentionally produce it
	 - No evidence they were using it to cook meat, no evidence for fire at the earliest sites outside Africa
 - Research on modern hunter gatherers suggests fire fundamentally shapes human societies

### Cognitive Capacity?
 - H. erectus had significantly bigger brains than H. habilis. Development of new social organizations
 - Before H. erectus, all social organization relied on face to face interactions
	 - H. erectus could likely retain information, see societies in time and spacec, social groups could maintain coherence even if they met infrequently
 - Result: H. erectus could survive in areas of seasonal scarcity when groups needed to disperse across wide territories, survive in ecological niches where the earlier hominins could not
 - Wide-ranging social groups led to discovery of new territories as members explored the edges of their core group range, leading to expansion

### After the First Wave
 - After Dmanisi, H. erectus sites are rare until around 500 kya
	 - Some paleoanthropologists call these extra-African hominins H. ergaster
 - Earliest evidence for hominins in western Europe comes from Spain at the site of Atapuerca
	 - Jaw bone, stone tools, animal remains all between 1.2-1.3 mya (Sima del Elefante)
 - Another site near Atapuerca, cave site Gran Dolina, contained many skull bones
	 - Included teeth, jaws, perfect for investigating evolution
	 - Excavators claim this is different than H. erectus, named H. antecessor

### Waves of Migration
 - Theory developed by Spanish excavators at Gran Dolina
	 - Main question: Why did it take so long (500k years) for people to move from Georgia west into Spain
 - Possible answer: H. erectus/ergaster was in western Europe earlier with no evidence
 - Spanish answer: H. antecessor colonized Europe first, descendent of H. erectus
	 - 500k years because it required a biological adaptation to the temperate climate
		 - Previously specialized in the tropical zone of Africa
 - Either way, small mobile groups, archaeological record would have been very sparse and only identified by accident

### Cannibalism?
 - Hominin bones show signs of cutting and breakage. Signs of cannibalism, stone choppers broke bones and flakes to remove meat
 - Hominids here were not living in the cave, they were the prey
 - Did other H. antecessor groups kill and eat them? was it larger H. erectus homids? Did animals kill them and drag their bodies into the caves where they were scavenged?

### Eurasian Acheulian
 - Bose, China, earliest Acheulian industry discovered outside of Africa
	 - 800 kya
	 - Only site in China with handaxes, very crudely made, otherwise Chinese H. erectus sites include all chopper tools
 - Next earliest dated Acheulian site outside Africa: Gesher Benot Ya'akov in Israel north of the Sea of Galilee
	 - 780 kya
	 - Hominins here used fire to cook nuts
 - Boxgrove, England: One of the best known Acheulian sites in Europe
	 - 500 kya
	 - Handaxes were becoming much better made (hard and soft hammer percussion) and flakes were sharpened
	 - Toolkits were expanding, becoming more sophisticated

### Zhoukoudian Caves, China
 - 500 kya, new features at H. erectus sites
	 - Some paleoanthropologists use the name H. heidelbergensis to refer to H. erectus after this date in Europe, Africa
 - In Asia, H. erectus is still used
	 - Zhoukoudian Cave near Beijing has revealed 40 H. erectus individuals, over 100k stone tools (choppers, flakes)
 - Famous Peking Man fossil, H. erectus pekinesis
 - Massive site, deposits are 48m deep, occupations are dated 500-300 kya
	 - Thought to have earliest confirmed evidence for fire. Contentious, likely true due to dark caves

### Changing Species
 - Beeche Pit, England: Burned bones, stone tools dating to 400 kya
 - Qesem Cave, Israel: Remains of hearths from 300 kya, included wood ash
 - Fire being manufactured by hominins at this point, likely changing their social structures
 - Anatomical studies of H. erectus wrist morphology suggest excellent throwers
	 - Advent of this period: Oldest evidence for throwing spears
 - Schoningen, Germany: Three spruce rods discovered with sharpened ends, dated to 400 kya
 - Kathu Pan, South Africa: Stone tools dated to 500 kya had pointed tips, appeared fractured by high-velocity impacts
 - Evidence: H. erectus, maybe H. neanderthalensis, making spears and using them to hunt as early as 500 kya

### H. erectus ritual?
 - No solid evidence for artwork, ritual behaviour in Lower Paleolithic contexts
 - Volcanic pebble from the site of Berekhat Ram between Israel, Syria might represent a female form
	 - Earliest venus at 230 to 700 kya?
 - Shell alongside H. erectus bones and stone tools on Java contained geometric engravings, deposit dated between 540, 430 kya
 - Evidence is slight, not until Upper Paleolithic that ritual and artwork are apparent

### Pit of Bones
 - Site at Atapuerca: Over 4000 bone fragments found dating between 400-600 kya
 - 28 individuals, men and women, 4-35 years old
	 - Huge variation in skeletal characteristics between height and cranial capacity (some close to modern humans)
 - None of the bones had evidence of trauma except one: one skull had two blows to the head by a weapon
 - Only one stone tool found: well-made but unused handaxe
	 - No campsite
	 - Space for ritual internmnet for the dead? at least a convenient spot for disposal
 - Bones appear to represent a late variation of H. heidelbergensis, ancestor of H. neanderthalensis
