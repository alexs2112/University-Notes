# South Asia and China
### Indus Valley
- Descends from Himalayas, winds for 3000 km through Pakistan before flowing into Arabian Sea
	- Bounded rich agricultural lands
- Unpredictable not because of flow, but because it frequently changes course
- Harappan civilization extended over the whole valley and along the coast of the Arabian Sea
- Trade networks connected the Harappan by sea to the Arabian Peninsula and Mesopotamia, overland to Iran and Afghanistan

### Mehrgarh
 - Site west of Indus in the Balochistan highlands in Pakistan
	 - Oldest evidence for farming in Pakistan (7000-2500 BCE)
 - Agriculture based on plants and animals first domesticated in SW Asia
	 - Would form basis of agriculture in the Harappan period
 - Level IIa (5500-4800 BCE): Many buildings, curious square-shaped cells (silos for surplus crops)
 - Some believe these Mehrgarh people migrated east, founded the Indus Valley civilization
	 - No direct proof of this

### The Harappan Period
 - 1850: British railway link between Lahore and Multan, found mounds of brick rubble and decided to use it
	 - Confusing: No Buddhist-period remains were found, took 50 years before they realized these mounds represented cities of a previously unknown civilization
 - Earliest settlement in the Indus Valley occurs in Pre-Harappan period (3300-2600 BCE)
	 - Large villages with fortification walls (unknown purpose)
 - True Harappan period lasted 700 years (2600-1900 BCE), marked by several small sites becoming major urban centers with very uniform material culture
 - Cities have common features: Structures are laid out on regular grids, good overall sense of order and emphasis on hygiene with elaborate drains, wells and buildings made of very standardized bricks
 - Most sites: Small villages, five are larger than 80 ha, two best known: Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro
 - Arguments that each city had elite area on high mound/citadel overlooking non-elite residents in the town
	 - Speculative and problematic
 - Excavations at cities revealed some larger buildings (interpreted as granaries)
	 - No evidence to definitively say these are granaries, clearly public buildings of some kind
 - Most impressive structure: Great Bath of Mohenjo-Daro
	 - Public access, nearby well used to fill it
 - No evidence for elite structures in these cities, communal places where people converged and shared in agricultural surplus while enjoying aspects of bathing culture
 - **Dholavira**: Smaller settlement supports these interpretations with some ambiguity
	 - Internal walls divide into Lower, Middle, Upper areas, with large open areas
	 - Most incredible finds: Large wells with massive water tanks
	 - No palaces, no civic control areas, no rich sectors. Civic council controlled movements of some people
 - **Cemeteries**: Some cities had cemeteries
	 - Most comprehensive: Rakhigarhi, east of Harappa
	 - Individuals buried on backs with simple clay vessels and jewelry, few cases of multiple burials
	 - Symbolic burials with grave goods but no bodies
	 - Most people are young adults, some children and elderly are represented
		 - Some differentiation among burials, possible markers of status
	 - Evidence for violence is very very rare
 - **Script**: Small stone sealings used to mark vessels and bundles
	 - Each inscription only has a few characters, over 400 signs are knowns
	 - Undeciphered, either logographic (signs=words) or ideographic (signs=concepts)
	 - Show they had complex administration system
	 - Another find: Carefully standardized weights (plain cubes of rock) likely used in trading goods
 - **Government**: Highly organized, evidence implies a bureaucracy
	 - Writing and standard measures, bricks of remarkably similar sizes, unparalleled urban sewage system
	 - Identity of the elite and evidence for rulers remains obscure, no obviously rich houses or monuments
	 - Few sculptures might reflect royalty, "Priest King" is most famous (fancy cloth and jewelry)

### Controvery of State Formation in China
 - Ideological demands of modern Chinese state limits scholars abilities to freely interpret the process of early state formation in China
	 - New generation of Chinese archaeologists are changing this story, interest in global method and theory, invitations for international surveys in China resulting in more data being available
 - Chinese historical texts: The Three Dynasties (Xia, Shang, Zhou) emerge in northern China between 2000-500 BCE
	 - Transition from agriculture to urban state societies

### Three Dynasties
 - Yi-Luo Valley: Political center of the Xia and Early Shang Dynasties
	 - Site Erlitou (1800-1600 BCE) may have been the Xia capital
	 - Two earthen terraces were likely palaces
 - Yi-Luo River Valley Archaeological Project: Explored broader regiona context for emergence of cities at Erlitou and Yanshi through archaeological survey
	 - Early Longshan (3000-2000 BCE) preceded emergence of Erlitou with two large villages
	 - Once Erlitou appears, regional center built nearby with secondary centers and 40+ villages
 - Point: Erlitou sat at the top of a four-tier settlement hierarchy

### Evidence From Anyang
 - 19th century antiquities markets in China sold old bones inscribed with ancient symbols (dragon bones)
	 - Source: Traced to small village in northern China
	 - Excavation: Remains of huge city (Anyang), capital of the Late Shang Dynasty (1200-1045 BCE)
 - Massive platforms supported palace-temple area with other large buildings, all arranged in clusters by function
	 - Elite individuals lived in structures on the platforms whereas everyone else lived in semi-subterranean houses dug into the ground around this complex
 - Site has an enormous associated cemetery: 1000+ simple burials, 11 deep burial pits
	 - Most famous tomb: Fu Hao, wife of a king, buried with enormous quantities of goods
 - These bones sold in antiquities markets were oracle bones
	 - Used by Shang kings to predict things like battles or the weather
	 - Would ask a question during a ceremony, then apply heat to one side of the bone until it cracked, interpreted the cracks
	 - Late Shang period: Interpretations inscribed on the bone, earliest systematic writing from China
 - 150k oracle bones are known, provide information on the lives of Shang Dynasty rulers

### Other Examples of State Formation in China
 - Rizhao area of Shangdong Province, coast of Yellow Sea and far from Shang and Xia capitals: Huge population increase, four-tier settlement occurs centuries before Erlitou
 - Chifeng region, inner Mongolia: Between agricultural societies and pastoral nomads, no massive settlements found but populations increased by 2000 BCE with defensive walls
 - Taosi in the Jinnan basin: Began as fortified center with extreme differences in social stratification
	 - 2000 BCE: City walls destroyed, commoner spaces extend over the whole settlement
	 - Cemeteries show extreme violence with mass burials, first documented social revolution?

### Basis of Authority in Early China
 - Military strength was important, critical to Shang power:
	 - Legitimacy rested on the role rulers played by performing rituals
 - Key: Power of divination, most important symbol of this power in richly decorated bronze vessels
	 - Bronze vessels were exclusive domain of royalty and nobility
 - Power of rulers not in their identification with a god, it was their role in connecting the human world with the divine
	 - Feasting evidence (consumption vessels) previously found in all burials. In Shang period only elite burials
	 - Sacrificed animals and humans found in huge numbers on Shang sites. Some pits included burnt and broken objects (likely offerings)

### Warfare and Consolidation
 - Emerging states of the Three Dynasties was a massive area, still China was not a unified political entity
 - Zhou warfare drew on new tools: Iron and horse warfare
 - Unification of China in 221 BCE under Ying Zheng (first emperor of the Qin) was a turning point
	 - His tomb included the Terracotta Army (8000+ life size ceramic soldiers)
	 - Conceived of the Great Wall at the northern border of his new empire

### Other Asian States
 - Unification of China affected far beyond its territory through contact (economic, military) with other places
 - Japan: 200 CE, Keyhole shaped tombs appear, later develop into Kofun period (250-710 CE) and the beginning of Japanese state society
	 - Chinese imperial wealth traded into Japan to help fund their elites
 - Tarim Basin, NE China: Preserved burials in the desert show wealth travelling along Silk Route in an area of contact and exchange

### Angkor
 - Established in the southern Mekong Plain in Cambodia around 800 CE, abandoned in 1431
 - Power in this state: Based on intensive rice agriculture, taxation, military, ritual position of rulers
 - Monumental artificial basins built to help with irrigation
	 - So big they were likely symbolic, served to represent oceans while temples were symbolic mountains
 - Elaborate temples show the ritual position of the rulers of Angkor, associated with Shiva, royal power included the right to make moral laws
 - Southern Silk Route connected Hindu and Buddhist religions in southern Asia, core of the ideology of Angkor
 - 250 CE: Chinese histories mention Funan and Zehnla states, likely correspond to sites in Thailand (300BCE-200CE)
 - 100-550 CE: Cities emerge in the Mekong Delta, Oc Eo in Vietnam is well-known
	 - Walls and moats with canals
	 - Prosperous trading center with temples and rich items
	 - Also found here: Roman coin from Antoninus Pius, trade network reached the Mediterranean
 - Wealth of China helped facilitate trade relationships throughout southern Asia, added great wealth to the growing urban centers as far south as Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam

### India and China Compared
 - Harappan civilization in the Indus valley developed around the same time as the Great Pyramids in Egypt
 - Defining characteristics of Indus civilization:
	 - Well-planned urban centers (Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro)
	 - Complete lack of monumental architecture or any kind of centralized ruler
 - Early Chinese states depended on royal ritual to establish authority
	 - Complex process over three dynasties and a massive region
	 - Archaeological research proving that the state did not emerge with the Shang, but was a product of long term transformations
 - Impact of China on surrounding regions was profound
	 - Silk Route cut through other social territories, transformed nomadic and agricultural societies in varying ways
