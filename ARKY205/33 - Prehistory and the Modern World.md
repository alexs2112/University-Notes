### Ending of Old World Prehistory
 - Egypt and Mesopotamia: After heiroglyphs and cuneiform, these societies fully enter the Bronze Age. Historians and archaeologists can trace their histories with excellent detail after 3500 BCE
 - India and China: After Harappa, civilization in west India and Pakistan spreads east, enters Iron Age, eventually develops into kingdoms that develop Sanskrit (600 BCE). In China, Qin dynasty would quickly succumb to the Han (200 BCE), the history of dynastic China is historically well-known
 - Europe: Minoan supremacy of Crete would fall to the Mycenaeans around 1500 BCE. 1177 BCE, Bronze Age societies would collapse. From the following Dark Age, Iron Age Archaic and Classical Greeks appear (700 BCE)

### The West
 - North and South America: Denied a local social development after the emergence of states
 - Greeks often described as tradition from which Western society is derived (democracy, philosophy, maths)
 - Romans were as transformative. Christianity, early capitalism, concept of private property protected by law
 - Result: Western society became stuck in a system of accumulation, relied heavily on individualism, exploitation, territorial expansion.
	 - Christian church helped sanctify and promote these attitudes throughout the Middle Ages

### Rounding Africa
 - One century after the Black Death, Europe entered period of unprecedented growth and wealth accumulation
	 - 1/3 of Europe died, labour wages rose and rent agreements were less exploitative
 - 1488: Bartolomeu Dias reached the Cape of Good Hope, rounded the southern tip of Africa
	 - Encountered the Khoe Khoe herders who wandered with cattle, described as primitive peoples, half-apes
	 - Lifeways destroyed 70 years later when a European settlement was built here (1652), herding adaptations were impossible with the spread of European farmers and the concept of private property
**Vasco da Gama**:
 - 1497: Used Dias'  route, continued up the East African coast at Kenya, followed trade winds east to India
	 - Alternative route to gold and spice markets of South/Southeast Asia, previously only by land
 - Insatiable appetite for wealth in preindustrial Europe
	 - Route travelled by numerous sailors, transporting gold, ivory, slaves, spices back to Europe
	 - Next few centuries: Coastal Africa exploited by European and Islamic nations for slaves

### The New World
 - Cristoforo Colombo sailed west to find another passage to Asia, landed in the Bahamas and then Cuba in 1492
	 - Word of the voyage spread around Spain and Portugal, additional voyages of exploration + exploitation
 - 1517: Spanish conquistadors landed in the Gulf of Mexico
	 - Hernan Cortes landed at Veraccruz in 1519, Aztec ruler Moctezuma believed they were the prophesized return of Quetzalcoatl
	 - Instead of divine benevolence they brought warfare, influenza, smallpox
	 - 1529: Whole of Mexico under Spanish control, hundreds of thousands were dead
 - 1532: Francisco Pizarro and a party of Spanish conquistadors landed in northern Peru
	 - Inca in a state of political chaos with populations decimated by previous European visits, smallpox, disease
	 - Civil war allowed Pizarro to take the guise of diplomat
	 - 1534: Murdered the Incan victor and the last preindustrial state collapsed

### The North
 - First encounters between Europeans and indigenous Americans occurred around the year 1000
	 - Norse travellers from Scandinavia moves west across the North Atlantic
 - Erik the Red travelled to southern Greenland in 985
 - Around 1000, Leif Eriksson travelled around northeastern Canadian coast, lande in Newfoundland
 - Norse settlement established at L'Anse aux Meadows, where Europeans encountered the ancestors of the later Beothuk indigenous culture. Settlement lasted only 20 years
 - Several hundred years before Basque fishers began travelling to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia looking for food
	 - 1497: Giovanni Caboto travelled to Newfoundland
	 - 1508-1509: Explored Labrador, Atlantic Canada down to Chesapeake Bay, Maryland

### Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries
 - After 1600: Europeans came to Americas in greater numbers looking for wealth or a new home
	 - Missionaries also arrived to seek Christian converts
 - 1606: Dutch traveller Willem Janszoon reaches Australia
	 - Settlement was sparse until mid-18th century, English convicts and rebels sent to establish colonies
	 - Settlers brutalized Australian aboriginal peoples
 - Soon after: Permanent European residents arriving everywhere, bringing iron tools, firearms, cutting down woodlands to build new communities and farmlands
 - Indigenous communities had no choice but to move to marginal lands to preserve tiny aspects of their lifeways
	 - Today: No traditional lifeways survive untouched by modern civilization

### The Narrative of Prehistory
 - Ancient world that began 4 mya in Africa disappeared over several centuries of industrialized European contact
	 - This history only exists as studied through scientific archaeological research
 - Narrative is always changing with new theories and discoveries, final word of prehistory has yet to be written
 - What follows are examples that illustrate the dangers in archaeological investigation
	 - Prehistoric evidence used to fortify nationalist and racist narratives of ethnic superiority for political gain in a number of countries around the world.
**Kossinna and the Indo-European Language**:
 - 1902: Gustaf Kossinna asserted the origin of the Indo-European language was northern Germany and Scandinavia
	 - Kossina believed ethnicity was easily associated with material culture
 - Proclaimed Indo-European originated with Corded Ware people
	 - Also argued Poland should be part of Germany given historical ethnic similarities
 - Considered the Romans and Franks (Merovingians and Carolingians) to be destroyers of culture, Germans looked to preserve
 - One of the leading figures in early 20th century British archaeology, V. Gordon Childe, adopted Kossinna's Indo-European theory in his book *The Aryans: A Study of Indo-European Origins*
	 - Would later denounce Kossinna, these ideas were clearly palatable in the early 20th century
**Nazis and German Superiority Myths**:
 - Nazis took Kossinna's German nationalist perspective on the past, amplified it to justify numerous atrocities
	 - Social power in foundation myths, promoted and conducted archaeological research designed to underwrite the racial hygiene agenda of its leading members
 - Paradox: Nazis saw Nordic peoples as the superior ethnicity, also most vulnerable to destrution via genetic/cultural mixing
	 - Justified contemporary racist, sexist perspectives by conducting excavations, interpreting the material patterning to reflect white male superiority in war, politics, economics
**Celtic Origins of America**:
 - Dr Barry Fell wrote *America BC*, thinks Celts discovered America 2000 years ago and influenced the Algonquin-speaking peoples by teaching them Scottish Gaelic (didn't exist until 600 CE) and inspiring Mississippian cultures to build civilization (mounds at Cahokia)
	 - Evidence: Gaelic word that sounds similar to the Algonquin word for "pit", series of scratches on rocks in the eastern US he claims are written in Ogham (Irish script from 4th-6th century CE)
		 - Actually naturally occurring scratches from glacial activity
 - Main rebuke: If a Celtic civilization existed in the eastern US we would have evidence for it
	 - Theories about white Europeans advancing indigenous Americans is rooted in white supremacy

### Rigour of Archaeological Interpretation
 - Imperative for archaeologists to adhere to the highest standards of reasoning and interpretive integrity
	 - Fragmented record can be twisted to argue for a variety of perspectives by evidence and supposition
 - There is no "right" version of the past, but there are plenty of wrong versions that do not adhere to standards
	 - Often called pseudoarchaeology, not a harmless alternative view to established scientific thought
	 - Undermines the value of expertise, influenced by political or personal biasas
 - Prehistory is not a stepping stone to modernity, it is a reminder that human society has always been complex

### Prehistory and Resilience
 - Increasingly faced with environmental stress and social unrest
 - To ensure that the positive elements of modern society endure, think like our prehistoric ancestors and learn from their successes and failures
	 - Our greatest strength is our cognitive capacities, abilities to work together in groups for mutual gain
	 - Social and economic systems are not static, if they are to survive they must adapt and not be forcefully pinned to a perceived status quo of previous generations
 - Prehistory reminds us that there are other ways to live our lives and organize societies beyond the world in which we've been stuck for the last several hundred years

### Core Tenants of Archaeological Interpretation
1. We cannot cherry pick evidence (choose to only present data that furthers our point, hide data that disproves it)
2. Evidence must be explainable through the logic of historical science (stratigraphy, context, typology, chronology)
3. Cannot make a claim based on negative or weak evidence, deflect the burden of proof to critics
4. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, unproven hypotheses can't form the foundation of new theories or understandings
