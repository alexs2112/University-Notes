### Beginning
 - Darwin, obessed with explaining incredible variation in the living world
	 - Suggested Natural Selection was the motor of evolution
	 - Wrote very little about human evolution
 - 19th century, questions posed: What is the relationship between humans and our closest living relatives (chimps, gorillas)?
	 - Question of questions

### Archaeology of the Distant Past
 - This period, difficult to interpret archaeological record
 - Evidence: Heavily fragmented fossilized bone, stratigraphic context
 - Process: Fine judgment of anatomical details on bone fragments, assessment of chronology, stratigraphy, genetic studies
 - Record is very thin, between 5 and 1 mya, fewer than 5k individuals, most are single teeth in South African caves
	 - Over these 4 million years, hominins experienced huge transformations in tropical Africa
 - Most rare but most informative: skull fragments or jaws, detail changes to diet and cranial capacities (size of brain)

### Language of Evolution
 - Basic unit of biological classification: Species
 - Group of similar species: Genus (we are genus homo)
 - Genera are grouped into Tribes, Subfamilies, Families, Superfamilies
	 - Similar families are grouped into orders
 - Humans, gibbons, great apes (gorillas, chimps) are superfamily Hominoidea (hominoids)
	 - With monkeys and prosimians (lemurs, lorises, tarsiers) order Primates
 - In common: relying heavily on sight to deal with environment, propensity for highly social relationships and living in groups
 - Classifications are based on similarity between species, meant to reflect branching patterns of evolution
	 - Splitting process with distinct lineages
 - Phylogeny: evolutionary history, formed from combining information from fossils, genetics (mostly living populations, some fossils)
 - Main Takeaway: We branched off from a common ancestor with chimps about 6-4 million years ago
	 - We are included in this group, hominins

### Early Hominin Diversity
 - Don't know much between 9 and 5 mya
 - Between 4 and 2 mya, explosion of hominen species (term: radiation) and we know more about them
 - 3 distinct genera emerged:
	 - Kenyanthropus
	 - Australopithecus
	 - Paranthropus
 - Often considered together as Australopithecines
 - Notable physical differences in bone size, shape
 - Broad similarities:
	 - Pelvises were adapted for walking upright
	 - They may have been adapted for easily climbing trees
	 - Brain size consistently between 450-475 cubic cm (cc), high end for modern great apes
	 - Lacked pronounced canine teeth like modern great apes
 - Emergence of hominin lineage (particularly Homo) linked to changing climate

### Early Hominin Climate
 - Begins deep in geological time during later Cenozoic
 - Temperature for most of the Cenozoic was warmer than today
	 - Changed during the Oligocene epoch around 35 mya (first signs of glacial cooling appear around Antarctica)
 - Major drop in global temperature occurs between 14, 11 mya during the Miocene
	 - Large ice sheets in high latitudes
	 - Around 3.2 mya, just after first Homo in tropical Africa, glaciation intensifies and Earth enters present period of constantly fluctuating climate
		 - Pleistocene Epoch (2.58 mya to 12 kya)
			 - Great Ice Age
		 - Quaternary period

### Early Hominin Africa
 - East African Savanna
 - Drop in world temperatures resulted in increasingly open environment in tropical latitudes
 - Reduction of forests likely benefited ground-adapted species
	 - Always knew at some point in the past we began to walk upright (bipedally, not chimps)
 - Assumption was bipedalism must have developed alongside our other significant difference from chimps: big brain
	 - This was eventually wrong

### East African Rift Valley
 - Very little evidence for the lives of early hominins
 - Most dates to a period of the Upper (early) Paleolithic, stone tools and fossil remains discarded throughout the landscape
	 - Don't have good evidence for stone tools associated with Australopithecines
 - Evidence for this period comes from sites in East African Rift Valley
	 - Massive trough began separating 22-25 mya
	 - Excellent for finding sites:
		 - As a trough it fills with sediments, great environment for preserving archaeological and paleontological sites
		 - Tectonically active, lots of erosion, new sites exposed frequently
		 - Volcanically active and volcanic ash (tuffs) can be dated using argon method

### Olduvai Gorge
 - Most important site for human evolution
	 - Louis and Mary Leakey, decades of research revolutionized ideas of prehistory
 - 2 mya, small lake surrounded by grasslands and marshes, over time it was filled with sediments
	 - 200 kya, modern streams began to carve a canyon through the soft sediments, exposing fossil and stone tool sites
 - First research involved walking along the canyon, collecting material falling out of the erosional faces
 - At least 5 geological strata are recognized
|Strata|Age|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Masek Beds|0.6-0.4 mya|Surficial aeolian ash (few fossils)|
|Bed IV|0.8-0.6 mya|5-8 m clays|
|Bed III|1.15-0.8 mya|6-10 m sandstone, clays (few fossils)|
|Bed II| 1.7-1.15 mya|21-35 m sandstone and clays|
|Bed I| 1.9-1.7 mya|20-46 m tuff and clays|

### Australopithecus
 - Known from as many as six, maybe 10, distinct species
 - Fossil contexts have been dated fbetween 4 and 1.8 mya (Pliocene, Pleistocene)
 - Most specimens come from East Africa, single discovery from Chad shows they were also in Central Africa
	 - Australopithecus Bahrelghazali
 - Skull of STW 573 (Little Foot) found in cave in Sterkfontein, South Africa
	 - Small brain size, protruding brow ridge, massive jaw, lack of large canines
	 - Sterkfontein was a fissure collecting material falling from the surface, fell to its death?

### Kenyanthropus
 - Approximately 3.5 mya (Pliocene)
 - Poorly understood species, very similar to Australopithecus
 - Discovered by Maeve Leakey (2001) on shore of late Turkana in northern Kenya

### Paranthropus
 - Robust Australopithecus due to massive molars, face muscles that aided in chewing
 - Earliest know specimen dates to 2.5 mya, most recent to 1.4 mya (Pleistocene)
 - Louis Leakey nicknamed them Nutcracker Man, believed huge jaw helped subsist on diet of seeds or fruits with hard outer coatings

### Most Famous Australopithecus
 - Donald Johnson in 1974, Hadar region of Ethiopia, named Lucy
 - 40% of Lucy was discovered, allowed researchers to better reconstruct early hominin lifeways
 - Several hundred fossilized remains, context dating to 3.2 mya (argon-argon dating in volcanic ash)
	 - Estimated 1.1 m (3'7") tall, weighed 29 kg (64 lb)
	 - Teeth suggested she ate some tough foods (roots, seeds), also softer items (plants, nuts, insects, eggs)
 - Most important: Lucy's pelvis was nearly identical to modern humans, walked upright
	 - Cranial capacity was very small, similar to modern chimps
	 - Earlier: Prior to Lucy, evolutionary bioliogists assumed brain size and bipedal locomotion evolved together
		 - Intense debate

### Laetoli, Tanzania
 - 1976: Mark Leakey founnd 24 m long trackway of footfall impressions in volcanic ash, dated to 3.7 mya
 - Shows that Pliocene hominins were habitually walking upright (no knuckle impressions)
 - Footprints represent three individuals, one walking in footprints of the others
	 - Instead of big toe of apes, arch like our feet
	 - Smaller individual had a deeper impression on one side, suggest it was a woman carrying a child (or something) on one side
 - Significance: Hominins were fully bipedal before evolution of big human brains, 1 mya before first stone tools appear
	 - Still climb trees?

### Dikika Child
 - 2002, nearly complete 3.32 mya female skeleton in Dikika region of Ethiopia
 - Toddler, 2.5-3 years old (nicknamed Selam)
	 - Most complete early human child before the neanderthals
 - Most incredible aspect: Nearly complete left foot
	 - Very good at walking bipedally, not an obligate strider (like H. erectus)
	 - Base of big toe suggests it was very prehensile, easily climb trees
 - Probably not evolutionary advantageous to be stuck on the ground all the time
	 - Large predators, no way to defend themselves, small people
	 - Probably spent a lot of time in trees

### Problems with Leaving the Trees
 - Getting around in open country was hard
	 - Bipedalism evolved to spend more time feeding on food resources on the ground
	 - Relatively big, needed lots of food, more advantageous to be mobile
	 - Mobility exposed them to unpredictable, seasonal resources. Became good at tolerating weather and climate
	 - Developed sophisticated sweat glands to enhance endurance during long-distance foraging
	 - Bipedalism is a more efficient way to move than a quadrupedal gait (knuckle walking)
		 - Knuckle walking is better for jumping into trees, short sprints
 - Savanna was full of predators
	 - Home to lions, leopards, hyenas. Sleeping on the ground should be avoided
	 - No evidence for settlement during these early periods
		 - Assumed home bases for shelter from the hot sun, sleeping above the ground in trees
	 - Topic greatly debated, most evidence comes from observing contemporary chimps and gorillas
 - High quality plant foods were widely dispersed
	 - In forest: they were abundant and always nearby. Not so much in the savanna
	 - Later foragers subsisted off a broad range of plants and animals, maybe hominin ancestors expanded their food range during this period (more meat?)
	 - Mammals that ate more meat usually have large brains
		 - As they ate more meat their brain size probably increased, less apelike and more human like over several hundred thousand years

### Outcome of Problems
 - Brains became larger, expanded into more territories, hands were free
 - Before long, using tools
 - Evidence is slight, bones with cut marks were found in Dikika region of Kenya (3.4 mya)
 - Between 2011, 2014, dozens of stone flakes and cores were founda t a site associated with Kenyanthropus, Lomekwi 3 (3.3 mya)
