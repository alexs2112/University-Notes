### End of the Aurignacian
 - Assemblages disappear from most of Europe around 29-27 kya
	 - Same time as Neanderthals were disappearing
	 - In some areas (France, Austrai) assemblages continue a bit later (25-20 kya)
 - New material culture group forming: Gravettian (30-27 kya)
	 - Strong similarities between Gravettian sites all over the continent

### Gravettian Distinctions
 - Blades are much more finely made, better technology
 - Steeper, more abrupt retouch
 - Differing distribution of particular stone tool type
	 - Straight-backed points with abrupt retouch along the back, backed bladelets and other microliths, tanged and shouldered points, small burins
 - Proportion of general tool classes, burins more abundant
 - Lack of steep and nosed scrapers
 - Lack of certain characteristic bone and antler artifacts
 - Presence of new forms of artwork, including more female figurines
 - Magnitude of differences suggest these two culture groups were different biological populations

### Gravettian Ethnicity
 - Archaeologists don't like attributing ethnicity to Paleolithic material culture
	 - Stone tools are influenced more by raw material and function
	 - Ethnicity is actively expressed in periods of high population density, Paleolithic Europe was sparesely populated
 - However new material culture forms may arise from different learned traditions instead of patterns of interaction

### Gravettian Technology
 - Flaked tools include lots of fine blades and steep retouch to both shape tools and create blunt backed edges on points and knives
 - Lots of variation: Can assign different types of points and burins to different phases
	 - Suggests patterns of interaction, chronological development
 - See ground stone technology for the first time
	 - Large grinding stones found in Ukraine and Russia
	 - Stones with grounded depressions, store animal fat, burned with lichen or bark wicks for light
 - Earliest evidence for ceramic manufacture in the world
	 - Evidence for ceramic barriers for windbreaks or drains
	 - No pots
	 - Evidence for sophisticated industry in basket weaving and linens
 - People had time to develop these craft industries, weren't entirely nomadic

### Gravettian Subsistence
 - Lots of variation
 - Spain and Italy: Small animals, larger game, indicates mixed forest and steppe environment
 - French and German: Caves, numerous large game, more diverse animals, 85-98% are reindeer with few mammoths
 - Southern Poland: Large, 80% mammoth, treeless tundra
 - Middle Dneiper and Densa: Fewer mammoths, more hares and foxes. Further south in Moravia, mammoths are less than 20% and some are scavenged
 - All evidence suggests big-game hunting with spears, small game captured with nets

### Gravettian Settlement
 - Period of definitive hut construction
	 - Semi-subterranean oval depressions with wooden or mammoth bone frameworks
	 - Ring of rocks or bones to hold down hides as tents
	 - Some were massive, likely windbreaks or partial shelter, hearths common inside and outside

### Gravettian Exchange
- Sites not evenly distributed, likely reflect population centers in southwest France, middle Danube
- Evidence for trade from considerable distances, 800-1000 km away
- Motivation: Adornment, social + economic safety nets where relationships were more important than the goods themselves
- Harsh and variable environment, people needed help when resources failed

### Clay Figurines
 - Dolni Vestonice, Czech Republic: 6000 clay pieces found
 - Figurines molded in pieces and attached
 - Most famous: Venus of Dolni Vestonice: Larger and more detailed
 - Suspect this ceramic industry focused on making figurines as part of ritual performance of hunting magic or divination

### Gravettian Art, Ornamentation
 - Wide communication networks facilitating spread of artwork and adornment
 - Beads, Pendants, Cave Paintings/Engravings
 - Venus statuettes are not just ceramic, some are stone, all over Europe and have common elements
 - Don't know what they signify
 - Venus of Brassempouy: 25 kya, head of a woman wearing a headdress
 - Venus of Willendorf: 25-30 kya, chubby, impressions around head

### Gravettian Burial
 - Lots of evidence for burial
 - Most are single burials with deceased covered in red ochre, accompanied by many grave goods
 - Sungir burial in Russia: Buried head to head in ochre, 13k beads, stone tools, weapons, adornments
 - 9000 hours just to make the beads, was this status or something else?

### Last Glacial Maximum
 - 25000 BP, climate began to deteriorate culminating in last glacial maximum between 20k-18k BP
 - Northwestern Europe was a polar desert
 - Southern Europe much more habitable, tundra with some trees, more herbivores
 - Populations plummeted between 25-14k BP

### Solutrean
 - During last glacial maximum, new matrial culture emerged in southern Europe, 21-17k BP
 - Main distinction: Huge number of well-made stone points
	 - Types: Laurel leaf, willow leaf, shouldered, notched
	 - Some are hafted onto spears with cord and resin
 - Endscrapers are common, mousterian style scrapers and points also emerge, burins very rare
 - Thinnest, best-made stone tools of the entire stone age
	 - Mastery of pressure flaking
	 - Some so large they were not functional, ceremonial or trade goods
 - Some sites have a huge number of these points

### Site of Solutre
 - Most sites are caves or rockshelters, disturbed by natural processes
 - Solutre: Open-air site situated at the base of a cliff
 - Used for mass animal drives over a 20k year period
 - In Solutrean, horses are the dominant species (94%), around 34k horses killed here
	 - Animals are all adults, little evidence for butchery
	 - Killed in the summer, more meat here than needed and much was wasted
 - Few reindeer also found, killed one by one so lots of butchery and every piece was used
 - Site has no huts, one part of a settlement system

### Solutrean Subsistence, Regional Interactions
 - Horses important at Solutre, nowhere else
 - Reindeer main food source, less large game to hunt than Gravettians due to environment
 - Big game hunting continued to become more diversified
	 - Also birds, fish, shellfish, seals
 - Economic diversification needed to cope with declining environmental productivity
 - Settlements contracted during this period, exchange networks continued to operate
 - New technology introduced: Spear thrower (Atlatl)
	 - Stick with a haft for a spear on the end, works as an axle to extend throwing range and power

### Solutrean Art and Ritual
 - Pendants, beads, bracelets of bone and ivory all known from sites
 - Red and yellow ochre, black manganese, all for body painting and cave artwork
 - Evidence for burials is completely lacking
 - Argument that the environmental stress and compression of populations into glacial refuges led to regional groups emerging as a response to increasing competition for diminishing resources

### Epigravettian
 - Some communities continued in parts of Italy, Balkans, Moravia
	 - Stone tools continue Gravettian tradition with some variations
	 - Traces are so thin, brief visits or seasonal uses between 20k-18k BP
 - Largest change: Evidence for storage pits dug into the permafrost
	 - Intensive hunting in autumn allowed for winter storage
	 - Larger groups could survive and remain more sedentary than previously
