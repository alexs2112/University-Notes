### Grading:
 - 3 Assignments: 10% each
 - 4 Exams: 15%, 15%, 20%, 20% (not cumulative)

### Prehistory:
 - Predate writing: 6000 years (symbols were widely used before that, 100k words)
 - Higher complexity and specificity with words and writing
 - 2 million year gap between the earliest member of the Homo genus and the earliest deciphered script in cuneiform, no texts to help understand this period

### Archaeology:
 - Goal: Understand the past from the perspective of the archaeological record
 - Challenge: Deeply fragmented due to randomness of preservation, find ways to understand these traces with scientific rigour

### Methods of Investigation:
 - Provenance: History of an object, past roles
 - Survey: Surface of the earth, collect and identify artifacts, site boundaries
 - Excavation: Controlled stratigraphic removal of depositional layers from a site to understand their spatial and temporal relationships
 - Artifacts < Sites < Landscapes

### Context:
 - Spatial and temporal position of all objects, allow for interpretation of material culture, relationships over space and time
 - Horizontal Context: Relationships between artifacts on sites, between sites on landscapes
 - Vertical Context: Encountered through excavation
