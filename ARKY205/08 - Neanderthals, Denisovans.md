### Age of Homo
 - Sometime after 500-400 kya (second half of Middle Pleistocene/Middle Paleolithic)
	 - Skeletal remains show lots of variability in H. erectus populations (ergaster, antecessor, heidelbergensis)
 - Between 250-125 kya, these hominins being replaced by (evolved into) Neanderthals in Europe, Denisovans in Asia, archaic Homo sapiens in Africa
	 - Had a common ancestor (likely H. erectus) 750 kya
	 - About 400 kya, Neanderthals and Denisovans had a common ancestor
 - Know much more about Neanderthals (300 individuals) than Denisovans (theorized based on genetic studies, handful of fossil fragments)

### Early Depictions
 - 1908, most complete Neanderthal skeleton ever recovered (La Chapelle-aux-Saints, France) analyzed by Marcellin Boule
 - Opinion: Neanderthals were a degenerate side branch of human evolution
	 - Artistic depictions: hairy, stooped, dim-witted, violent
	 - Ignored effects of arthritis, other pathologies on the posture of his specimen
		 - No longer have these opinions
 - Reality: They were an enigma, how human were they? society? culture? language? religion?
	 - How did they go extinct when we are less physically robust

### Neanderthal Facts
 - Brains ranged from 1100-1700 cc (modern human range)
	 - Projecting faces, elongated skulls
	 - Most were more muscular than modern humans, also shorter
 - Oldest clear Neanderthal fossil is from Biache-Sant-Vasst (France), 175 kya
	 - Possible older find from Germany 250 kya
 - Most recent Neanderthals: Spain, Mezmaiskaya Cave (Russia) dating 30 kya
 - Lived through two complete glacial cycles with particularly rapid cooling, changing environmental conditions

### Homo Sapiens Neanderthalensis
 - Evolved from H. erectus populations (possibly H heidelbergensis) on a different continent than H. sapiens
	 - Different adaptations
	 - Was there significant gene flow between us and them as they evolved?
		 - If yes, they are a subspecies of H. sapiens, otherwise they are their own species, H. neanderthalensis
 - Recent genetic studies: Neanderthals and Denisovans are cousins, distinct species from H. sapiens
	 - All non-sub-Saharan H. sapiens have some Neanderthal DNA
 - No Neanderthal fossils have been found south of Saudi Arabia or in Egypt

### Denisovans
 - 1999, Neanderthal fossil with preserved bone tissue had mitochondrial DNA extracted
	 - 62250 base pairs of their genome was extracted
	 - Estimated our last common ancestor lived 700-500  kya
 - 2008, fossil finger bone found in Denisova cave in Russia, 75-51 kya, with preserved bone tissue
	 - Extracted, found to be genetically distinct from Neanderthals and H. Sapiens
 - One study: Denisovans may have a common ancestor with humans, Neanderthals from 1.3 mya to 780 kya
	 - Distinct migration of H. erectus out of Africa?
 - Other study: Denisovans, Neanderthals split from humans 800 kya, from each other 640 kya
	 - All evolved together out of H. heidelbergensis, went in separate directions

### Denisovan Evidence
 - Very little physical evidence
	 - One finger bone, three teeth, a leg bone fragment, partial mandible, and another tooth
 - Denisovans, Neanderthals, H. Sapiens all had different teeth
	 - Suggests physical differences
	 - Denisova 11 bone fragment looks like a Neanderthal and Denisovan hybrid
		 - DNA sequence from Denisovan cave suggests a female Neanderthal
		 - Suggests these two hominins were contact, could produce offspring

### Living in Ice Age
 - Pleistocene climate always cycling between glacial and interglacial periods
 - River mouths and land bridges flooded, rivers slowed, trees spread from the south to the north
	 - Spread of vegetation helped soils form, landscapes became stabilized
 - Cold adapted animals moved north, woodland animal communities of elephants, boar, deer developed all over the northern hemisphere

### How Many Glacial Cycles?
 - Surficial evidence like moraine formation, scouring of valleys due to glacial advance + retreat
 - Problem, can't date periods of glacial advance and retreat on surficial evidence alone
 - Older events may be distorted by more recent events
 - Other forms of terrestrial evidence includes stratigraphy, alternation of soil and loess deposits
	 - Can't date them very well unless there is volcanic activity, other processes may have masked or translated deposits
 - Terrestrial evidence = not awesome, much better to use deep sea record
	 - Deep sea deposits have a record on sea surface temperatures recorded in types and chemical composition of animal shells
	 - As surface temperature changed, species of shellfish changed along with the oxygen isotope ratio in their shells
		 - Colder Climate -> Higher Ratio of 18O to 16O
		 - Warmer Climate -> Lower Ratio of 18O to 16O
	 - Results of oxygen isotope curve are consistent worldwide
		 - 30 glacial/interglacial cycles in the Pleistocene
		 - Average of 50k years per cycle, increased over time, last cycle was 100k years
		 - True interglacials lasted about 10-13k years

### Mousterian Industry
 - Neanderthals rarely made handaxes, when they did they were much smaller than Acheulean
	 - After being used for over 1m years, rapidly disappear from 200 kya
 - Most common stone tools from Middle Paleolithic are part of the Mousterian industry
	 - Based primarily on the use of flake tools produced using prepared-core technology
 - Lower Paleolithic known for uniformity in tool forms
	 - Great diversity, standardization of Middle Paleolithic flake tools suggest Neanderthals had equally standardized, complex subsistence economy
 - Debate about the diversity in stone tools

### Francois Bordes
 - 1961, Francois Bordes came up with typology of Mousterian tools
	 - Claimed there were 5 different types of toolkits based on recurring artifact combinations
	 - Stratigraphic relationships between layers on a single site was less important than the artifacts found in them
 - Interpreted these toolkits represented different Neanderthal social groups, tribes, maybe ethnicities
	 - Each tribe had different ways of making tools, different cultural traditions passed on generations

### Frison Effect
 - Lots of disagreement followed
 - Lewis Binford: These toolkits don't represent cultural groups but functional ones. Different kits were developed and used for different tasks
 - Paul Mellars: These toolkits were not contemporary through time, instead followed each other over time. The stratigraphic record of these sites needed to be recognized
 - Over lifetime of use, stone tool gets constantly resharpened and becomes smaller
	 - This reduction in size: Frison effect
	 - Know today that Mousterian flakes were made in two general ways, disc-shaped cores or Levallois technique

### Disc-Shaped Cores
 - Neanderthals had a 'prepared-core' technology for producing flake tools
	 - Disc-shaped cores were the easier variety
 - Flakes are struck off cores radially, around the circumference of the rock. As this is done over and over again, core gets flatter and looks like a disc
 - Simple technique that doesn't require much modification to the core

### Levallois Technique
 - More complex, allow the flintknapper to better determine the size of flakes
 - Purpose is to take off a single sharp thin flake that can then be used to make additional tools of generally similar sizes
 - After the flakes are removed they are further reduced into a series of desired shapes
 - Key point: A nodule is prepared with the purpose of removing a single flake which is then reduced further
 - All these flake tools are further sharpened through retouched, becomes more regularly used in this period (Frisson effect)

### Concluding the Mousterian Toolkit Debate
 - Led to lots of work in ethnoarchaeological studies of living hunter-gatherers, microscopic analysis of stone tool usewear, experimental replication of stone tool manufacture and use, analysis of raw material sources
 - Conclusions:
1. Middle Paleolithic stone technology was variable all over the continent
2. Flakes were made with a variety of techniques, some with advanced planning
3. Manufacturing decisions were situational (environment, food source, stone proximity)
4. Some stylistic features are evident (leaf-shaped points), might represent cultural areas in the landscape
5. Unlikely tools were primary cultural markers between groups, high functional constraints and probably weren't displayed. Cultural markers were more likely clothing or body paint

### Other Mousterian Materials
 - Stone age as stone preserves very well, used frequently
 - Studies of Neanderthal teeth shows scratches were formed from holding stone tools in their mouths
	 - Presumably for freeing their hands for other tasks
 - Other materials were also important
	 - Shoningen spears dated to this period, might have been used by Neanderthals instead of H. erectus
	 - Most microscopic wear analysis on stone tools show evidence for woodworking
		 - Wood was also important for fuel
 - Various evidence for hide-working, use of furs, mineral pigment (ochre) for dying, body paint, ritual, and use of coal for fire
 - Bone, also as fuel, may have been used for tools
	 - Don't see this for sure until H. sapiens
