### La Borde, France
 - If Neanderthals were scavengers, does this mean they were solitary (or small groups), devoid of anything resembling culture
 - 1971,farmer dug out a 100 sq m pit, found many bones
	 - Site in a sinkhole, eventually absorbed into limestone and buried
	 - All archaeological materials (bones, stone tools) found in 55cm thick gravel layer
	 - Pollen samples suggest environment was an open parkland of grasses and herbs, with pine and berch trees
	 - Likely settled by Neanderthals during last major interglacial, perhaps interstadial
 - Thousands of bones found, most were too fragmented to be identified
 - 93% of identified bones were from at least 40 aurochs (wild cattle)
	 - All age groups were represented, some bones being burned, most showing signs of being cracked open for marrow
 - Over 2800 lithic artifacts were found
	 - 96.5% were made of local quartz, simple flake tools, disc-shaped cores
	 - 3.5% were flint from 50 km away, worked elsewhere using Levallois technique
 - Sinkhole repeatedly visited by small groups of Neanderthals at different times of the year
	 - Used it as a trap, drove cattle into it and killed them from above
	 - Also a short-term camp where the animals were butchered and eaten
	 - No evidence for food storage, would have provided a ton of meat. Looks like this was a group of hunters who were sharing, not scavengers

### Middle Paleolithic Subsistence
 - Attempt to understand what Neanderthals ate, how they got food, how modern they were compared to us
 - Their economis were diverse:
	 - Larger animals dominated their assemblages (mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, bison, aurochs, etc)
	 - Other sites show they also ate hares, marmots, birds, fish, shellfish (marine resources otherwise very rare)
 - Looks like they used several habitats at once, adjusting foraging strategies and behaviours depending on what ecosystems were nearby
 - Could produce fire, used it prolifically for cooking. Hearths found at many sites

### Neanderthal the Hunter
 - Hunting needed the right tools, planning, some degree of cooperation
	 - Major tool was the thrusting spear with fire hardened or stone tips
	 - Many Neanderthal skeletons show evidence of fractured bones, dangerous lives
 - Both solitary and collective hunting occurs
	 - Driving animals off cliffs at communal kill sites
 - Hunting herds means there was a seasonality to Neanderthal hunting, practices changed over the year
	 - Also changes in their animal prey due to changing environment after the last interglacial (130-115 kya, forest to tundra)
	 - Also evidence for overexploitation in terms of easily-captured tortoises, shellfish
 - Animals butchered on-site with choppers, portions of meat carried back to camps where it was cooked in hearths
	 - Little evidence for food storage, hunting + butchering must have been constant

### Neanderthal the Scavenger
 - Hunting requires searching, pursuit, capture. Characteristics that are modern and complex
 - If scavenging had an inportant role we'd expect to see:
	 - Diversity of species represented
	 - Lots of very old and very young animals
	 - Lots of bones from parts with little meat
	 - Presence of tooth marks on the bones
 - Evidence suggests they had a preference for larger prey over others, must have hunted them specifically
 - Scavenging played a role but hunting was the main contributor of food
	 - Specifically carnivorous, little plant resources in the tundra of glacial Europe

### Isotope Analysis
 - Bone and dental chemistry determined largely by our diets, can only detect it if the food has a particular chemical signature
	 - Relative frequency of two isotopes of the same elements
	 - Ratio of 13C to 12C in trees and shrubs (low) is different than tropical grasses (high)
	 - Ratio of 15N differs between animals (high) and plants (low)
 - Can use oxygen isotope ratios in teeth to track movement of people
	 - Adult teeth mineralize at 13 years, oxygen isotope ratio of local water consumed as child is recorded in teeth
		 - If we know the ratio of an area we can tell if buried individuals grew up there or not
		 - If we know the ratio in regional ground water we can determine if they died in one area but grew up in another

### Cannibalism
 - Many Neanderthal bones appear mixed in with animal bones, were they food or did they die of natural causes?
 - Evidence from Moula-Guercy cave in France: Cannibalism occurred
	 - Human bones found scattered among bones of other animals in the same location
	 - Bore cut marks in locations appropriate for removal of meat, tendons
	 - Pattern of cut mark location mirrored that on deer bones
	 - Many of the bones, both human and deer, broken in a way that marrow or brains were exposed
	 - Evidence of impact points at many of the breaks, single sharp blows rather than crushing pressure

### Settlement and Movement
 - Most settlements were simple hearths in open spaces or in caves
	 - Some evidence for dry-stone walls in caves (French cave of Moula-Gurecy) and mammoth bones as tent foundations (Moldova) but these are rare and ambiguous
	 - Most sites are scattered lithics and bones around hearths
 - Suggests they are highly mobile, lacked complex social structures
 - Settlements appear to be sited to access multiple habitats
	 - In lowlands to protect from wind
	 - Procured items within 20 km of their camps, no evidence for systematic exchange
	 - Were they to exploit different ecosystems?
 - Cave sites more common in the early last Glacial period when it was colder, compared to earlier warm interglacial period
 - Site locations clearly changed with climate

### Burials, Ritual, Art
 - Older studies claimed evidence for burial and ritual
 - Most of this work has been criticized, shown to be evidence of natural processes, although they still sometimes buried their dead
	 - Complete skeletons in square-cut flat-bottomed earthen pits without grave goods
	 - Sanidar Cave, Iraq: Evidence suggests 4 Neanderthals buried with an assortment of flowers
 - True for art too: Lots of purported evidence for art but much has been reinterpreted as natural processes
	 - Some examples exist (doodling with raptor talons) but they don't suggest symbolic meaning (no repeated patterns)

### Neanderthal Society
 - Lived in a series of base camps like modern hunter-gatherers in societies characterized by sharing
	 - Small and isolated groups, maybe 10-20 people max
 - No evidence for markers of status, wealth, or any kind of ritual
 - Some reverence for the dead, also cannibalism
 - Can say nothing about gender, social hierarchy
 - Lots about stone tool manufacture and that its knowledge was passed through generations
 - Occupation sites are small, show intense activity including hunting and eating

### H. Sapiens
 - Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH)
 - Very low genetic variation, most variation is within groups rather than between them
	 - All have recent common ancestry
 - Big brain (1200-1700 cc), globular braincase, vertical forehead, reduced brow, pronounced chin, smaller teeth, reduced body mass, narrow trunk
 - First appear in Africe 300-100 kya
	 - Jebel Irhoud, Morocco: Earliest H. sapiens fossils <- most important
	 - Herto, Ethiopia: Complete skull with human features dating 160 kya
	 - Klasies River Mouth and Border Cave, South Africa: Fossils including skull, jaw, arm, foot, dating 120-70 kya
	 - All in range of H. sapiens characteristics
 - Our first journey was to colonize Africa

### African Middle Stone Age Industries
 - Acheulean industries replaced between 300 and 200 kya by the Middle Stone Age industries in Africa
	 - Lasted until around 40 kya
 - Some stone tools of the Middle Stone Age look very similar to Middle Paleolithic (Mousterian) Neanderthal tools
	 - Levallois technique also used in Africa
 - Much regional variation:
	 - The Aterian: North African industries that produced projectile points with a tang to secure it to a spear
	 - The Sangoan/Lupemban: Central, East African industries that made crude heavy duty tools, useful in heavy wooded environments
	 - The Howiesons Poort: South African industry with small crescent-shaped microliths (tiny stone tools) that may have been part of composite tools

### The First Bone Tools
 - Site of Katanda overlooking the Semliki River in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been dated to before 75 kya
	 - Stone tools all appear to be Middle Stone Age, resembling Sangoan lithics
 - Also found 10 barbed stone projectile points, few smaller unbarbed points, part of a bone knife
	 - Oldest bone tools in the world, the points were likely hafted onto spears
 - Total of 21 bone tools found in South Africa at Blombos Cave
	 - Include 2 projectile points, several bone awls (used as perforators for hides or leather)
	 - These H. sapiens were probably making their own clothing

### Middle Stone Age Subsistence
 - Like Neanderthals, evidence for large game hunting among early African H. sapiens
	 - Klasies River Mouth: Bovid vertebrae found with stone tool embedded
 - Unlike Neanderthals, also at Klasies River Mouth, lots of shellfish and seal bones were found
	 - Exploiting marine resources
	 - Katanda site: Huge catfish (over 35 kg) were fished (bone hooks?) and eaten
	 - Pinnacle Point, South Africa: Mollusks were eaten maybe 160 kya
 - Plants were also consumed
	 - Border Cave, plant remains of Hypoxis augustifolia were found in ash deposits 170 kya
		 - Plant with edible root when cooked, very nutritious
 - Why expand food sources? Might be related to glacial conditions of Oxygen Isotope Stage 6

### Middle Stone Age Art or Symbols?
 - Blombos Cave, South Africa, earliest evidence of hominins marking a pattern anywhere in the world
	 - Piece of ochre (soft red iron rock) was decorated with incised lines
	 - 13 other pieces are known dating back 100 kya, along with stone tools for processing ochre into powder and shells to store it
	 - Pierced shells also found here, beads?
 - Symbolic behaviour: Artifacts meant to represent something
 - Artwork: Incisions are meant to be aesthetically pleasing
 - Are these symbols or art?
 - Ochre is used in ritual, ceremonial contexts later. Did it start here?

### Africa vs Europe
 - Early H. sapiens were clearly similar, also very different from contemporary Neanderthals in Europe
 - Similarities:
	 - Most stone tools made with prepared-core technique
	 - Variability between stone tool industries
	 - Hunting and using fire were common
 - Differences:
	 - Greater variability between industries in Africa than Europe
	 - Middle Stone Age H. sapiens used bone tools and fished, Neanderthals did not
	 - Some evidence for artwork/symbolism in Africa, none from the European Middle Paleolithic
