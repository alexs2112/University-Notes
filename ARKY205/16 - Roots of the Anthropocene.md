### The Holocene
 - End of Pleistocene, Holocene began around 11,700 BP (9700 BCE) after the Last Glacial Period
	 - Pleistocene aka the Great Ice Age
 - Holocene: 11700 BP to present, a much more stable and warm period with different animal populations
	 - Some claim we are just in an interglacial of the Pleistocene

### The Age of H. Sapiens
 - Last 12k years, fastest and most transformative changes in the history of H.sapiens
 - H. erectus used Acheulean handaxes for around 1.5 million years
 - In the span of around 3000 years H. sapiens:
	 - Invented agriculture and domesticated aspects of the natural world (plants, animals)
	 - Created social structures that would allow us to live in increasingly larger and more complex groups, leading to urbanization
	 - These two developments (gradual revolutions) were necessary preconditions for the complexity of ancient civilizations around the world
 - Two main requirements for complex society in most archaeological prehistoric narratives:
	 - Agricultural surplus
	 - Social differentiation
 - To achieve these two conditions, have to make some modifications to the natural world:
	 - Greater exploitation and modification, increasingly impacted our environments
	 - Most impactful period: Last 200 (or 70) years
	 - Estimated 95% of Earth's surface has some form of human modification, 85% has multiple forms of impact

### Anthropocene
 - New term for our current geological epoch
 - Age where people began to actively and consciously change the global environment (land, climate)
 - Originally: Started with origins of great agricultural societies. Relatively high impact compared to Paleolithic but nothing compared to early modern societies and industrial revolution
 - Today: Suggest Anthropocene begins with the nuclear revolution in the 1950s prior to the Great Acceleration
 - Roots of the Anthropocene:
	 - Biological evolutionary development of our physical form
	 - Period when our brains and intellectual capacity reached current levels
	 - Development of complex social forms representing modernity

### Physical Origins of Humans
 - Human physiology hasn't changed much since our earliest emergence in Africa
 - Cro-Magnon 1, early H. sapiens skull found in rock shelter in SW France
	 - Since this, numerous other examples that show some variation in H. sapiens skeletons, all within a range of diversity narrower than humans today
 - We are, on average, more gracile (thinner and taller) than early humans
	 - Early: More robust, bigger teeth, prominent brows, broader faces
 - Doesn't appear to be a link between becoming anatomically modern and any significant geological-scale changes that could characterise the Anthropocene
	 - Physical forms clearly at the roots of the Anthropocene, only members of the Homo genus still on the planet
 - Lifeways and physiology helped us survive as the megafauna went extinct, other Homos also existed but did not survive for long
 - Roots of the Anthropocene are fully human, not just to physical form but due to our brains

### Origins of the Human Brain
 - Brain size can predict cognitive ability, larger brains correlate with problem solving success in mammals
 - Brain size rapidlyy increased from 800-200 kya during the period of most intense climate fluctuation for the whole Pleistocene
 - Brains have become slightly larger and more globular over the last 300k years
	 - Current brain shape appeared between 100-35 kya (start of upper Paleolithic)
 - Rapid brain size increase occurred with Neanderthals living in Europe
	 - Little about society that is particularly modern
 - Modern human brain sizes common in H. sapiens when we first emerged 300 kya in Africa
	 - 100 kya used bone tools instead of only stone
	 - Interest in jewelry, some early aesthetic art and symbolism
 - When H. sapiens brains became more globular in shape our activities appear very modern
	 - Believe those alive during the Upper Paleolithic had the exact same cognitive ability as us

### Language
 - Origins for human language heavily debated, no direct evidence for it
 - Differene between having a language-ready brain and the availability of a linguistic code
	 - Requires certain cortical mass to express thoughts and complex concepts
 - Once this mass is reached, hominins needed two genes to help in cortical reorganization of our brains
	 - ARHGAP11B: Split from chimpanzee common ancestor
	 - SRGAP2: Mutating around 3 mya, main driver in neocortical evolution
 - These two genes were required before language could develop, began 3 mya
	 - No reason why Neanderthals, Denisovans, early H. sapiens could not have language
 - Also need the throat for language
	 - Physiology of Australopithecines resemble modern chimps, could not vocalize beyond hooting
 - H. erectus, likely they had the capacity to make a range of sounds that have meanings
 - Standardized toolmaking is a sign of language and an awareness of icons
	 - Explains great similarity between stone tools identified over the years across great distances

### Evidence for Writing
 - Phenology: Seasonal biological events in plant and animal species
 - Set of abstract marks long identified at several Upper Paleolithic cave painting sites between 37-13 kBP
	 - Non-figurative signs, dots, lines, Ys, often found with prey animal depictions
	 - Regularity of these marks seemingly represent some sort of artificial or external memory system
 - Dependent on hunting game with annual cycles of mating and birthing separated by migrations
 - Hypothesis these marks represent lunar months that convey important information of each species
	 - Number of lunar months after spring when each species enters either mating or birthing phases
	 - Tracking movements of these animals made more predictable, conveying information about yearly behaviour
 - Not necessarily representing a language, conveys information symbolically that would have been known to the people reading it

### Summarizing the Paleolithic Brain
 - Cognitive Revolution required
 - As soon as our brains looked modern we started doing more modern things
 - Upper Paleolithic an important period for the development of human modernity
	 - Clothes, Jewelry, Burying the dead, Expansive trade, Sophisticated tools, Spectacular artwork
	 - Cognitive ability for language
	 - At least one written script to convey specific information
 - Upper Paleolithic the period in which the origins of the Anthropocene are clearest

### Modern Social Structures
 - Why do writers continue to compare hunter-gatherers and foragers to apes, instead of modern hunter-gatherers?
 - Western economic and intellectual traditions are incapable of considering prehistoric peoples as complex
	 - Actively denigrated indigenous perspectives on social organization in the 18th, 19th centuries
	 - Western ideals of individualism, social differentiation + inequality, rampant consumption and consumerism, general political illiteracy
		 - Made to seem inevitable and superior to all other ways of life
 - Reality: Indigenous cultures all over the world have repeatedly demonstrated incredible variation in social forms that makes western categories of social progress meaningless
 - Need to get more creative when thinking of paleolithic social organization, stop relying on categories created to imply our way is the pinnacle of human society
