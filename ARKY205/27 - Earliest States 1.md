# Egypt and Mesopotamia
### Epic of Gilgamesh
 - One of the oldest texts in the world (Third Dynasty of Ur, 2100 BCE)
	 - Recounts deeds of heroic King of Uruk who rules in the Early Dynastic Period (2900-2350 BCE)
	 - Five poems telling story of his search for the source of eternal life, finds and loses immortality plant, come to terms with his mortality
 - Archaeological Questions: Did Uruk need Gilgamesh to rule it? Or did Gilgamesh need a city like Uruk to be king
	 - Did Uruk become complex and urban because of an administrator, or did administration emerge after

### Mesopotamia
 - Heartland of Mesopotamia began in southern Iraq before the Tigris and Euphrates rivers drain into Arabian Gulf
 - Three important consequences of this location:
	 - Many early sites buried deep under river silts
	 - No mineral resources here, only good building materials are reeds and mud
	 - Soils here were very fertile
 - Unlike Neolithic Egypt: Soils needed irrigation, dry farming was impossible
 - 3000 BCE: Desert cities of today were at the edges of extensive marshlands
	 - Early famers caused salination of this landscape through continuous intensive agriculture, crops no longer grow here

### 'Ubaid Origins
 - First good evidence for farming around 6000 BCE ('Ubaid Period: 6500-3700 BCE)
	 - Canals for diverting river waters to irrigate fields and prevent salt buildup
 - Largest cluster of these farming communities housed 2500-4000 people
	 - Substantial buildings, alleys, courtyards, complex irrigation
 - Digging canals required no political or social leadership, did require communal effort to dig and maintain them

### Eridu - The First City?
 - Founded as early as 5400 BCE, different forms of occupation up to 2500 BCE
 - Ancient Sumerians called it the first city, archaeologically more of a small village
 - Founded at the confluence of three ecosystems for fisher-hunters, agriculturalists, nomad hunter-gatherers
	 - Core of the site: Shrine with altar and offering table with hundreds of fish bones
 - Earliest levels show no evidence for centralized government or any rulers
	 - Started as a shrine, different groups merged to live communally and share resources
 - Point: Monumental buildings indicating rulers do not appear until 4000-3800 BCE, millenia after founding

### Uruk - The First City
 - Began in the 'Ubaid period as two small towns on opposite banks of a small channel of the Euphrates
 - Over Uruk period (4000-2900 BCE), grew to 2.5 km squared with population up to 40k
 - Two massive temple precincts in middle of the city
	 - Limestone temples (imported) built on massive mudbrick platforms (precursors to ziggurats)
 - **Government**:
	 - Around 4000-3500 BCE, most large buildings were communal assembly halls
	 - Earlier interpretation: Paramount ruler managed the temple and assembly halls, ruled over Uruk with complex hierarchy of priests, minor officials, wealthy landowners, merchants
	 - Problem: We have no evidence for this until after 3500 BCE, don't know how government worked in early Uruk, maybe like democratic Athens?
		 - Point: Sumerian civilization emerged without a king or obvious ruler
 - **State**:
	 - 3500 BCE: Uruk had an elaborate management system including law, punishment, policy decisions
		 - Three sources of authority (order of importance): Temple, Palace, City Council
	 - Chief priest of the temple ruled the city, palace leader/king (ensi) maintained the temple and military
		 - Likely king selected by city council
	 - Influence of Uruk in Mesopotamia grew rapidly thanks to two factors: Writing and Metallurgy

### Cuneiform and Bronze
 - Earliest writing predates Uruk by millenia: Small clay seals with images of food products as early as 8000 BCE
 - First conventionalized language around 3500 BCE: Cuneiform
	 - Besides cuneiform: Cylinder Seals also appeared in Uruk period
 - Mesopotamia had no minerals: Sumerians at Uruk imported copper, gold, other ores from Iranian highlands as early as 3500 BCE
	 - Often known as the start of the Bronze Age (3000 BCE)
	 - Most archaeologists refer to this earlier period as the Chalcolithic or the Copper Age

### Early Dynastic Period
 - Growth of early Mesopotamian cities based on agricultural surplus, therefore irrigation
 - By 3000 BCE: Clear differences in wealth and privilege emerge
	 - Royal Tombs at Ur (1920s, Leonard Woolley), staggering amount of wealth buried with early royalty
 - Present with the tombs: Death Pits
	 - Dozens of men, women, oxen, carts, all ritualistically killed as part of burial rites of the royalty
 - How did the kings come to hold so much power and wealth in Sumerian society

### Sumerian Colonization
 - Wealth at Ur suggests Early Dynastic period saw militarized society
	 - Walled cities, texts speak of war, weapons of war were limited (axes, spears, arrows)
 - Find Uruk colonies all over SW Asia
	 - Maybe Uruk was sending out commercial ventures to control trade routes, make it easier to import precious metals and other critical resources
 - Early Sumerian civilization was dynamic from the power of individual cities and their trading relationships

### Predynastic Egypt
 - Around 5000 BCE: Nile supported a patchwork of simple village farming communities
 - Around 4000 BCE: Autonomous communities with strong ties to their landscape, begin to compete and trade with neighbours more intensively
 - Key to ideology: Reliance on the Nile
	 - Charismatic leaders took advantage of this to justify things like conquest over neighbours
 - **First Unification**:
	 - Quick and complex consolidation of power after 4000 BCE
	 - By 3500 BCE: Three Kingdoms dominated the Nile: Nagada, Nekhen, This (Abydos)
		 - Nuclei of a later unified Egypt
	 - Kingdoms of Upper Egypt had direct contact with Mesopotamia (Sumerian artifacts on Egyptian sites)
		 - Led to conflict, the richer, more complex Nekhen kingdom prevailed
		 - Began military conquest of the Nile between the Mediterranean and Aswan
	 - Unification was a process that took centuries
		 - 3100 BCE: Upper and Lower Egypt joined along with symbolic linking of gods Horus and Seth

### Dynasties
 - Earliest evidence for a single ruler of Egypt comes from the Narmer Palette (Nekhen)
	 - Pot shaped flat tablet, on one side King Narmer wears white conical crown of Upper Egypt, on the other side he wears the red crown of Lower Egypt
 - Classical historian Manethos in 300 BCE compiled these dynastic lists grouped into kingdoms (political unity, order) and intermediate periods (political fragmentation, chaos)
	 - For millenia: Egyption society concerned by world torn between order and chaos
 - Solution: Kingship prevented chaos using the power of the sun (Ra) to presever rightness (ma'at)
	 - Their view of the universe coincided with centralized political power

### Early Dynastic Egypt
 - First Dynastic ruler of Egypt was Horus Aha (3000 BCE)
	 - Next 400 years: Process of consolidations as pharaohs emerged as divine kings
	 - Royal tradition, writing and art to legitimize centralized administration
	 - Beginning of Egypts "Great Culture"
 - Complex system of writing, hieroglyphs, developed out of predynastic artistic symbols around 3200 BCE
 - Unlike Mesopotamia: Clearer picture of daily life for Egyptions
	 - Tombs painted with depictions of daily life meant to provide for the deceased in the afterlife
 - Essential family unitw as the extended family, state didn't eliminate social organization based on kin
 - Bureaucracy is hard to see archaeologically, good example is unfinished chamber beneath Pyramid of Khufu
	 - As it was being quarried, work suddenly stopped
	 - Hammer blows still visible showing two sets of two teams, large scale projects done in teams of two

### Development of Mortuary Architecture
 - Most famous monuments of Old Kingdom Egypt: Pyramids
	 - Temples for deceased kings who (after death) become incarnations of the god Osiris
 - Veneration of the kings required the body to be preserved and the tomb be filled with provisions for the afterlife
 - Not cores of settlement: Unique and distinct centers of power
 - Earliest royal tomb known is Tomb 100 from Nekhen (end of Predynastic period)
	 - Mud brick structure of crude wall paintings with crude wall paintings of a person smiting an enemy
 - During First and Second Dynasties: Royal burial ground moved to Abydos, also simple buried mud brick chambers
 - Interesting: Excavations at tomb of King Aha show the enclosure was purposefully destroyed after it was built
	 - Numerous burials with evidence for sacrifice around the enclosure
	 - Also fleet of buried boats to carry the king into the afterlife
	 - Interpretation: Courts of the king were being ritually sacrificed upon his death, created a sense of kinship between Egyption elites and the divine ruler
 - Third Dynasty: Royal burial moved to **Saqqara**, near modern Cairo
	 - Monumental structure, stepped pyramid, built by King Djoser (2668-2649 BCE)
	 - Engravings at Djoser complex show the Sed festival, important ritual of renewal run by the king through performance to help maintain order in the world
 - **First True Pyramids**:
	 - King Snefru of the Fourth Dynasty (2600 BCE) was responsible for the first true pyramid
	 - Construction attempted three times before succeeding:
		 - Broken pyramid at Meydum collapsed during construction
		 - Bent pyramid at Dahshur had slope for 60* for the bottom half, 44* for the top half
		 - Successful attempt: Red Pyramid at Dahshur, 105m high
	 - Pyramid building reached its apex during the Fourth Dynasty with Khufu/Cheops, Khafre, Menkaura, who built their tombs at Giza
		 - Pyramid of Khufu: Largest over built (irony: our only depiction of Cheops is an 8cm statue)
		 - Great Sphinx: Carved out of limestone bedrock during reign of Khafre
 - **Pyramids and the State**:
	 - Giza Pyramids: Made the power of the king and state a real part of the alndscape
	 - However construction of the pyramid was an immense undertaking, needed to mobilize a huge workforce
	 - Excavation of the Spinx provides clues: Discovery of ancient breweries and bakeries south of the pyramid
		 - People were paid in food and drink to work, others paid to provide food

### Egyptian (non) Cities
 - Complexity of Old Kingdom Egypt was staggering, unlike the Sumerians the core of early Egyptian state was not an urban center
 - Largest settlements from Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom were large towns or villages, not cities
 - Earliest city we have: Amarna, capital of Akhenaten (1363-1347 BCE) in the New Kingdom period

### Egypt and Mesopotamia Compared
 - Biggest difference: Mesopotamian civilization was founded on urban culture, whereas Egyptian civilization sought legitimacy from funerary monuments of its kings
 - Egypt: Rituals of kingly death helped reinforce kinship amongst the ruling class, required a producing class (peasantry?) to provide foodstuffs for the afterlife
	 - All classes tried to imitate royal burial on smaller scales
	 - Created network of obligations and debt, class distinctions emerge
 - Mesopotamia: Early forms of the state were centered in urban spaces with no obvious rulers
	 - Instead appears tohave tradition of communal labour + ritual, forming complex state before kings arrive
 - Point: Emergence of the state will be slightly different everywhere
