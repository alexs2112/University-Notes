### Neanderthal activity and resting areas from stratigraphic unit 13 at the Middle Palaeolithic site of Oscurusciuto (Ginosa - Taranto, Southern Italy)
 - Palimpsest: manuscript, original writing removed to make room for new writing, traces remain
 - Found Mousterian Palimpset, integrating study of lithic finds, faunal remains, microarchaeology of combustion features
 - Results:
	 - Neanderthal site as tripartite location, spatially segregated and integrated activity areas
	 - Hearth's alignment (parallel to rockshelter wall) divides area into inner and outer part
	 - Inner part: possible sleeping/resting area
	 - Northern part: Devoted to lithic production (producing stone tools from rocks)
	 - Southern part: More intensive production, use of lithic tools, butchering and consumption of animal resources
		 - Evidence of space maintenance behaviour (cleaning space, refuse dumping)
 - Bottom of the sequence lies on top of sterile volcanic ash layer
	 - Several living floors identified
	 - Faunal remains, lithic assemblages were studied
	 - Purpose: understand management of the site space, functional interpretation of different areas
 - Approach:
	 - First studied lithic finds, faunal remains, hearths
	 - Second integrate data with GIS platform, studied with visual, statistical methods

### Combustion Structures:
 - Eight hearths with diameters of 20-34 cm, with one big one (80 cm)
 - Shallow pits with a flat bottom and a bowl shape section
 - Distributed along a NE to SW band, constituting a boundary that divides the area into an inner and outer sector

### Materials and Methods
 - Analysis of Combustion Features:
	 - Gain information of fuel composition, combustion composition, preservation state of hearths
	 - Intact sediment blocks collected, embedded with polyester resin and processed into thin sections
		 - Analyzed by petrographic microscopy
	 - Results: 
		 - Suggestion of several fuel loads being used, exiguous fuel
		 - Short-lived hearths, refuelled frequently but did not last long. Wood was the main fuel used
 - Spatial Analysis:
	 - Data selected based on three main grades of visibility:
		 - Direct correspondence between actual actiity area and spatial distribution of correlated finds
		 - Same as above, but with partial but low level alteration of the area (cleaning, scuffing, digging, etc)
		 - No correspondance between activity areas and correlated finds
