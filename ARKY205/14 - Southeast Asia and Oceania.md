### Modern Humans in India
 - Dhaba on Son River in Nothern India: Southern Arc movement of people out of the Middle East
 - Important bridge linking stone tool continuity between Africa and Australia between 80-48 kya

### Modern Humans in East Asia
 - Archaeological Evidence for H. Erectus in China and Java, don't know much about the coming of H. sapiens
	 - Fossils from Lingjing, Henan proince: Show increase in brain size and stone tools
 - Don't know how modern humans interacted in East Asia

### Modern Humans in Southeast Asia
 - Ngandong, Java: Mix of attributes present at Lingjing
 - Some H. erectus populations persisted for a very long time in SE Asia
 - Hominins from Lingjing overlapped with true H.erectus on Java
 - Cave paintings on Borneo and Indonesia contained rock art of animal and human figures
	 - No known archaeological contexts to guess who made it
	 - Earliest figurative representations in the world

### Hand Stencil Art
 - Placing hand on rock surface, blowing wet pigment over it to trace the shape in negative
 - Hand stencil art in Sulawesi, Indonesia: 39.9 kya and 35.4 kya, likely oldest figural art in the world

### Getting to Australia
 - During glacial advance, sea levels were low, Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea were all connected in landmass called Sahul
 - Same further north:  Southeast Asia including Vietname, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia made a landmass called Sunda
 - String of islands between Sunda and Sahul called Wallacea, channels are too deep to connect them
	 - Wallace Line separates unique animals and plants of Australia from those of Southeast Asia
	 - Crossing this line was necessary for early human ancestors

### First Hominines in Wallacea
 - Stone tools found on the island of Flores in Wallacea suggests H. erectus could cross water between 900-800 kya
 - Boats? Unlikely, they werent the only mammal that arrived during this period
	 - Low sea levels and favourable currents were the most likely solution

### Homo floresiensis
 - Found in Liang Bua Cave
 - Smallest human species known, brain of 380 cc (grapefruit), height of 1.06 m (3'6"), Indonesian Hobbits
 - Not a child or weird genetic condition, at least 5 individuals of the same size discovered
 - So small due to long term isolation of H. erectus populations
	 - Isolated animal populations typically evolve for reduced body size
 - Flake tools with retouch but no standardized forms

### Route to Sahul
 - No evidence H.erectus crossed Wallacea to Sahul, neither did any other mammals from Flores
 - Changed with H.sapiens, two routes possible based on geography:
	 - Northern route along islands between Saluwesi and New Guinea
	 - Southern route along islands between Java and Timor, more direct but 90 km sea crossing
 - Genetic studies suggest single colonization event 50 kya

### Earliest Evidence for Humans in Australia
 - Largest evidence for modern humans in Australia date between 60-53 kya
	 - 10k years before first humans in Europe
 - Stone tools associated with humans found at Jinmium Cave in Arnhem Land, 116 kya
 - Today: Jinmium Cave dates cannot be reproduced, considered unlikely and rejected by most
 - Starting point around 60 kya for for the colonization of Australia is widely accepted and reflected

### Nauwalabila I
 - Rock shelter, Arnhem Land, Northern Australia: 3 m of archaological deposits
 - Soils dated through thermoluminescence, no organic material suitable for radiocarbon dating
	 - Suggest early occupation after 60.3 +- 6.7 kya, before 53.4 +- 5.4 kya
 - Nearby site of Madjedbebe confirms these dates

### Lake Mungo
 - Dried out Willandra lake near Canberra in southern Australia
 - Two human burials, lots of stone tools discovered eroding out of ancient lake shorelines
 - Probably took people around 10k years after arrival to settle around the edge of Lake Mungo on the southern end

### Archaeological Narrative for Settling Australia
 - Current evidence suggests the first people arrived in Australia 60kya, capable of some sea travel likely learned on their multi-generational trek from Africa
 - Problem: How could they get to Australia before entering Europe
	 - What kind of boats did they use? Why did they voyage into unknown lands?

### Megafauna Extinction
 - End of Pleistocene, widespread animal extinction, megafauna were the hardest hit
	 - Did these extinctions occur because of the spread of H. sapiens? Or due to ecological event?
 - Paleontological dating restricted to articulated skeletons, no evidence for human involvement
 - Best evidence: Extinction of Australian megafauna occurred between 50-40 kya, 10-15k after humans
	 - But little evidence for Australians hunting megafauna
 - More likely: Human activity altered the ecology in ways that disrupted highly specialized megafaunal adaptations
	 - Burned brushland to open up woodlands for more grass, easier to hunt kangaroos, detrimental to megafauna

### Later Rock Art
 - Indigenous Australians continued hunter gatherer lifeways until contact with Europeans
 - Highly developed mythological, ritual traditions expressed in artwork
 - Most famous: Ubirr rock shelter in Kakadua National Park, Northern Australia
	 - 2-14 kya, some examples 40 kya

### Moving On
 - Spread of people across Micronesia and Polynesia began 35 kya, likely from New Guinea
 - 29 kya, people on islands not visible from the mainland or any other island, ventured into open sea
 - Masters of seafaring, no evidence for people outside Melanesia until 3500 BCE (Lapita culture)
	 - Why leave Taiwan:
	 - No population pressure, intense rapid colonization beyond growth rates
	 - Social structure included strict rules of inheritence that favoured firstborn children, maybe junior offspring forced to leave home to create their own lineages
 - Last colonized island: New Zealand, 1200 CE
