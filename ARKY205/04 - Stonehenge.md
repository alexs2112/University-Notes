 - Salisbury Plain, southern England
 - Outer ring of vertical sarsen (local) standing stones (4m tall, 2m wide, 25 tons) and horizontal lintels
 - Smaller ring of bluestones (nonlocal) inside the sarsen stone circle
 - In the middle: 5 trilithons arranged in a horseshoe pattern with an altar stone
 - Henge: Neolithic earthwork consisting of a ring-shaped bank and ditch, ditch inside the bank
 - Lots of ditches, mounds, holes. Trying to figure out why they are made and purpose

### Modern History
 - First scientific work in 1666, John Aubrey, recorded series of pits inside the stone circle (Aubrey Holes)
 - 1882, protected monument
 - 1900, storm knocked over a sarsen stone, 1901 restoration work to re-erect or set concrete foundations
 - Purchased in 1915, gifted to English Crown in 1918, managed since then by various national trusts and organizations (English Heritage)

### Past Understandings
 - Roman Times: Diodorus Siculus, round temple to Apollo on Hyperborea (Britannia?)
 - Twelfth century: Geoffrey of Monmouth claims Stonehenge were brought to England from Ireland by Merlin
 - Legend: Stones were brought from Africa to Ireland by giants (Giant's Ring/Round), Merlin sent to gather the stones to make a monument to fallen Celtic nobles slain by invading saxons
	 - Couldn't be moved without giants, Merlin befriended
 - Petrological analysis discovered that the bluestones were transported to Stonehenge from Wales
 - 16th Century: This part of the Salisbury plains were owned by King Henry 8, passed through several royal families until auction in 1915
	 - Lots of infrastructure built up around it
 - 20th Century: Neopagans, neodruids had ceremony in 1905, believing the site was associated with druids as noted by Julius Caesar and Tacitus
 - Recognized early: Associated with the solstices, several years of neopagan festivals ocurring at the site

### Antiquarians at Stonehenge
 - John Aubrey (1626-1697): Concluded that Stonehenge was probably built by native Britons, not Romans, Danes, or Saxons
 - William Stukeley (1687-1765): Measured Stonehenge in 1723, tried to determine who built it by understanding which units of measurement were used in its construction. Discovered astronomical significance, also thought it was built by native Britons
 - William Cunnington (1754-1810): Excavated sites in the nearby landscape, determined it was part of a barrow landscape (funerary monuments from an ancient period before the Romans)
 - Professor William Gowland (1842-1922): Excavated, Restorations 1901, found numerous stone tools, built in the Neolithic period (before metals)
 - Lieutenant-Colonel William Hawley (1851-1941): 1919, excavated all the Aubrey holes outside the standing stones, some contained cremated human bone. Thought the pits were post holes for wooden beams
 - Sir WIlliam Matthew Flinders Petrie (1853-1942): Most accurate surveyed drawing of Stonehenge in 1877, numbered all the stones, still use his system today
 - Maud Cunnington (1869-1951): Excavated nearby site, Durrington Walls. Dark spots on the ground itendified in aerial photographs were concentric rings of post holes enclosed by an earthen bank (**Woodhenge**)
 - Professor Richard Atkinson (1920-1994): Reviewed Hawley's unpublished work 1950, determined new excavations were needed. Discovered double arc of bluestones buried inside the standing stone ring, found Bronze Age artwork etched into a stone
 - Faith Vatcher (1927-1978): Excavated nearby sites, found Mesolithic postholes (8500-7000 BCE) suggesting human activity at the site 4000 years before the stones were raised
 - Professor John Evans (1941-2005): Environmental archaeologist restructuring ancient climate from snail shells, dug a trench across the Stonehenge enclosure ditch and found a burial of a young man with arrows embedded in his bones. Produced the first environmental history of the region

### Current Archaeology
 - 1979 Mike Pitts was curator of nearby museum (Avebury). Saw telephone cable installation was damaging archaeology, conducted rescue excavation, exposing a pit that may have been the original position of the heel stone
 - Radiocarbon expert, Alex Bayliss, new type of statistical analysis on carbon samples to get more precise dates on Stonehenge construction phases.
	 - Change happened very quickly in the Stonehenge landscape in the third millenium BCE
 - Mike Parker Pearson conducted Stonehenge Riverside Project (2005-2009), found seven Neolithic houses at Durrington Wells
	 - Durrington is the area for the living, Stonehenge is the area for the dead
	 - Identified the area in Wales where the bluestones likely originated

### What We Know
 - Excavations inside the bowl of Stonehenge has been ocurring since the 17th century
 - Work between 1900 and today resulted in good chronology for site development
	 - Dating wood and bone samples excavated from hundreds of pits, applying relative dating techniques to any pottery or lithics found within the deposits
 - Chronology:
![[stonehenge_chronology.png|400]]
 - Stage 1:
	 - Earthen embankment surrounding some rectilinear wooden structures, ring of cremation burial deposits
	 - Middle to late Neolithic burial ground
![[stonehenge_stage1.png|400]]
 - Stage 2:
	 - Late Neolithic, monumental Megalithic construction as the sarsen stones were raised and fastened using timber construction techniques (stub-tenons).
	 - Major ceremonial space
![[stonehenge_stage2.png|400]]
 - Stage 5:
	 - Site Covered by pottery sherds of the Beaker people, breaking up the bluestones and using the material for handheld stone tools
	 - The Y and Z holes were left open for an unknown purpose, the rest of the landscape was used extensively for Bronze Age round barrow burials
	 - Ceremonial purpose was gone by the Middle Bronze Age
![[stonehenge_stage5.png|400]]

### Solar Calendar
 - Likely had several purposes, one purpose from stage 2: Solar Calendar
	 - Thousands of megaliths in Europe, only three have known celestial qualities
 - Local innovation of the third millenium BCE? Coincides with increasing interest in solar deities in the Near East and Egypt (365-day calendar was invented in 2773 BCE)
 - Keeping track of time was necessary for farmers to know when to plant and when to harvest
	 - Recent societal shift from hunter gatherers to part-time farmers

### Stonehenge Landscape
 - Part of a larger prehistoric ceremonial landscape dating back to the fourth millenium BCE
 - Black dots: Barrows (Neolithic, Bronze Age)
 - Cursus: 3km-long ditch and bank monument built 3630-3375 BCE, used for ceremonial processions associated with the midsummer sunrise and sunset
 - Durrington Walls: Massive Neolithic settlement. Small in early Neolithic, huge in later Neolithic (2600 BCE) when a huge timber circle (massive post holes) was built at Woodhenge
 - Current theory: Woodhenge is a monument to the living near Durrington Walls, Stonehenge was a monument to the dead

### Stonehenge Avenue
 - Air photos, geophysical prospection identified an earthen avenue linking Stonehenge to River Avon
 - Excavation, avenue was partly natural, partly constructed
	 - Periglacial stripes (soil fissures) would have been noticed by prehistoric people as lines of denser vegetation, coincidentally aligned with the setting and rising of the sun on solstices
 - Excavations at the end of the avenue revealed a buried henge smaller than Stonehenge, series of flat bottomed holes for stones
	 - Grooved Ware pottery and antler picks found within the holes helped date the site, 2460-2210 cal BCE
	 - Pits measured, determined every stonehole once held a bluestone found at Stonehenge
 - The point: Henge dismantled during Stonehenge Stage 3, bluestones were added inside the trilithon horseshoe, no idea why

### Complexity of Stonehenge
 - Archaeology is a slow process, can take work over several generations to provide insights
 - Can accurately date construction phases of the monument
 - Transition between hunter gatherers, farmers (Mesolithic, Neolithic) came with a new religious appreciation for seasonality
 - Prehistoric peoples were capable of constructing enormous ditches and mounds (dug with antler picks, stone hoes) and carving massive stones (stone tools)
 - Site is part of a wider prehistoric landscape of contemporary monuments, change how we perceive Stonehenge and its functions
