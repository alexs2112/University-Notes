# The Americas
### Mysterious Mounds
 - European colonists confused about massive artifical earthwork mounds in North America
 - Old belief: Made by advanced race unrelated to Native Americans that then migrated to Mexico
 - Reality: Made by indigenous groups in social, economic context of emergence of agriculture
 - Surprising thing: Genetic + archaeological evidence suggests domestication started with bottle gourds, floated to Americas from Africa 10k BP

### Origins of Maize
 - Central role in many American farming communities over the Holocene
 - Origins: Teosinte, wild grass from highland Mexico (genetic studies)
 - Genetic analysis suggests there was a single original center of domestication in highlands of Mexico

### Mesoamerica
 - Samples from Guila Naquitz in Oaxaca Valley show that squash was the earliest domesticated plant in Mexico (10k-8.3k BP)
	 - Oldest directly dated Maize also comes from here, dated 6250 BP
	 - Tough rachis, were lcearly domesticated
 - Earliest maize from Tehuacan Valley (5500 BP) shows gradual increase in size
 - At Xihuatoxtla Shelter in Guerrero, Mexico, maize starch and phytoliths found on grinding stones
 - Beans and lima beans were domesticated independently in Central and South America

### Peruvian Agriculture
 - **Food Production in the High Andes**:
	 - Perfect example of evolutionary force humans place on plants and animals
		 - Too mountainous for good agriculture land
		 - Lowland areas are harsh and marginal
		 - Solution: Settle in multiple vertical environments by modifying the landscape with terraces, while encouraging different plant and animal species to adapt to new elevations
	 - Result: People here extended range, stil struggled to maintain settlement outside natural faunal and floral ranges
	 - Important early domesticates: Llamas, alpacas, guinea pigs, potatos, quinoa
 - **Staples**:
	 - Great variety of plants and animals in Andean foothills, only a handful were domesticated
	 - European contact in 15th century: Andean farmers used hundreds of potato varieties, wild potatos from the start of human occupation in the highlands, domesticated potato start from 3400 BCE
	 - Like everywhere else, beginnings of agriculture was a gradual adjustment to control food availability
 - **Peruvian Coast**:
	 - Narrow desert shelf at the foot of the Andes, cut by small river valleys
	 - These valleys: Oases with rich soils, vegetation, good water
	 - Places where Peruvians began cultivating plants, building settlements and palaces
	 - Coast is really a series of micro-environments of water and land resources
	 - Warm El Nino countercurrent flows for about a year, occurs irregularly (every 6ish years) with major changes every 25 years, results in food migrating elsewhere reducing food resources
	 - During major El Ninos, catastrophic rains could destroy crops, could not store food for this unpredictability so had to keep population density low until the arrival of maize
 - **Early Settlement on the Peruvian Coast**:
	 - Coastal Equador, mountain slopes of Peru: Small scale foragers -> small scale farming by 8-7k BCE
	 - After 5000 BCE: More efficient collecction, fishing became more important
	 - As the Holocene continued, people moved right to coastal edge, started living in more lasting dwellings with the technology for deep-sea fishing
 - **Early Domesticates on the Peruvian Coast**:
	 - Evidence from Huaca Prieta and other sites: Coastal societies manipulating plants by 5k BCE
	 - Paloma site: Settled with simple huts, relied mostly on fish + gathering, also grew some things, kept llamas
	 - Chilca site: Ate sea resources, cultivated some plants, near a reedy marsh
	 - Emphasis on fish and cultivated squashes became standard sources of nutrition after 5.5k BCE
		 - Another key arrival: Maize found at Huaca Prieta 4825-4550 BCE

### The Arrival of Maize
 - Occurs during period of sustainable population growth for the first time
 - Settlements become more permanent, agriculture remained secondary to fishing
 - Maize farming changes Peruvian social organization:
	 - Required large irrigated fields to grow
	 - Labour required centralized organization for canal excavation and maintenance
	 - Crop yields expanded, majority of population moved inland, see social stratification emerge
 - More housing, large ceremonial pyramids, complexes of stone platforms in Chillon Valley
 - As temples emerge, so does loom-woven textiles and pottery. Form basis for later Peruvian civilization

### Archaic American SW
 - After 8k BCE, desert-adopted hunter-gatherers lived across arid southwest, beginning of Archaic period
 - 1000 years later, Cochise culture emerged
	 - Gathered plants, likely cultivated small scale plots
 - Earliest Mesoamerican crops to cross the Rio Grande: maize, beans, squash
 - DNA from maize sample: first entered the SW from Mexico through Sierra Madre mountains (2000 BCE)
	 - SW climate was more stable and wetter than today during this time
	 - Still unpredictable desert living, maize and beans were controlled and predictable
 - Further north (uplands) maize farming was also adopted due to increased population pressure
 - Hardy low-yield maize that first arrived in the SW: Chapalote form
	 - Genetically diverse but small
	 - Crossbred with wild teosinte to produce more varied + productive maize

### A New Maize
 - Chapalote maize could not be relied on entirely, lacks vital amino acids in beans and squash
	 - These three items need to be part of an agricultural diet
 - Different maize: Maiz de ocho, key to development in the SW
	 - Larger, more productive, easier to grind, flowered earlier (important for unpredictable rainfall)
 - After 500 BCE: Beans arrived, planted under maize to return nitrogen to soil when depleted by maize
	 - Late arrival of beans may explain why dependence on maize didn't occur sooner
 - Early farmers began to select for features to allow maize to grow in hostile places
	 - Gardens dispersed to minimize local floods or droughts
	 - Result: Huge variety of dry-climate agricultural techniques in the SW

### Path to Complexity in the SW
 - 300-500 CE, more tropical plants arrived, needed more irrigation so confined to warmest of the south
 - Point: Introduction of maize didn't trigger a dramatic cultural revolution
	 - Planted informally and sporadically, low yields compared to other foraged plants
 - Like Mesoamerica: Maize would become central in the SW
	 - Shift accompanied by growing sedentism and further investment in crops

### Preagriculture Eastern North America
 - Food resources in early Archaic east were more plentiful, many regional variations in material culture
	 - Lifeways broadly similar, every group could respond to changing local conditions more easily
 - Late Archaic: Population densities were high, groups increasingly restricted to small territories specialized in local resources
	 - Storage technologies emerged, as did extensive trade with neighbours
 - Result: 1700 BCE, more highly developed social complexity, status differentiation in burials
 - Inevitable these groups would eventually turn to deliberate food cultivation, they did so independently of other regions
	 - Between 2500 and 2000 BCE, goosefoot, marsh elder, gourd, sunflowers being planted and harvested

### Early Agriculture in Eastern North America
- Four initial plants collected from river floodplains for centuries before being cultivated
- Cultivation done somewhat accidentally
	- Sunflowers prized for oil, seeds drop easily into the riverside soils after being harvested
- These plants were very abundant in Mississippi Delta, none required the type of year-round shift in routine required by maize

### Mound Builders
 - 2000 BCE: mostly hunter-gatherers, increasing preoccupation with mortuary ritual, ancestors, new ideological foundation for eastern North Americans
	 - Cremation, exotic grave goods, building burial mounds
	 - Reasons: food exploitation, sedentism, regular social interaction, social ranking, ceremonialism
 - Excellent example of contrast with other contemporary hunter-gatherers:
	 - Poverty Point culture of lower Mississippi Valley and the Gulf Coast
	 - Settlement around 3k BCE, Poverty Point site (massive earthwork complex at confluence of six rivers) was built between 1700-1100 BCE, ceremonial and exchange hub
	 - Unsure of full-time inhabitants, massive communal effort required to build it (5 years labouring 70 days a year for 1000 people)
 - Earliest mound: Watson Brake (3500 BCE), predating the arrival of agriculture by 1000 years
	 - Best, clearest sign that agriculture was not a necessary step towards socio-political complexity
	 - Predates Stonehenge, Great Pyramids, required significant amount of social cohesion and communal labour
	 - Made with local materials, no signs of long distance trade

### Early Woodland Adena Period
 - Between 1000 BCE to 400 CE, Early Woodland people (Adena) flourished in Ohio Valley
	 - Seasonal camps relying on hunting, gathering, cultivating squash and starchy plants
	 - Continued to build burial mounds and impressive earthworks
 - Earthworks for ceremony, not defense. Followed contours of flat-topped hills and formed geometric shapes
	 - Mounds got larger over time as more people buried within (including less important cremations)

### Hopewell Tradition
 - 1000 years, Midwest saw advances in art and long-distance trade. Culminating in Hopewell Tradition
	 - Year 0
 - Culture based on small settlements with planting, hunting, gathering, distinctive stone tools
 - Famously applied much wealth and creativity on objects and rituals related to the afterlife
 - Art objects and prestige items traded in a huge network between local elites, used in ceremonies and burials
 - Hopewell mounds were more elaborate than Adena. 
	 - Mound City (Ohio) is enormous, 32 acres with 24 mounds
 - Seems that individual/multi-family households were concentrated around burial mounds
 - Foraged but cultivated plants in local gardens
 - Settlement system resembles Peer Polities: Small satellite settlements anchored to central ceremonial sites
	 - Central sites strategically located between territories (Hopewell, Newark)
	 - Self-sufficient during good years, insurance for bad years
 - Hopewell exchange system and interregional art style ended around 400 CE, Three theories:
	 - Horticulture beame so successful, incentives for long distance trade and gift giving disappeared
	 - Agriculture increased carrying capacity of landscape but was risky. Maize cultivation removed this risk, reducing importance of trade and personal prestige
	 - Population growth sparked competition for good arable land, resulting in increased ceremonialism and artwork. When all the good land was controlled, no communal ceremonies to bring people together (since they already were)
 - 800 CE: Maize cultivation spread throughout eastern North America from the Southwest
	 - Dietary advantages recognized in Mississippian cultures, helped facilitate complex society
