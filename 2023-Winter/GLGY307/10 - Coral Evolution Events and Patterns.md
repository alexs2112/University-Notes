### Phylum Cnidaria
 - Metazoans (multicellular organisms) organised in tissue-grade. No organs in their bodies
 - Characteristic feature of the representatives of this phylum is that they have nematocysts
	 - Cells that discharge a certain amount of poisonous substance capable of paralyzing or killing the prey

### Body Architecture
 - Polyp Stage:
	 - Sessile (fixed to sea bottom with a root-like structure)
	 - Asexual reproduction by budding
	 - Frequent in reef environments
 - Medusa Stage:
	 - Jellyfish-like (free-dweller in the oceanic water column)
	 - Sexual reproduction strategy

### Classification
 - **Hydrozoa**:
	 - Marine and fresh-water
	 - Hydroids or hydra exist, mostly in polyp stage
	 - Hydrozoans lack a mineralized skeleton and are rare in the fossil record
	 - Evolutionary occurrence is in the Carboniferous
 - **Scyphozoa**:
	 - Marine in habitat, mostly medusa
	 - Rare in the fossil record due to the lack of hard body parts (mostly water)
	 - Evolutionary occurrence is in the Cambrian
 - **Anthozoa**:
	 - Most of the fossil and living cnidarians (sea-pens, soft and stony corals)
	 - Evolved in the Cambrian, possibly late Proterozoic
	 - Exist only in the polyp stage, include 2300 genera and over 6000 species in fossil record

### Subclass Zoantaria
 - Stony corals, corallites
 - Includes three major orders: (many many others)
	 - Order Tabulata (Ordovician-Permian)
	 - Order Rugosa (Ordovician-Permian)
	 - Order Scleractinia (Triassic-Recent)
 - Between these orders -> Great Dying

### Order Tabulata (Tabulates)
 - Individuals (corallites) usually have no septa
 - Horizontal plates (tabulae) occur within corallite as the result of the growth process
 - Each hexagonal corallite groups together and grows to be very long
 - No corallite today has their interior separated by horizontal plates

### Order Rugosa (Tetracorals)
 - Both solitary and colonial
 - Name comes from wrinkled (rugose) aspect of individual corallites)
 - Tetracorals due to the general arrangement of the septae
 - Tabulae still exist in the tetracoral architecture, restricted to the lower portion of the corallite
	 - Can hardly be seen unless the specimen is sectioned
 - Mix both tabulae with longitudinal septae
![[order_rugosa.png|400]]
 - Cardinal septum: Does not have other attached septa to it (moving vertically)
 - Counter septum: Has a few lower order septae attached (moving at an angle from the cardinal)
 - Most of the lower order septae are attached to the alar and counter laterals
 - The resulting thickened calcareous structure in the central portion of the corallite is referred to as columella

### Order Scleractinia (Hexacorals)
 - Evolved after the Great Dying
 - No corals in the sedimentary rocks just above the Permian/Triassic boundary
 - All the corals of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic belong to this order
 - Also known as hexacorals due to the arrangement and addition of the septae
 - Clearly separated between hermatypic and ahermatypic scleractinians function of the symbiosis with the photosynthetic algae zooxanthelae
![[order_scleractinia.png|400]]
 - Septae are added successively and in sets at 60 degrees, six septae in a set
 - Oldest set of septae are known as protoseptae, others are metaseptae
