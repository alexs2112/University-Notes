	 - Five Kingdoms
	 - Age of oldest isolated life forms on earth, 3.5 billion years
 - Main Fossil Groups:
	 - Not super detailed, no classifications
	 - What's the group that includes the solitary representatives of lophophorades (???): Brachiopods
	 - Red Algae, Green Algae, Charophytes
	 - Two types of skeletons: Invertebrates, vertebrates
	 - Graptolites: Started as benthic organisms, eventually became plants

### **Midterm 2:** 30% (Mar 15th)
 - 35 Qs, 30% is free
 - Emergence of life and its evolution, most of the test, everything is of interest
	 - First two clues about the place and what life evolved
	 - Composition of oil, dominated by carbon and hydrogen, virtually unchanged over the whole phanerozoic
		 - Molecular composition of living matter, dominated by water, life evolved in aquatic environment
		 - Inorganic simple monomers and organic monomers (simple substances, amino acids), polymers (repeated chains of organic monomers via polymerization)
			 - Know the three chains of polymerization, proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, the names of each part of the polymer chain
	 - Formation of the early crust, earth primordial atmosphere, formation of the early oceans (4.4 billion years), catastrophic meteorite bombardment (plate tectonics on Earth, noticable on mercury, mars, moon)
 - Succession of records
	 - Isua Supercrustal Group (southwestern greenland, **3.7-3.8 billion years old**)
	 - Apex Chert, first isolated bacteria and cyanobacteria, Apex Chert Cyanobacteria dominates, **age 3.5 billion years** (approximates best the age of oldest isolated cells we know)
	 - Stromatolites, bacteria and cyanobacteria
		 - Composition of the stromatolite, most organisms in growth surface, undermat contains some organisms, oxygen-depleted zone is dominated by extremophiles (??, anaerobic), most mass is dead rock (calcium carbonate)
		 - Stromatolite distribution patterns through time
	 - Schreiber Beach in Ontario, fossils within stromatolitic structures, 2.1 billion years, paleoproterozoic, discovery documents the prokaryote diversification
		 - Molecular oxygen factories of stromatolites changed the Earth atmosphere, practically responsible for the evolution of eukaryotes
	 - Eukaryotes identified for the first time in the Bitter Springs formation in Australia
	 - Banded Iron Formations, change in Earth atmosphere, archean-proterozoic boundary
 - After Eukaryotes, massive diversification of life forms on Earth
	 - First multicellular organism: Bangiomorpha, red algae
	 - Storidonaphiicus?: Green algae, 
	 - Chewaria?: Green algae (large size, 1-2 cm, plantic algae)
	 - Torridonophycus: Testate amoeba, animal metabolism
	 - Melanocyrrilium
 - Multicellular Organisms
	 - Snowball Earth, succession of glacial pulses that endangered life completely
	 - Evolution of animal multicellularity, documented by Otavia? (south african amoeba, calcereous sponge)
	 - Animal embryos, Toishdan? formation in China
 - Ediacarans:
	 - Occur as impressions, lack hard body parts (dont mineralized)
	 - ??: First organism in history with trilateral symmetry
	 - ??: Large sized organism resembling a flat worm, well-developed bilateral symmetry, well-developed body segmentation
	 - Spriggina: Beginning of the process of cephalization (cephalic shield)
	 - Kimberella: Earliest mollusk in history
	 - Newer discoveries: Organisms with well defined body cavity
		 - Bonata, Oniga, Wendia
	 - Newest part of proterozoic: Evolution of skeletons, mineralized parts
		 - First record of sponges as isolated spicus (?)
		 - Evolution of gnidarians
			 - Cloudina
			 - Sinotubulitus?: Meaning - Tubelike organism from China
 - Uppermost part of neoproterozoic:
	 - Earliest very shallow trace fossils of organism movement, indicate some organisms started to dig
 - After precambrian-cambrian boundary
	 - Fossil based on this limit: tricophyduspicum?, boundary between proterozoic-cambrian
	 - Diversification of trace fossils, lusuphycus?, worldwide trace fossil, identify the lower cambrian
 - Stratigraphical order: Evolution of earliest shelly fauna, Tommotian stage of the lower cambrian, Tommotian fauna
	 - Lautushella?: probably ancient gastropod
	 - Eukelsmella???: Siphon, demonstrates its a mollusk
 - Archaeocyaphids?: First reef builders in our planet, calcereous sponges
	 - Two walls, concentrical distribution, outer and inner walls, inner wall defines internal cavity, space between walls is known as intervalum
	 - Attached to seafloor by rootlike structure
	 - Abundant in the upper part of the lower cambrian, rare in middle cambrian, only one occurrance in upper cambrian
 - Cambrian Explosion: Evolution of trilobites
	 - Burgess Shale: Explosion of evolution of life on earth
		 - In British Columbia
		 - Age: Middle Cambrian
		 - Some organisms:
			 - Anomalocaris: First global predator on Earth, T-Rex of the Cambrian
			 - Opabinia: 5 eyes, mouth produced at the end of a probiscis structure
			 - Ayisheaia: Mixed features between segmented worms and arthropods, resembles modern onychophorids
		 - Cheungjiang fauna
 - Evolution of Corals:
	 - Tabulata, Rugosa: Ordovician - Permian, extinct at great dying
	 - Scleratinia: Mesozoic - ?
	 - Morphology is important
	 - Tabulata: Interior is subdivided by horizontal plates (tabulae), entirely colonial (not solitary)
	 - Rugosa: Colonial and solitary, tetracorals
	 - Scleratinia: Colonial and solitary, hexacorals
	 - Interior arrangement of longitudinal partitions, know their names and types
