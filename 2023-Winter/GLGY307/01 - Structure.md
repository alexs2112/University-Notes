	 - Open book, no digital notes
	 - Superficial questions, no detail or interpretations
	 - Fossil vs subfossil
	 - Fossil classifications: Body fossils (include imprints), trace fossils, chemical fossils
		 - Hard body parts vs soft body parts
	 - History of fossil classification: first name to report in a scientific way fossils from southern italy, western croatia, Xenophanes of Colophon
		 - Oldest discovered in ancient Egypt
	 - Paleontology subdisciplines
	 - Igneous (no fossils), Sedimentary, Metamorphic rocks
		 - Clastic rocks
		 - Weathering, erosion, transport, lithification (sediment -> sedimentary rock)
		 - 3 types of metamorphism: Regional, Thermal, Burial
		 - Most in sedimentary, occasionally in metamorphic, none in igneous
	 - Process of fossilization: 
		 - Most important condition is to be buried rapidly
		 - Major source of questions
	 - Tophonomy, role in interpreting fossil record:
		 - Won't be any questions
	 - Exceptional fossil preservation:
		 - Fossil Lagerstatten, preservation of soft body parts and colour pattern
	 - Geological Time:
		 - Each topic can have a couple questions
		 - Steno Principles, Sir William Smith
		 - Subdivisions of the geological time scale
			 - Four Eons
			 - Youngest period of paleozoic era: Permian
			 - Oldest at the bottom, youngest at the top
			 - Boundaries between eons and periods of the phanerozoic
	 - Classification:
		 - Questions will be about the hierarchies
			 - What taxonomic level is between subclass and superorder: Infraclass
		 - Five Kingdoms
		 - Age of oldest isolated life forms on earth, 3.5 billion years
	 - Main Fossil Groups:
		 - Not super detailed, no classifications
		 - What's the group that includes the solitary representatives of lophophorades (???): Brachiopods
		 - Red Algae, Green Algae, Charophytes
		 - Two types of skeletons: Invertebrates, vertebrates
