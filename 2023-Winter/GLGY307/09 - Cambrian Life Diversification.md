### Earliest Shelly Animals
 - Discovered in the Latest neoproterozoic of Namibia (SW Africa)
 - Called Cloudina
 - Calcitic, tubelike fossil
 - Each discovery was completely recrystallized, could not determine the structure
 - Looks like a worm, but worms are extremely evolved, did not exist before the Precambrian
 - Cloudina precipitated calcium carbonate just like cnidirians, determined to be a coral
	 - Always has the same morphology no matter where it is found, not a coral
 - Cloudina-like fossils found in China, determined it is a sponge, extinct for a long time but reappeared here

### Precambrian/Cambrian Boundary
 - Thought for long periods of time that this boundary can be defined according to presence/absence of animals with an exoskeleton
 - Abandoned due to huge data accumulation on fossils in the proximity of this boundary
 - Found organisms that began to dig in the sediment, creatures began moving deeper and deeper over time
	 - Found new sources of food, decomposing organic matter
	 - New group of organisms, new ecological niches, evolution took over
 - Index Fossil: Trichophycuspedom (formerly Phycodespedum)
	 - New stage of Earth: Plenty of nutrients, organisms are far more advanced
 - Russophycus: Frequent above the boundary, bilaterally symmetrical trace fossils

### First Abundant Shelly Faunas
 - Earliest true faunas consisting of several genera and species that present well-developed shells are known from the Early Cambrian (Tommotian Stage)
 - Small-sized, some being calcareous, some phosphatic in nature
	 - 5 mm in size, giant at the time
	 - Extremely diverse composition

### Tommotian Fauna Generalities
 - Latouchella: strange, gently coiled shell made of one piece, gastropod-like
 - Yochelcinoella: Like a latouchella but with a siphon on the shell, is a mollusk
 - These are the first snails/brachiopods
	 - They love eating stromatolites, first predators
 - Shells are tubular, spinose, conical, plates or sclerites also occur
