### Earliest Shelly Animals
 - Discovered in the Latest neoproterozoic of Namibia (SW Africa)
 - Called Cloudina
 - Calcitic, tubelike fossil
 - Each discovery was completely recrystallized, could not determine the structure
 - Looks like a worm, but worms are extremely evolved, did not exist before the Precambrian
 - Cloudina precipitated calcium carbonate just like cnidirians, determined to be a coral
	 - Always has the same morphology no matter where it is found, not a coral
 - Cloudina-like fossils found in China, determined it is a sponge, extinct for a long time but reappeared here

### Precambrian/Cambrian Boundary
 - Thought for long periods of time that this boundary can be defined according to presence/absence of animals with an exoskeleton
 - Abandoned due to huge data accumulation on fossils in the proximity of this boundary
 - Found organisms that began to dig in the sediment, creatures began moving deeper and deeper over time
	 - Found new sources of food, decomposing organic matter
	 - New group of organisms, new ecological niches, evolution took over
 - Index Fossil: Trichophycuspedom (formerly Phycodespedum)
	 - New stage of Earth: Plenty of nutrients, organisms are far more advanced
 - Russophycus: Frequent above the boundary, bilaterally symmetrical trace fossils

### First Abundant Shelly Faunas
 - Earliest true faunas consisting of several genera and species that present well-developed shells are known from the Early Cambrian (Tommotian Stage)
 - Small-sized, some being calcareous, some phosphatic in nature
	 - 5 mm in size, giant at the time
	 - Extremely diverse composition

### Tommotian Fauna Generalities
 - Latouchella: strange, gently coiled shell made of one piece, gastropod-like
 - Yochelcinoella: Like a latouchella but with a siphon on the shell, is a mollusk
 - These are the first snails/brachiopods
	 - They love eating stromatolites, first predators
 - Shells are tubular, spinose, conical, plates or sclerites also occur
 - Microcystis: Flanked with sclerites and legs beneath. Scales & Sclerites with hornes are good for defense against carnivorous worms, inefficient against predators that swallow them as a whole
 - Evolution and development of the Tommotian fauna had a major impact on the preexisting life forms on earth
	 - Tommotian fauna diversification is associated with a strong reduction in the stromatolite occurrences

### NA - Main Tectonic Structures
 - Canadian Shield: Strongest stretch in North America
 - North American Platform: Represented by shallow waters (200m), stable, coagulated around the Canadian Shield
	 - Surrounded by shallow depression basins
 - Mobile Belts: Permanent source of earthquakes, extremely unstable. Four in NA

### Earth's Climate
 - Seven-fold oscillation history in the Late Precambrian-Phanerozoic stratigraphic interval
 - Greenhouse: Warm and Humid
 - Icehouse: Dry, Cold, Arid
 - [fix colours of graph]

### Sea Level Fluctuations
 - Sea level was not constant
 - Major transgression initiated in the late Proterozoic folloing the major Marinoan Glaciation
 - Transgression from Precambrian to Ordovician: Sauk Transgression, increase in sea level
 - Evolution needed to be fast

### Intertidal Sedimentation
 - Stromatolites were widespread in the carbonate facies on both sides of the craton
 - Insane tides and currents, every 24 hours would rise and recede across most of North America

### Archaeocyathids - First Reef Builders
 - Calcareous sponges
 - Cup-like structure, small size, two-walls (outer and inner walls) defining a central cavity
	 - Walls contain an intervalve (intervalum), and are full of septum (calcitic walls connecting the inner and outer walls), attached to the seafall with rootlike structures
	 - Calcitic, not flexible
	 - Totally covered in pores (minus roots)
 - Wherever they grew they had resistance to the currents
 - Lived in new reefs, water energy is higher, carries small-sized particles through the pores of the organisms that they would eat and develop
 - Very small reefs (maximum 2m in diameter, max 50 cm in height)

### Trilobites
 - Cambrian explosion: Massive life diversification
	 - Representative of the trilobites
 - Body can be divided into three obvious parts
 - Very successful from the beginning
	 - Evolved new defensive strategy
	 - Large sized populations (cockroaches of paleozoic), always enough to ensure species survival
	 - Two very well-developed eyes to spot predators from a long distance
	 - First molting species, inflexible carapace
 - Extraordinarily diverse through Cambrian and Ordovician
	 - Cambropallus: very large variant, 1 foot in length, predators don't want to attack a big guy
		 - Most trilobites are still very small, few cm
 - Eventually died out when the predators were too large and diverse, Trilobites are primitive
 - At first: benthic, moving at the bottom of the oceans/sea
 - Eventually evolved planktic form of life, small size, limited opportunities of movement
	 - Head and the tale are almost equal to rotate their body in any direction (water currents)
	 - Thorax reduced to 2-3 segments
	 - These trilobites are blind, turbulent waters, couldn't see far away anyways

### Burgess Shale
 - Middle cambrian age
 - Burgess Shale fossils were discovered by Walcott at the very beginning of the XXth (??) century in BC
 - Very important fossiliferous points
 - Fossils were buried along the continental slope at the slope base
 - Mobile belts surrounding NA, frequent earthquakes, lots of unconsolidated sediments
	 - Large underwater landslides, deposited huge communities down the slope
	 - Buried alive, extremely rapid burial in very fine sediments (high resolution)
	 - Fossils mostly found in dark covered layers, anoxic conditions so no scavengers
 - Chordate - Pikaia: Cephalocordate, similar to modern lancelet, small antennae on head, tapering tail for swimming
	 - Full of V-shaped muscles
 - Opabinia: Five eyes protruding from head, elongated, irregular hole in the head for extended mouth (probiscus with mouth on the end), predator to eat burrowers
 - Anomalocaris: Most important predator, up to one meter in length, body covered with thick and elongated tissues/chitins, had large eyes to spot prey, extremely efficient predator, global range and the first major predator of the cambrian times
	 - So efficient at hunting they ate everything, had to resort to cannibalism
 - Wiwaxia: 3-5 cm in length, headless body covered by protective armor plates, long spines
 - Hallucigenia: Long wormlike organism with appendages on both the top and bottom of the creature. Rounded head. At first thought it lived in turbulent waters, needed legs on its back to flip it back upright. Then realized they were just spines
 - Ayisheaia: Missing link to Onychophorids (segmented worms without other fossil records)
