### First Major Crisis
##### Early Earth Events
 - Early crust formation: Temperature difference between hot Earth and cold space, heat remained trapped at the Earth interior
 - Early atmosphere formation: Result of mixture of gasses from the Solar System formation and the new ones from the volcanic phenomena in the Earth
 - Ocean formation: Accumulation of water from vapour condensation
 - Catastrophic meteorite bombardment: Infer data from Moon, Mercury, Mars. Our plate tectonics remove visible meteorite impacts from Earth. **First Major Crisis on Earth**
	 - Too explosive

### Second Major Crisis
 - Represented by Banded Iron Formation
 - Molecular oxygen existed in abundance
 - Transformation of an anaerobic atmosphere to an aerobic atmosphere, toxic to the preexisting organisms
	 - Too toxic
 - Evolution of sexual reproduction (Eukaryotes)

### Third Major Crisis
 - Snowball Earth
 - Life almost became extinct, very rare to find them from this time
	 - Too cold
 - Evolution of animal multicellularity

### Fourth Major Crisis
 - Great dying, collapse of ocean conveyor
 - Evaporation at very high levels, volcanic events lead to increase of Earth's temperature (carbon dioxide), surface became very hot
 - Nearly everything went extinct
 - Evolution of conscience (mammals) <- reaches outside science, "conscience", good or bad
