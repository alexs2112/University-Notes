### Hierarchical Classification
 - Linean Classification based on Aristotelian philosophy
 - Organisms grouped together based on morphological similarities
 - Fundamental unit is that of species
 - Binomial nomenclature system
 - Trinomial system (subspecies included)
 - Don't memorize full modern hierarchy, just recognize the patterns and general hierarchy

# Kingdoms of Life
### Kingdom Bacteria
 - Simplest forms of life in the fossil record
 - Bacteria, Cyanobacteria
	 - Oldest fossils on Earth
 - Can occur as isolated fossils, or can be grouped together into large clusters of Stromatolites, dominated most of Earth's history through stromatolites
 - Most diverse array of metabolic strategies

### Kingdom Protista
 - Mostly single celled organisms, rarely colonial, rarely multicellular eukaryotic organisms
 - Eukaryotes have well-defined nucleus/nuclei in the cytoplasm mass
 - Many eukaryote groups develop external protective structures, or internal skeleton to support various cytoplasm components
	 - Some of the best fossil records
 - Sexual reproduction, high rate of evolution

### Kingdom Fungi
 - Rarely occur in the fossil record, many species are undiscovered/unstudied
 - Extremely diverse among modern life forms
 - Most frequent occurrence is fossilized plant roots (rhizoliths)
 - Not very important for this course

### Kingdom Plantae
 - Dominated by photosynthetic organisms, higher algae and plants are in this kingdom
 - Land plants evolved after the land colonization, over 400 mya
 - Woody tissue is a frequent development among continental plants, especially in those with large-sized bodies
	 - Well-known in fossil record
 - Evolved rapidly once roots were created, less than 1mya to evolve leaves, exponential evolution after that
	 - Wide scale ecological adaptation

### Kingdom Animalia
 - Most evolved organisms on Earth, extremely diverse (probably most diverse)
	 - Very high rate of evolution
	 - Intelligence, flight, skeletons, vertebrates
 - Adapted to a variety of environments
 - Homogenous metabolic strategy in aerobic heterotrophy (aerobic respiration)
 - Most have well-developed movement capabilities
 - Most evolved animals develop a vertebral column
