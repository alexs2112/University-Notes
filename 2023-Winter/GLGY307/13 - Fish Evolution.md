Evolved from Agnathans with the evolution of jaws

### Acanthodi
 - Earliest Gnathostomes (animals with mouths with jaws)
 - Spiny, fins are used for body balance and present a bony spine
	 - Extremely efficient moving in one way
	 - Extremely sluggish to turn
	 - Good for defending against predators
 - Diplacanthus: Middle Devonian, reach length of up to 4 meters (sometimes 5), spines up to 60 cm
	 - Relatively reduced evolutionary importance
	 - Many, practically found everywhere from Silurian to Devonian

### Placoderms
 - Remarkable active dwellers, either in oceanic water mass or in the proximity of the sea floor
 - Hid their lower body behind bony plates, very strong
 - Two groups:
	 - Arthrodires: Formidable predators of large dimensions, up to 10 meters in length
	 - Biggest predators of the Devonian
	 - Antiarchs: Mud-grubbers like their ostracoderm ancestors

### Arthrodires
 - Dunkleosteus: Classical example
	 - Cephalic shield consists of several bony plates, connected in certain points (and only those points), extremely flexible and fast
	 - Top predator of the Devonian

### Antiarchs
 - Coccosteus: Classical example
	 - Well ornamented plates in the cephalic shield, fins also protected by plates, the rest of the body is not protected
	 - Found some structures inside them resembling lungs, although they lived in shallow waters they could have moved inland for food or reproduction
 - Rachiosteus, other example

### Devonian Fishes
 - Devonian fish fossil record show ancestors of both important fish groups of today
	 - Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous skeleton, sharks)
	 - Osteichthyes (bony fishes, most of the fishes today)
		 - Only prey, needed to survive somehow
			 - Large numbers
			 - Needed to be faster, suck water from surrounding environment and send to the gills, more oxygen to the lungs
		 - None of the above helped, the vertebrates evolved differently to survive:
			 - They got out of the water, conquest of land (Osteichthyes), very high adaptability
			 - Conquest of land attempted many times, only succeeded in the Late Devonian

### Ancient Sharks - Devonian
 - Most frequent sharks: Cladoselache
	 - Small, no longer than 1 meter
	 - Solitary predator, no match for Dunkleosteus
 - Stethacanthus
	 - Discovered in Russia
	 - Numerous skeletons found in a very narrow region of the seabed
	 - Only conclusion: Submarine landslide covering a huge group of them at once
		 - Group hunter
 - Sharks didn't become top predators until the cenozoic times

### Batoid Sharks
 - Squatina: Upper Jurassic
	 - Each piece of the skeleton consisted of cartilage, small chances to fossilize
	 - Adapted to life in proximity of the sea bottom

### Fresh-Water Shark
 - Lebacanthus:
	 - Adapted to evade its predators and enemies in the salty waters by hiding in the fresh waters
		 - Still had Placoderms, slightly smaller and fewer

### Osteichthyes, Order Dipnoi
 - Dipnoi: Lungfishes
 - Most of the lungfish live in freshwater rivers that periodically dry out
 - The fish then burrow into the mud and aestivate, breathing through their lungs
	 - Hibernate during environmental stress
 - Their heat is partly divided into a left and a right half, as in true land vertebrates
	 - This suggests that the lungfishes and land vertebrates have undergone the same ecological pressures.
 - Short extensions of muscle at the base of their fins, a step towards the evolution of limbs
 - Fossil dipnoi: 
	 - Largest lungfish today is 1.5 meters (Australia)
	 - In the past they were gigantic, achieved gigantism

### Order Actinisca
 - Made history towards amphibians
 - Evolved rapidly in the Devonian
 - Some of the best specimens come from Lebanon
 - Long fins, extension of the muscle tissue down the base of the fins, lobed-fin fishes
 - Extremely diverse, not important predators until the Cretaceous times (rather small, perfect prey)
	 - As perfect prey, needed to adapt to new conditions

### Order Rhipidista
 - First occurred in the Lower Devonian, diversified in the Middle Devonian
 - Eusthenopteron:
	 - Middle-Late Devonian
	 - More muscle extensions down the base of the fins
	 - Transition from fishes to amphibians, this is the last fish, all the others will eventually evolve to amphibians.
