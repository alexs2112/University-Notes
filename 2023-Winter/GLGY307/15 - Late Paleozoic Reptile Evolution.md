### Kinds of Amniotes
 - Classification according to the number of holes in the skull behind the eye socket
	 - Anapsid (no holes)
	 - Diapsid (two holes)
	 - Synapsid (one hole, more evolved than Diapsids)
 - These openings are used for different muscles, determining the biting capabilities of certain reptiles
 - (ES: Eye Socket)

### Early Reptiles - Diapsides
 - Early amniotes adopted a fully terrestrial life mode, not because of reproduction, but because of the availability of food (insects, worms, etc)
	 - Reproduced by a small number of eggs, protected by a shell
	 - Some began nurturing their eggs until they hatched (did not nurture offsprings)
 - Major evolution in the reptile group: Chest bone -> capable of active breathing through the nostrils
 - Moved at very high speeds, small lizards with extremely high diversity and adaptability
 - Petrolacosaurus - forest wanderer, late Early Carboniferous
 - Hylonomus - early amniote from Late Carboniferous
 - Two small reptiles: Mesosaurus (on all continents but with short swimming distance), Stereosternum

### Earlier Reptiles
 - Amniotes developed full adaptation to the terrestrial conditions
 - One of the major challenges was the greater temperature differences
 - As a result, developed various mechanisms of thermoregulation
	 - More efficient at gathering solar heat, started to increase in size

### Synapsids
 - Dominated the Late Paleozoic (Late Carboniferous-Permian) land faunas
 - Diapsids include the dominant groups of the Mesozoic (dinosaurs, pterosaurs)
 - Turtles have no skull openings, technically anapsid. Most likely re-adapted to the aquatic conditions as their ancestors were diapsids, losing skull openings during evolution
 - Earlier synapsids are known as pelycosaurids
	 - Developed backsails, extensions on the back vertebrate connected through vascularized skin. Essentially a huge solar panel sticking straight out of its back
	 - First attempt of partly regulating their body temperature, began to increase in size (up to 4m length)

### Pelycosaurids
 - Extremely diverse from the beginning, shortly after their evolution they became more diverse than earliest diapsids
 - Totally dominated the Late Mississippian and Pennsylvanian times
 - Group of fully terrestrial tetrapods
 - Form 50% of the Late Carboniferous amniotes, 70% of the Early Carboniferous ones
 - Decline in Late Permian as some evolved into the dominant therapsid group
 - Forelimbs were massive, role likely to prevent the animal from falling on its face
 - Thrust given by strong back legs, no well-defined ankle joint, strong muscles to rotate femur in the hip joint
 - Evolution of backsails occurred simultaneously between two groups that look very similar:
	 - Edaphosaurus (vegetarian, lived in large crowds) and Dimetrodon (predator, individual)

### Behavioural Thermoregulation
 - Lived in equatorial, tropical regions, but were active over a long period of time (even overnight)
 - Pelycosaurs developed new system of behavioural thermoregulation
 - Body of the pelycosaurs could function over a range of the internal temperature
 - An optimum is within that range and pelycosaurs tried to control it at that level
 - Large-sized reptiles were confined to the tropical and subtropical zones
 - Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus independently developed large "sails", probably rotated to capture the sunshine, used to assure rapid and sensitive control over the body temperature
 - Pangaea begins to form during the Carboniferous, the south pole ice cap also expands, too cold for pelycosaurs
	 - Pangaea finishes during Permian, slightly warmer with extremely harsh winters
	 - Pelycosaurs tried to migrate to the south (Gondwana), way too cold for them

### Invasion of Gondwana
 - Invention of backsails was not enough, their skin could not retain heat
 - Restricted to the warmer tropical and subtropical regions
 - Formation of Pangaea resulted in the appearance of a zone with potential to be invaded
 - Invasion of Gondwana (in Pangaea) happened with adaptation to the colder environments

### Mammal-like Reptiles
 - Therapsid stock developed at mid and high latitudes
 - Their bodies appear adapted to retain the heat (massive bodies, thick limbs)
	 - Limbs positioned at the bottom of their bodies, not the sides (like reptiles)
 - Evolved a layer of fat tissue, capable to retain heat
 - Too big and too cold climate, could not be powered by the solar heat
 - Porous bones, resembling mammals, red cells of the blood produced in the bones, warm blooded organisms
 - Probably developed furry skin and mammal-like thermoregulation, automatic internal control
	 - Bodies adapted for conserving the heat, not for generating it, still a long way to evolve to mammal stage
 - Even discovered them up north in Siberia (instead of southern Gondwana)
	 - Teeth capable of performing different functions (elongated canine fangs)
	 - Ivantosaurus: two extremely elongated teeth, major predator, extremely large, capable of killing in one bite
