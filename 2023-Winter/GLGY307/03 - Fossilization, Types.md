### Process of Fossilization
 - Transformation of dead organisms into fossils
 - **Casual Fossilization Process**: frequent, lower quality (permineralization, carbonization, recrystallization), soft tissue preservation is very rare
 - **Exceptional Fossilization Processes**: soft tissues are preserved constantly (congealment, amber+tar, etc)

### Permineralization
 - Occurs in fossils with a porous internal structure
	 - Tree trunk (Psaronius, filled with little air pockets)
	 - Bones (creature dies, tissues decompose, fluids enter the buried bones
 - Fluids enter the pores and empty spaces, reach critical concentration and begin to precipitate new minerals to fill the pores
	 - Petrification is both Permineralization and the preservation of the rest of the body (Lithification)
 - Usually fractional, multiple stages of fluids to form smaller and smaller rings of different minerals as the previous rings harden

### Recrystallization
 - Mineral structure changes (aragonite to calcite, both are types of calcium carbonate)
	 - Calcium carbonate composes limestone
	 - Frequently dissolved calcium carbonate in oceans and seas
	 - Calcium carbonate is extremely toxic for organisms, begin to form shells and stuff by precipitating calcium carbonate to protect themselves from it (and other predators)
		 - Precipitated calcium carbonate usually in the form of aragonite, not a stable mineral.
		 - As long as the organism is alive, metabolic keeps the aragonite structure intact and stable. When they die, the aragonite begins to recrystallize to the more stable calcite

### Moldic Preservation and Replacement
 - Dead organism at the bottom of a sedimentary basin
 - Scavengers destroy the soft tissue
 - Burial begins, enclosing the shell of the organism
 - Lithification happens, then loose sediment is turned into a rigid sedimentary rock
 - Fluids circulate, original aragonite is turned into calcite, highly reactive, dissolves and leaves nothing behind of the organism
 - Rock that preserves the original shape of the dead organism
	 - Cast is the external part
	 - Mold is the internal part
 - Replacement: Fluids continue to circulate, if they reach the critical mass then new minerals are formed, can be totally inorganic (pyrite)

### Carbonization
 - Most frequent in plants and invertebrate animals
 - After the organism death, bacterial decomposition and subterranean fluid activity will react with the CHON elements, in time N, O, S, P will be expelled, leaving only Carbon and Hydrogen
 - Carbon and Hydrogen eventually generate oil and natural gas, at high temperature all of the Hydrogen is expelled
 - Carbon crystallizes as graphite, extremely stable

### Impregnation
 - Sedimentary basins (tropical seas), concentration of calcium carbonate is so high that it begins to precipitate from the sea water.
 - Algaes and similar soft-tissued organisms get covered by calcium carbonate, while they are alive they prevent the mineral from entering their body
	 - This process for hard tissues is lithification (don't need to know)
 - After death, the soft tissues are preserved by the calcium carbonate, that impregnates and precipitates the dead tissue

### Congealment
 - Frozen swamps in high altitudes in permafrost conditions
 - Organisms can be trapped in the frozen swamps, where they drown and are completely preserved

### Dehydration, Dessication
 - Dry, arid regions
 - After death of an organism, they lose body fluids quickly and mummify
 - High temperatures preserve the body and the organs

### Fossilization in Amber and Tar Pits
 - Amber:
	 - Most sophisticated and best preservation
	 - Nearly impossible to extract from amber
	 - Sticky natural resin, the organism gets stuck inside and coated in more amber that hardens
 - Tar Pits:
	 - Example: La Brea tar pits
	 - Oil comes to the surface, creates a toxic swamp with toxic gases (methane, ethane)
	 - Organisms that get too close to the toxic swamp will suffocate, if they fall in the swamp they will be perfectly preserved
	 - Perfectly fossilized internal organs

### Exceptional Preservation (Fossil Lagerstatten <- Not Tested On Name)
 - Organisms can be very well preserved through casual fossilization processes
	 - Skeletal parts remain in anatomical connection
	 - Colour patterns are preserved
	 - Non-mineralized parts of the organisms are preserved

### Hunsruck Shale - Germany
 - Pyritization of marine fossils preserving them
	 - No anoxic sedimentary layer needed

### Colour Patterns - Ukraine
 - Colour patterns were not preserved
 - Pigments are unstable, decompose quickly due to substances in the surrounding environment
	 - Brachiopods have colours that are not present in mollusks
	 - Preserves the pattern, not the pigments themselves
