### The Coelacanth: Latimeria
 - Offshore Africa, discovered by local fishermen
 - Serious predator, survived to modern time with some modifications
 - Large guy

### Ichthyostega & Acanthostega
 - First amphibians, discovered in Greenland
 - Belonged to two genera
 - Still present fish characteristics: delicate vertebrae and costae, internal gills strongly reduced but still functional
 - The  back limbs have more than five toes (six or seven)
	 - Lacking fins, toes instead
 - The bodies are compressed at the back
 - Skulls present two large eye sockets, situated on top. Semi aquatic mode of life

### Fish-Amphibian Transition
 - Transition between aquatic and terrestrial way of life is not difficult to demonstrate
 - Inferred life positions give us a hint about resemblances between rhipidistians and the earliest amphibians
 - Most obvious general aspect is the limbs
 - Respiration was both lungs and skin, needed their skin to be kept wet
 - Lay a huge number of unprotected eggs (like fish)

### Major Changes in Fin-Limb Structure
![[fin-limb_structure.png|300]]
 - Evolve to more advanced morphological types

### Earliest Tetrapods
 - Acanthostega and Ichthyostega spent their life in water
	 - Fundamentally they were aquatic animals
 - Described often as having an amphibious way of life
 - Acanthostega had very thin and many limbs, did not make a ton of use of accumulating oxygen through their lungs
	 - Evolution of chest bone is what makes us different than amphibians, to breathe oxygen
 - Ichthyostega: Spine is better developed, larger ribs, limbs are far more robust to thrust body inland
	 - Wide and large ribs to protect the internal parts of the body (heart and lungs) from attack
	 - Attackers would be other Ichthyostega, assume they were cannibals from the beginning

### Stem Tetrapods
 - Several tetrapod lineages in the Devonian and Carboniferous
 - Acanthostega was more iamphibious in habitat than Ichthyostega, which apeared to have spent more time on land. However they had more than five toes, a feater that made them closer to crossopterygians
 - Pederpes is the first stem tetrapod with five toes, discovered in the Early Carboniferous of Scotland
	 - Important, first organism to have limbs with exactly five toes
 - As they moved inland, they began to reduce their size due to their poorly developed muscles
 - Earliest tetrapods represent group with high evolution potential, leaving two important descendant groups: Amphibia (Amphibians) and Amniota (birds, reptiles, mammals)
	 - Distinct groups, ancestors in the early tetrapod group
	 - Began laying eggs coated by a protective mineralized structure (shell)
	 - These tetrapods are neither the ancestors of Amphibia or Amniota are the stem tetrapods
 - **Diversification**: 
	 - Lower Carboniferous of Scotland: Immediately after Devonian times, Tetrapods found at different levels than fishes, demonstrating a complete separation of habitats
	 - Amphibians only found in terrestrial deposits, serious inland migration, capable of developing most of their life cycle inland and returned only for reproduction
	 - Two new groups:
		 - Anthracosaurians
		 - Temnospondyls

### Temnospondyls
 - Considered the ancestors of the modern amphibians (Lisamphibia)
 - Most diverse group in the Carboniferous, consisting of approx 40 families and 160 genera
	 - Eryops: Capable of land locomotion, spent most time in the water. Size of a crocodile, similar in habitat. Rather large with muscle, already started to gain a lot of weight. Evolved quite fast
		 - Top predator of the lower Carboniferous in continental conditions
	 - Cacops: Completely adapted to terrestrial habitat (Permian), approximately 40cm long
		 - Looks like a large frog, gave birth to the modern Amphibians
		 - Lisamphibians: Frogs, Salamanders, Newts

### Modern Amphibians
 - All small-bodied and soft-skinned, strongly differing from earliest tetrapods
	 - Very poor fossil record
 - Living amphibians are newts, salamanders, frogs, etc, in the group Lisamphibia (smooth ambphibians)
 - Lisamphibians first occurred in the Late Permian

### Anthracosaurians
 - Ancestors of the amniotes (evolved vertebrates, ultimately lead to evolution of reptiles)
	 - Crocodile-like fisheaters
	 - Jaws designed for slamming shut on prey
	 - Up to 4 meters in length, some with slender bodies, fully adapted for terrestrial life
 - Major predators, upper part of Mississipian: Replaced Eryops as top predators inland
 - Limitations: Double respiration, permanently stuck to aquatic life
	 - No active way of breathing, had lungs but they did not breathe, had to swallow the oxygen, skin had to remain wet all the time

### Seymouria
 - Permian of Germany, fully adapted to the terrestrial life
 - Morphological features of a reptile, but does not have a chest bone (could not breathe actively)
	 - [Or is this backwards? Features of amphibian but with a chest bone]
 - Size of these guys are approximately 60 centimeters in length

### Amniotes
 - Most advanced organisms, needed to evolve to not require wet skin
 - Egg is inside a membrane, small number of eggs protected by a shell
 - Amniotes includes the higher evolved vertebrates: Reptiles, Birds, Mammals
 - New chapter of history of life: One group capable of spending its entire life inland
