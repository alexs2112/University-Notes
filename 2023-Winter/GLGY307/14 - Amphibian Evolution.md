### The Coelacanth: Latimeria
 - Offshore Africa, discovered by local fishermen
 - Serious predator, survived to modern time with some modifications
 - Large guy

### Ichthyostega & Acanthostega
 - First amphibians, discovered in Greenland
 - Belonged to two genera
 - Still present fish characteristics: delicate vertebrae and costae, internal gills strongly reduced but still functional
 - The  back limbs have more than five toes (six or seven)
	 - Lacking fins, toes instead
 - The bodies are compressed at the back
 - Skulls present two large eye sockets, situated on top. Semi aquatic mode of life

### Fish-Amphibian Transition
 - Transition between aquatic and terrestrial way of life is not difficult to demonstrate
 - Inferred life positions give us a hint about resemblances between rhipidistians and the earliest amphibians
 - Most obvious general aspect is the limbs
 - Respiration was both lungs and skin, needed their skin to be kept wet
 - Lay a huge number of unprotected eggs (like fish)

### Major Changes in Fin-Limb Structure
![[fin-limb_structure.png|300]]
 - Evolve to more advanced morphological types

### Earliest Tetrapods
 - Acanthostega and Ichthyostega spent their life in water
	 - Fundamentally they were aquatic animals
 - Described often as having an amphibious way of life
 - Acanthostega had very thin and many limbs, did not make a ton of use of accumulating oxygen through their lungs
	 - Evolution of chest bone is what makes us different than amphibians, to breathe oxygen
 - Ichthyostega: Spine is better developed, larger ribs, limbs are far more robust to thrust body inland
	 - Wide and large ribs to protect the internal parts of the body (heart and lungs) from attack
	 - Attackers would be other Ichthyostega, assume they were cannibals from the beginning

### Stem Tetrapods
 - Several tetrapod lineages in the Devonian and Carboniferous
 - Acanthostega was more iamphibious in habitat than Ichthyostega, which apeared to have spent more time on land. However they had more than five toes, a feater that made them closer to crossopterygians
 - Pederpes is the first stem tetrapod with five toes, discovered in the Early Carboniferous of Scotland
	 - Important, first organism to have limbs with exactly five toes
