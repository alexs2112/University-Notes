### Stromatolites
 - Circular fossils, claimed to be result of organisms but couldn't prove what organism did it
	 - *Cryptozoon* (hidden organisms)
 - Another discovery of cryptozoon structurs at Schreiber Beach in the late 50s
	 - Around the structures, could see the desseminated organic matter (origin unrecognizable)
	 - Within the cryptozoon structures, could see organic columns
	 - Used magnification up to several thousand times, within these structures could see fossilized prokaryotes 
		 - All of a sudden prokaryote fossils were being noticed everywhere
		 - Extremely diverse: Prokaryote diversification within the stromatolites
 - Precambian micro fossils: Transmitted light microscopy revealed organic debris, first time for fossils before Cambrian period
 - Stromatolites prefer warmer waters, column-like structures situated between tidal zones (center of low and high tide), harsh conditions
	 - Able to figure out the cryptozoons are simply stromatolites
	 - Found living stromatolites in Shark Bay
	 - Photosynthetic
 - Stromatolites are only alive in the uppermost portion, underneath is dead rock
	 - Indicates a vast history in time
 - Many different shapes, apparently controlled by paleoenvironmental factors, such as water depth
 - The study of modern stromatolites showed there are four distinct zones
	 - Sorted from surface towards center
	 - **Growth Surface**: (1mm) Thin layer, highest diversity of organisms, bacteria, cyanobacteria, don't need oxygen to develop their life cycle, produce oxygen, some are photosynthetic
	 - **Undermat**: (1mm) Thin bacterial layer, consisting of non-oxygen producing photosynthetic bacteria, and anaerobic (no oxygen) bacteria that can still use oxygen when available. Amount of bacteria drops off sharply from the growth surface.
	 - **Oxygen-Depleted Zone**: (1-2 cm) Thicker layer, populated by rare anaerobic bacteria
	 - **Stromatolite Mass**: Includes most of the stromatoite, consists of calcium carbonate. No living bacteria and cyanobacteria in this portion of the stromatolite
 - By the neoarchean period, stromatolites achieved global domination. Were everywhere, every river, stream, ocean
	 - Up until this point, stromatolites slowly accumulated around the globe (paleoarchean to end of mesoarchean)
		 - Pre paleoarchean, no stromatolites
	 - Oxygen factories all over the planet
	 - Stromatolites began to reduce in numbers at the start of the Phanerozoic
		 - A group of organisms evolved that were capable of feeding on stromatolites
		 - Entered a period of decline, returned to the patchy distribution. Mostly in salty lagoons, toxic for gastropods (predator of stromatolites)

### Banded Iron Formation - BIF
 - Another kind of sedimentary rock in Isua formation
 - Consists of an alternance of thin (millimeters-centimetes in thickness) of iron oxides (Fe_O_) (hematite, magnetite, etc) and layers consisting of cherts and jaspers (lower iron content)
	 - Layers of reddish rust between layers of greys and greens
 - Formed during volcanic events, iron expelled into the atmosphere, the iron atoms are combined with dissolved oxygen from the oceanic water
	 - Most likely happened in the uppermost layer of water in the oceans, highest concentration of dissolved oxygen
 - Source of molecular oxygen is important, could not have been  released during volcanic events
	 - Most probably source for the free molecular oxygen is from the photosynthetic process
 - Can tell that the Earth's atmosphere transformed from reducing to oxygen filled at this period
	 - A challenging period for life on Earth, most organisms were anaerobic and oxygen was toxic to them
	 - First mass extinction, organisms destroyed by their product (oxygen)

### Oldest Eukaryotes
 - Biomarkers (chemical fossils)
 - Toxic environment, groups of prokaryotes started to cluster and form larger organisms (symbiosis)
	 - Each prokaryote in the new organism was to perform a single function (organelles)
	 - Much bigger than bacteria
 - Evolved a new type of reproduction, sexual reproduction
	 - Mutations and modifications during sexual reproduction causes rapid evolution
 - According to fossils, evolved 1.8 billion years ago
 - Some other records, closer to 2.1 billion years

### Bitter Springs Formation
 - Australia
 - First isolated true eukaryote cells discovered in the cherts here (central Australia)
	 - Dated 1.0 billion years
 - Assigned to the red algae (rhodophytes) and green algae (chlorophytes, Caryosphaeroides and Glenobotrydion)
 - Some of these were caught in the process of cellular division, among the very few cases where even the nucleus and cell membrane were fossilized
	 - Cell arrangement suggests meiotic cell division
	 - Offspring cell unique arrangement during the cellular division indicates that the organisms belong to the eukaryote
	 - Such arrangements not found among the prokaryotes

### Algal Multicellularity
- **Bangiomorpha**
	- Evolution of multicellular organisms
	- Filamentous thallus, similar to those of modern red algae
	- Primitive holdfast attached to the seafloor, allowing the alga to rise upwards towards the sunlight
	- ~1.2 billion years
	- Proterozoic - Quaternary
 - **Melanocyrillium**
	 - Show similarities with the modern group of testate amoebas
		 - Included among the earliest animals
		 - Vase looking mf, wide at the bottom with an open top
			 - Extensions of the cytoplast emerged from the opening to catch food
			 - Animal-like metabolism
	 - Organic, somtimes with agglutinated particles
	 - ~0.8-0.9 billion years
	 - Upper Proterozoic - Quaternary

### Grand Canyon Findings
 - CD Walcott discovered other Precambian fossils
 - Small-sized, black coaly disks, found in carbon-rich shales
	 - Assumed they are flattened shells
 - Today we know they are unusually large, originally spheroidal, single-celled planktonic algae
 - Organisms wanted to increase their size at this time, instead of multicellularity these organisms became a single big cell
	 - As it began to increase in size, new crisis on Earth, average temperature of the Earth dropped
	 - Snowball Earth
	 - 4 Glaciations in the Neoproterozoic
 - In southern part of Africa, able to isolate calcitic cells covered in openings from the Cryogenian period
	 - Animals achieved multicellularity in this time to survive snowball earth
	 - The sponge **Otavia** evolved in the cryogenian, became extinct by the end of it

### Ediacara Fauna
 - Southern Australia, Upper part of the Proterozoic
 - Appear as impressions in fine sediments
 - No traces of organs for a long time
 - Multicellular, look a bit like echinoderms
 - **Parvancorina**:
	 - 1-2.5 cm
	 - Shield-shaped front end
	 - Central axis and weak traces of segmentation
	 - Up to 10 pairs of possible appendages with distinct set of growth stages
	 - Interesting orientation: head shield facing the direction of water current (disputed, for feeding?)
 - **Tribrachidium**:
	 - Unknown affinities
	 - Originally interpreted as a single organism, now interpreted as the holdfast of another organism
	 - 2-5 cm
	 - Disk-shaped with three raised arms and raised borders
	 - Triradial symmetry
 - **Dickinsonia**:
	 - 1-100 cm
	 - Resembles a flatworm, segmented head, tail
	 - No internal organs
	 - The tail only occurs in mature specimens
- **Charnia**:
	- Enigmatic, not sure what it was
	- Strong similarities with the modern sea-pens
	- Bilateral symmetry (stem with matching fronds)
	- Feather-shaped frond with a series of side branches
- After discovering these, began finding them everywhere

### Spriggina
 - Resembles a large swimming worm (3 cm long)
 - Elongated "spine" with V-shaped muscle clusters on each side
 - Hardened head of organic tissue, vestige of cephalic shield
	 - Beginning of cephalization
	 - Why shield? Who are the predators? Not developed for no reason
 - Resembles the first vertebrates, that don't appear for a long time

### Kimberella
 - Complex structure, three peripheral layers full of cavities, central part has a slightly inflated structure
	 - Center structure can be fossilized differently, harder organic tissue
 - Most interesting part: Always found very well defined at one end, other end has no structure (horseshoe shape)
	 - See traces of a grazing organism outside of the empty end (feeding on microscopic organisms)
	 - Was a grazer
	 - No structure at the front of the fossil as it was probably a siphon, sucked in water and rock to consume food before expelling the water
	 - Need a muscle to do so, many mollusks have a siphon
 - Likely ancestor of the mollusks, but very rare, lack of precision

### Vendia
 - Bilateral symmetry, head, lateral parts, tail, no impressions of eyes or mouth
 - Impressions of internal cavity
 - First ediacaran organism found with internal cavities, invertebrates started here

### Onega
 - Body general architecture can be subdivided into three parts: Head, Body, Tail
	 - Extremely similar to Trilobytes
 - 50 million years between Onega and Trilobytes, maybe not ancestor
	 - Need more studies

### Symmetry
 - Body cavities of oldest creatures form radial symmetries
 - As we get closer to the present, body cavities form bilateral symmetries
 - Arrange organisms stratigraphically, organisms start to coagulate into lineages
