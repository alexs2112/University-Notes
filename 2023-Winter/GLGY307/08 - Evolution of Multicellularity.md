### Stromatolites
 - Circular fossils, claimed to be result of organisms but couldn't prove what organism did it
	 - *Cryptozoon* (hidden organisms)
 - Another discovery of cryptozoon structurs at Schreiber Beach in the late 50s
	 - Around the structures, could see the desseminated organic matter (origin unrecognizable)
	 - Within the cryptozoon structures, could see organic columns
	 - Used magnification up to several thousand times, within these structures could see fossilized prokaryotes 
		 - All of a sudden prokaryote fossils were being noticed everywhere
		 - Extremely diverse: Prokaryote diversification within the stromatolites
 - Precambian micro fossils: Transmitted light microscopy revealed organic debris, first time for fossils before Cambrian period
 - Stromatolites prefer warmer waters, column-like structures situated between tidal zones (center of low and high tide), harsh conditions
	 - Able to figure out the cryptozoons are simply stromatolites
	 - Found living stromatolites in Shark Bay
	 - Photosynthetic
 - Stromatolites are only alive in the uppermost portion, underneath is dead rock
	 - Indicates a vast history in time
 - Many different shapes, apparently controlled by paleoenvironmental factors, such as water depth
 - The study of modern stromatolites showed there are four distinct zones
	 - Sorted from surface towards center
	 - **Growth Surface**: (1mm) Thin layer, highest diversity of organisms, bacteria, cyanobacteria, don't need oxygen to develop their life cycle, produce oxygen, some are photosynthetic
	 - **Undermat**: (1mm) Thin bacterial layer, consisting of non-oxygen producing photosynthetic bacteria, and anaerobic (no oxygen) bacteria that can still use oxygen when available. Amount of bacteria drops off sharply from the growth surface.
	 - **Oxygen-Depleted Zone**: (1-2 cm) Thicker layer, populated by rare anaerobic bacteria
	 - **Stromatolite Mass**: Includes most of the stromatoite, consists of calcium carbonate. No living bacteria and cyanobacteria in this portion of the stromatolite
 - By the neoarchean period, stromatolites achieved global domination. Were everywhere, every river, stream, ocean
	 - Up until this point, stromatolites slowly accumulated around the globe (paleoarchean to end of mesoarchean)
		 - Pre paleoarchean, no stromatolites
	 - Oxygen factories all over the planet
	 - Stromatolites began to reduce in numbers at the start of the Phanerozoic
		 - A group of organisms evolved that were capable of feeding on stromatolites
		 - Entered a period of decline, returned to the patchy distribution. Mostly in salty lagoons, toxic for gastropods (predator of stromatolites)

### Banded Iron Formation - BIF
 - Another kind of sedimentary rock in Isua formation
 - Consists of an alternance of thin (millimeters-centimetes in thickness) of iron oxides (Fe_O_) (hematite, magnetite, etc) and layers consisting of cherts and jaspers (lower iron content)
	 - Layers of reddish rust between layers of greys and greens
 - Formed during volcanic events, iron expelled into the atmosphere, the iron atoms are combined with dissolved oxygen from the oceanic water
	 - Most likely happened in the uppermost layer of water in the oceans, highest concentration of dissolved oxygen
 - Source of molecular oxygen is important, could not have been  released during volcanic events
	 - Most probably source for the free molecular oxygen is from the photosynthetic process
 - Can tell that the Earth's atmosphere transformed from reducing to oxygen filled at this period
	 - A challenging period for life on Earth, most organisms were anaerobic and oxygen was toxic to them
	 - First mass extinction, organisms destroyed by their product (oxygen)
