### Overview
 - Age of the Earth: 4.6 billion years old (memorize)
 - Considered outside science to be a controversial topic (opposed to religious accounts)

### Nicolaus Steno
 - Royal Society of London was established in 1660
	 - Beginning of scientists
 - Steno is credited with the establishment of the first principles of stratigraphy.
	 - Studied the rocks of Tuscany, Italy
 - Steno identified two sequences separated by a discontinuity
	 - Discontinuity being an injection of a different rock between two sedimentary layers
	 - Assumed to correspond to Noah's Flood
	 - Principles have been presented in his famous *Prodromus*

### Steno's Principles
1. **Principle of Layer Superposition**
	- Time of formation of the first layer (succession of layers), newly added layers gradually occupy higher places in the succession.
	- Therefore, an undisturbed stratigraphical succession of layers, the oldest layer is at the bottom and the youngest layer at the top.
2. **Principle of Successive Layer Formation**
	- At the time of formation of a layer, only fluid was above it. None of the above existing layers in the stratigraphical succession existed at that time.
	- Some layers have fossils in their formation, none of the fossils present traces of the soft body
		- Correctly indicated that the transformation of a creature into a fossil took a long time
	- Thinking at that time that a layer formed in about 5 or 6 years
		- At least 10000 layers in the succession of layers in Tuscany, at least 50k years
	- Disproves some of the bible, first sign of split between science and the church, although they still worked together at this time
3. **Principle of Original Layer Horizontality**
	- Steno realized that sediments accumulated by the settling of the particles in suspension in a flued
	- Originally, layers were horizontal, but in outcrops they are folded due to crustal disturbance
	- The new form is the result of crustal movements
4. **Principle of Lateral Layer Continuity**
	- Considered layers of the rivers, when a layer is formed it is formed over the entire surface of the basin
		- Does not hold all the time, technically not a principle (sediment deposits from rivers in the ocean, creates new layers that don't go everywhere)
	- Originally deposited strata extend in all directions until they terminate by thinning at the margins of a basin
	- Took into consideration the existence of possible barriers of deposition, or lateral grade into a different sort of sediment
	- Used to find coal

### Layer & Facies Terminations
 - 5 cases to demonstrate how layers are ordered in the Earth's crust
 - In France, these writings were hidden away by the church
 - More writings, church also hid them away, messed with the wrong guy
	 - These ones demonstrated that the Earth's age was 70-80k years, immediately rejected in England as nobody believed the Earth was that young
	 - Never claimed he was true, used these writings as a way to remove creationism from science

### Georges Louis Leclerc - Compte de Buffon
 - In France, published one book, came in contradiction with the church
	 - Church banned his book, big mistake
	 - De Buffon was the head naturalist at the Kings court, rich, influential, smart, wrote another book
 - 1774: First calculation of the Earth's age based on experimental data
	 - Although the result proved wrong, age of ~70k years was considered too young by scientists but was still 10x the biblical age of the Earth
	 - Instantly ended the influence of creationist ideas in science

### Interpreting a Stratigraphical Succession
 - Sedimentological data can be used to decipher the order of depositions of various sedimentary strata
	 - Could it have formed one way, and then been flipped upside down
 - Particular structures such as desiccation cracks (mudcracks) and ripple marks are of great value in recognizing the original position of the sea bottom
	 - Mudcracks form at the surface of the Earth with strong evaporation
		 - Present maximum width towards the upper part of the layer (the opening, cusp)
	 - Ripple marks narrow upwards, form small waves of Earth by the wind
 - Burrowings: Trace fossils from digging organisms looking for food/shelter, opening upwards (can't be dug from the bottom up)
	 - Can use these layers to compare normal stratigraphical successions and inversed stratigraphical succession

### Correlation with Fossils
 - Sir William Smith, first to use fossils and their ranges to correlate layers and successions of rocks, intercontinental correlation
	 - Opens the door for a global timeline
	 - Allowed for a huge jump in scientific knowledge
 - Method can only be successful if the area of distribution of the respective fossils are wide enough to occur in the sections that are to be correlated
 - Some fossils have a huge stratigraphical range, others are restricted to narrow stratigraphical ranges, more useful as index fossils
 - Layers containing the same index fossil can be correlated from one section to another
 - Planktic species are paramount, endemic ones are practically useless
	 - Ocean currents can transport them relatively quickly over long distances, great index fossils
 - Stratigraphical Range: first occurance of a species until their extinction/evolution where they will never show up again

### Stratigraphical Successions of Igneous Rocks
 - Principle of Inclusions
	 - Layers of igneous rocks with inclusions of older layers
	 - Lavaflow picking up detached inclusions of older rocks before crystallizing
 - Principle of Cross-Cutting Relationships
	 - Long inclusion of a younger rock that cuts through an older igneous segment, forming nearly parallel lines (dikes)
	 - Second(+) generation dikes can cut through the older igneous segment along with the first generation dike, younger than both of them.
 - Relative Age of Lavaflows (and Sills)
	 - Layers of igenous rock are younger than the layers below, as the lava flow was so hot it cooked the younger layers beneath it.
		 - Can also cook layers above it, which means it is younger than both surrounding layers (formed by an intrusive rock, injection, cooking both sides)
	 - Sedimentary layers above the igneous rocks can have inclusions

### Geologic Time Scale
**Four Eons**: (Four Eons, Oldest to Youngests)
 - Hadean: No rock record, can't be subdivided
 - Archean: Oldest rocks, highly subjective boundary depending on the oldest rocks we know at the time
 - Proterozoic: Early life forms, oldest fossils, longest in Earth's history. Started when continents moving around the Asthenosphere (plate tectonics, instead of just up and down)
 - Phanerozoic: Visible life forms, begins with large size fossils (no microscope)
	 - Defined by agronomic revolution, formation of burrowers (developing mouths to feed on nutrients in the ground), leading to massive diversification of life forms on Earth. Evolution takes over, shortly after is the first global predator (360* vision)
	 - Cambrian Explosion
**Phanerozoic Subdivisions**: (Three Eras, Oldest to Youngest
 - Paleozoic: Fossils look like aliens, subdivided into seven more periods:
	 - Cambrian: Whales
	 - Ordovician: Ancient Welsh tribes
	 - Silurian: Ancient Welsh tribes
	 - Devonian: England, development of layers of rocks
	 - Mississippian: Mississippi
	 - Pennsylvanian: Pennsylvania, these only recognized in NA (otherwise these two are Carboniferous)
	 - Permian: Russian city in the Euro mountains
 - Mesozoic: Flora and Fauna begin to resemble modern life forms, evolution of mammals who practically took over, reptiles dominate wetter areas. Life diversification.
	 - One big ocean current, Ocean Conveyor, push continents together to form Pangaea
	 - Subdivided into three time periods:
		 - Triassic
		 - Jurassic
		 - Cretaceous
 - Cenozoic:
	 - Ocean Conveyor collapsed, ocean transformed into large swamp, temperature increased, 95% of species died (great dying)
	 - One million years later, Ocean Conveyor restarted and life recovered
	 - Other event: Asteroid, extinction of the dinosaurs, eventual evolution of primates to take over
	 - Subdivided into three time periods:
		 - Paleogene
		 - Neogene
		 - Quaternary

### Radioactive Decay
 - Elements and isotopes in nature present different degrees of stability
 - An unstable isotope nucleus can be transformed spontaneously into an isotope with a stable nucleus configuration
	 - Unstable element changes to a stable state
 - This process is known as radioactive decay
 - Most elements transform over several steps, a radioactive decay series
	 - As you know the series of transformation, you can measure the weight of the parent and daughter isotope knowing the rate of transformation, you can calculate the age of the mineral (1912)

### Half-Life
 - The half-life of a radioactive element represents the time it takes for one half of the atoms of the original unstable parent element to decay to atoms of a new and more stable daughter element
 - Principle of measurement, charts and diagrams showing the ratios of change for each element over time. Not the method itself
 - Uranium 238 -> Lead 206 is the most relevant isotop pair, a half life of 4.5 billion years

### Geological Time Scale
 - With the knowledge of half-life and radioactive decay, we can calculate the age of the Earth with margins of error
