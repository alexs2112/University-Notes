### Overview
 - Age of the Earth: 4.6 billion years old (memorize)
 - Considered outside science to be a controversial topic (opposed to religious accounts)

### Nicolaus Steno
 - Royal Society of London was established in 1660
	 - Beginning of scientists
 - Steno is credited with the establishment of the first principles of stratigraphy.
	 - Studied the rocks of Tuscany, Italy
 - Steno identified two sequences separated by a discontinuity
	 - Discontinuity being an injection of a different rock between two sedimentary layers
	 - Assumed to correspond to Noah's Flood
	 - Principles have been presented in his famous *Prodromus*

### Steno's Principles
1. **Principle of Layer Superposition**
	- Time of formation of the first layer (succession of layers), newly added layers gradually occupy higher places in the succession.
	- Therefore, an undisturbed stratigraphical succession of layers, the oldest layer is at the bottom and the youngest layer at the top.
2. **Principle of Successive Layer Formation**
	- At the time of formation of a layer, only fluid was above it. None of the above existing layers in the stratigraphical succession existed at that time.
	- Some layers have fossils in their formation, none of the fossils present traces of the soft body
		- Correctly indicated that the transformation of a creature into a fossil took a long time
	- Thinking at that time that a layer formed in about 5 or 6 years
		- At least 10000 layers in the succession of layers in Tuscany, at least 50k years
	- Disproves some of the bible, first sign of split between science and the church, although they still worked together at this time
3. **Principle of Original Layer Horizontality**
	- Steno realized that sediments accumulated by the settling of the particles in suspension in a flued
	- Originally, layers were horizontal, but in outcrops they are folded due to crustal disturbance
	- The new form is the result of crustal movements
4. **Principle of Lateral Layer Continuity**
	- Considered layers of the rivers, when a layer is formed it is formed over the entire surface of the basin
		- Does not hold all the time, technically not a principle (sediment deposits from rivers in the ocean, creates new layers that don't go everywhere)
	- Originally deposited strata extend in all directions until they terminate by thinning at the margins of a basin
	- Took into consideration the existence of possible barriers of deposition, or lateral grade into a different sort of sediment
	- Used to find coal

### Layer & Facies Terminations
 - 5 cases to demonstrate how layers are ordered in the Earth's crust
 - In France, these writings were hidden away by the church
 - More writings, church also hid them away, messed with the wrong guy
	 - These ones demonstrated that the Earth's age was 70-80k years, immediately rejected in England as nobody believed the Earth was that young
	 - Never claimed he was true, used these writings as a way to remove creationism from science

### Georges Louis Leclerc - Compte de Buffon
 - In France, published one book, came in contradiction with the church
	 - Church banned his book, big mistake
	 - De Buffon was the head naturalist at the Kings court, rich, influential, smart, wrote another book
 - 1774: First calculation of the Earth's age based on experimental data
	 - Although the result proved wrong, age of ~70k years was considered too young by scientists but was still 10x the biblical age of the Earth
	 - Instantly ended the influence of creationist ideas in science

### Interpreting a Stratigraphical Succession
 - Sedimentological data can be used to decipher the order of depositions of various sedimentary strata
	 - Could it have formed one way, and then been flipped upside down
 - Particular structures such as desiccation cracks (mudcracks) and ripple marks are of great value in recognizing the original position of the sea bottom
	 - Mudcracks form at the surface of the Earth with strong evaporation
		 - Present maximum width towards the upper part of the layer (the opening, cusp)
	 - Ripple marks narrow upwards, form small waves of Earth by the wind
 - Burrowings: Trace fossils from digging organisms looking for food/shelter, opening upwards (can't be dug from the bottom up)
	 - Can use these layers to compare normal stratigraphical successions and inversed stratigraphical succession
