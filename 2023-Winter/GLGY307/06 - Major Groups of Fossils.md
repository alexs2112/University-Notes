### Prokaryotes
 - Representative of Kingdom Bacteria, mostly as Stromatolites
 - Divisions Bacteriophyta and Cyanophyta
	 - Very primitive organisms, vast array of metabolic strategies, mostly single celled, rarely with multicellularity (clustered, grouped but don't form colonies/aren't components of the same organism)
 - Occur frequently in the fossil record

### Plant-like Protistans - Algae
 - Divisions Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta, Charophyta
	 - Rhodophytes: Red algae, very primitive, first multicellular algae, can be single-celled, photosynthetic
		 - Mostly marine, adapted to fresh waters
	 - Chlorophytes: Green algae, can be single celled or multicellular, photosynthetic
		 - Can occur in terrestrial conditions with enough moisture in the soil
	 - Charophytes: Only multicellular, represent ancestors of the land plants (this or fungi)
		 - Female reproductive organs are fossilized due to calcification to protect the egg. Male reproductive organs are not preserved
		 - Good for studying algae evolution

### Plantae
 - Higher plants, extraordinarily complex morphological structure
 - First began showing up in fossil record with the conquest of land, marine organisms moving onto land (90m years long, fungi -> algae -> mollusks -> anthropods -> fishes)
 - Bryophytes, seedless plants, plants with seeds
	 - Leaves are very short and narrow, responsible for processing nutrients and respiration
	 - Ferns, more advanced than modern ferns, seedless plants
		 - Group of ferns eventually evolved through the development of a reproduction method using seeds, no longer exist today (seeded ferns)
 - First land plants, very primitive, height of 5 cm

### Plants - Palynology
 - Pollen: very small, saclike structures on the sides filled with air, low density and can be dispersed by winds easier
 - Don't have mineralized parts, everything is organic
	 - Once they are buried they fossilize quite quickly, organic matter begins to change colour
	 - Changes particularly based on heat, by the colour of the spore fossils we can tell the heat of the rock it was buried on, can tell if a particular rock could generate hydrocarbons (good for oil)

### Animal-like Protistans
 - Never multicellular
 - Metabolic strategy that feeds on other organisms, single-cell predators
 - **Foraminifera**: opening at the top, "bearer of openings", marine, sometimes adapted to brackish/fresh water environments
	 - Very important, protect the cell with a mineralized structure known as test, sometimes one chamber they live in all their life, sometime add additional chambers as it grows
		 - Extremely diverse tests, in looks and minerals it is made of (Calcite, Aragonite, Cement-bound nearby particles)
		 - Causes them to have a very good fossil record, possibly the best one we have
	 - At first, ventic, living at the bottom of the sea (most free, some attached). Very primitive capability of movement
		 - In time, adapted to plantic environment, float freely in the uppermost part of the oceanic water
 - **Radiolarians:** leave behind internal skeletons that serves to support certain parts of the cytoplast (organelles)
	 - Entirely marine, require open oceanic basins
	 - Precipitate organic silica, lots in pacific ocean with a huge number of volcanos, use erupting silica to build their skeletons
 - **Ciliophorans and Choanoflagellates**: Single celled marine organisms, extremely diverse in modern seas and oceans
	 - Cup-like shape, organism lived inside of it with tentacles that emerge from the opening for feeding, lorica (? the cup) chemistry 
	 - Evolved independently of different groups at least 8 times
	 - Choanoflagellate, look almost identicle to tissue cells within a sponge mass (implies evolution)
		 - Can't have evolved, sponges are 600m years, choanoflagellate spore is only 300k years
