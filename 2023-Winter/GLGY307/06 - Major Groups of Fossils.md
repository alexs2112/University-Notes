### Prokaryotes
 - Representative of Kingdom Bacteria, mostly as Stromatolites
 - Divisions Bacteriophyta and Cyanophyta
	 - Very primitive organisms, vast array of metabolic strategies, mostly single celled, rarely with multicellularity (clustered, grouped but don't form colonies/aren't components of the same organism)
 - Occur frequently in the fossil record

### Plant-like Protistans - Algae
 - Divisions Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta, Charophyta
	 - Rhodophytes: Red algae, very primitive, first multicellular algae, can be single-celled, photosynthetic
		 - Mostly marine, adapted to fresh waters
	 - Chlorophytes: Green algae, can be single celled or multicellular, photosynthetic
		 - Can occur in terrestrial conditions with enough moisture in the soil
	 - Charophytes: Only multicellular, represent ancestors of the land plants (this or fungi)
		 - Female reproductive organs are fossilized due to calcification to protect the egg. Male reproductive organs are not preserved
		 - Good for studying algae evolution

### Plantae
 - Higher plants, extraordinarily complex morphological structure
 - First began showing up in fossil record with the conquest of land, marine organisms moving onto land (90m years long, fungi -> algae -> mollusks -> anthropods -> fishes)
 - Bryophytes, seedless plants, plants with seeds
	 - Leaves are very short and narrow, responsible for processing nutrients and respiration
	 - Ferns, more advanced than modern ferns, seedless plants
		 - Group of ferns eventually evolved through the development of a reproduction method using seeds, no longer exist today (seeded ferns)
 - First land plants, very primitive, height of 5 cm

### Plants - Palynology
 - Pollen: very small, saclike structures on the sides filled with air, low density and can be dispersed by winds easier
 - Don't have mineralized parts, everything is organic
	 - Once they are buried they fossilize quite quickly, organic matter begins to change colour
	 - Changes particularly based on heat, by the colour of the spore fossils we can tell the heat of the rock it was buried on, can tell if a particular rock could generate hydrocarbons (good for oil)

### Animal-like Protistans
 - Never multicellular
 - Metabolic strategy that feeds on other organisms, single-cell predators
 - **Foraminifera**: opening at the top, "bearer of openings", marine, sometimes adapted to brackish/fresh water environments
	 - Very important, protect the cell with a mineralized structure known as test, sometimes one chamber they live in all their life, sometime add additional chambers as it grows
		 - Extremely diverse tests, in looks and minerals it is made of (Calcite, Aragonite, Cement-bound nearby particles)
		 - Causes them to have a very good fossil record, possibly the best one we have
	 - At first, ventic, living at the bottom of the sea (most free, some attached). Very primitive capability of movement
		 - In time, adapted to plantic environment, float freely in the uppermost part of the oceanic water
 - **Radiolarians:** leave behind internal skeletons that serves to support certain parts of the cytoplast (organelles)
	 - Entirely marine, require open oceanic basins
	 - Precipitate organic silica, lots in pacific ocean with a huge number of volcanos, use erupting silica to build their skeletons
 - **Ciliophorans and Choanoflagellates**: Single celled marine organisms, extremely diverse in modern seas and oceans
	 - Cup-like shape, organism lived inside of it with tentacles that emerge from the opening for feeding, lorica (? the cup) chemistry 
	 - Evolved independently of different groups at least 8 times
	 - Choanoflagellate, look almost identicle to tissue cells within a sponge mass (implies evolution)
		 - Can't have evolved, sponges are 600m years, choanoflagellate spore is only 300k years

### Animalia: Invertebrates
 - Sponges (poriferans)
 - Cnidarians (include corals and medusa): Colonies/solitary organisms in the oceans, evolved after the great dying (permian/mesozoic boundary)
	 - Quite different than the corals today, primitive
 - Lophophorates (bryozoans and brachiopods): Organ used to catch food
	 - Bryozoans: Known as colonial, long fossil record in marine organisms, colonized brackish and some freshwaters
	 - Brachiopods: Solitary organisms, can cluster together, soft body protected by two valves. Attach to seafloor by organ that comes between the two valves, can be opened and closed. Extraordinarily long fossil record (calcium carbonate, fossilize well)
 - Molluscs: protect soft body with a shell that consists mostly of aragonite, calcite. Wide variability in their appearance and body plan.
 - Arthropods: segmented appendages, body is protected by a carapace. Variable morphology, evolve at high rates. 
	 - Trilobites are particularly important (three parts of their body, tri)
 - Echinoderms: Represent groups of invertebrates with highest diversity, starfish and stuff, soft body protected by thicker test covered by small pieces.
	 - After death of organism, these plates are detached and the rest is disintegrated, rare to find the whole thing together
 - Graptolites: Extinct group, only occur as colonial organisms

### Animalia: Chordates
 - Conodonts: Chewing apparatus fossilize equally
 - Evolved to vertebrates, Haikouichthys is the earliest vertebrate we know of
	 - Ascidians/Tunicates: Microscopic pieces
 - Vertebrates: Fishes, reptiles, birds, mammals
