### Composition
 - Dominant elements in life forms on Earth are:
	 - Carbon
	 - Oxygen
	 - Hydrogen
	 - Nitrogen
	 - Sulphur
	 - Phosphorus
 - Composition did not change, evolved from common ancestor

### Petroleum Composition
 - Persistence of carbon-based composition of life forms on Earth can be tested by studying elemental composition of substances resulting from organic matter decay + transformation in subsurface conditions
 - Natural hydrocarbons, such as natural gas, petroleum, bitumen, waxes, are formed through a succession of processes that begin after the death of organisms of various groups
 - Massive amount of Carbon in these hydrocarbons, Hydrogen, Sulphur, Oxygen all follow

### Living Matter Molecular Composition
 - Most living organisms on Earth have bodies consisting of water molecules (human body is average 70-90%)
 - Interpreted as demonstrating that the life on Earth evolved in aqueous environments
	 - Two hypotheses on the life origins today take in consideration that life emerged in shallow water or in the deeper portions of the oceans

### Monomers, Polymers
 - Evident that oldest rocks completely lack fossils, oldest fossils are known from the Paleoarchean
 - Oldest fossils are bacteria and cyanobacteria, organisms that present an extremely complex structure at molecular level
	 - Thousands of molecule types, including about 500 RNA molecules (extremely complex)
	 - How did simple monomers evolve to this
 - Dominant elements in life forms existed in the early Earth atmosphere in significant amounts
	 - Biogenic elements, existence in primordial cloud where the solar system was formed
 - CHON(SP) elements can easily combine to form simple inorganic monomers
	 - Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Ammonia, Water, etc
 - These monomers have higher molecular masses when compared to those that dominated the terrestrial planets primordial atmospheres
	 - Hydrogen and Helium
	 - Most light gases were removed from the terrestrial planets atmosphere by the solar wind, started with sun ignition
	 - As a result, the concentration in small monomers increased in Earth's atmosphere, pheomenon that further increased the possibility to chemically react, form larger molecular compounds
 - Major problem in understanding chemical reactions in the planet's early history was the chemical character of the atmospher
	 - Modern atmosphere (dominated by nitrogen, large amounts of oxygen O2) could not have favoured the formation of larger, organic molecules due to oxidizing character
	 - Early atmosphere had a reducing character instead

### Primordial Soup
 - Alekxandr Ivanovich Oparin (1894-1989)
 - 1930: First model in which the primordial  atmosphere had a reducing character rather than an oxidizing one
	 - Further observations and experimental data confirmed Oparin's model
 - Organic molecules could have been accumulated at the Earth's surface dissolved in water
	 - Mixture of organic molecules was named Primordial Soup by Oparin
 - Electricity in atmosphere, UV radiation from space, Heat from the Earth, combine to form organisms

### Miller and Urey Experiment
 - Demonstrated that simple monomers can chemically react to form more complex molecules in 1953
 - Considered that Hydrogen was the dominant element in the early Earth atmosphere
	 - Started with a mixture of gases consisting of H2, N2, NH3, CH4, H2O
	 - Energy with electrical discharges and ultraviolet radiation
 - Obtained seven amino acids, including Glycine, Alanine
	 - Also Formaldehyde, Hydrogen Cyanide, Acetylene, Cyanoacetylene

### Polymers
 - Simple organic molecules can react chemically to form larger molecules, consisting of hundreds and thousands of atoms
 - Some large molecules are polymers, formed through the repeating of a monomeric unit
	 - Process which organic monomers chemically combine to form polymers is polymerization
 - Polymers are frequent substances in the living world
	 - Example is cellulose, repeating glucose monomeric unit C6H12O6
**Amino Acid Polymerization**
 - Dehydration Condensation: Two amino acid molecules combine to form a dipeptide molecule
 - Dipeptide molecules combine to form a large polymeric chain, known as protein
	 - Protein is a polypeptide
**Sugar Polymerization**
 - Two sugar molecules combine to form a Disaccharide
 - A chain of disaccharides form a polysaccharide, Carbohydrates
**Nucleic Acid Polymerization**
 - Sugar plus a base forms a Nucleoside
 - When phosphate is added to the nucleoside, it forms a Nucleotide
 - A chain of nucleotides form a Polynucleotide, Nucleic Acid

### Early Earth Events
 - Four major processes happened in the proximity of the early Earth surface, all of them influences the environment
1. Early Crust Formation: Happened due to differences in the temperature between the very hot early Earth and the cold outer space
	- Once the early crust was formed, heat remained trapped at the Earth interior
		- Temperature equal to the surface of the sun
	- Volcanic phenomena was common at the early Earth surface
2. Early Atmosphere Formation: Mixture of gases from two sources: remnants from Solar System formation and new ones from volcanic phenomena
3. Ocean Formation: Happened early due to accumulation of water from vapour condensation
	 - Zircon minerals from Australia (4.4 bya, oldest minerals on Earth) require significant amounts of water
4. Catastrophic Meteorite Bombardment: Documented in early history of celestial bodies from inner Solar System
	 - Effects can be seen at the surface of the Moon, Mercury and Mars
		 - Surface of these are not affected by plate tectonics, craters are still visible
	 - Plate tectonics on Earth obliterate the vestiges of this catastrophic series of events
	 - Can infer that this meteorite bombardment happened at the interval between 4.2 and 3.95 bya

### Oldest Organic Matter
 - Evidence of chemical and biochemical phases of evolution are hard to find in the rock record
	 - Molecules don't fossilize
 - Discovery from metamophosed sedimentary rocks (3.7-3.8 bya) of the Isua Formation of southwestern Greenland
	 - Demonstrates validity of our experiments and assumptions on the chemical and biochemical evolution of life on Earth

### Isua Formation
 - Dark appearance, indicates they deposited in a reducing environment
 - Small sized calcite minerals are disseminated within the rocks, demonstrates that molecular oxygen only existed in small amounts so true layers of calcitic rocks could not form
 - Formed in shallow marine environment
 - Thin layers of graphite occur in these rocks
	 - Final product of organic matter transformation in subsurface conditions during burial process
	 - Thin layers interpreted as possibly representing the fossilized vestiges of the primordial soup
 - Indicates living isolated organisms in primordial soup, created the oxygen that formed calcite minerals
	 - Organisms were missing from the formation
 - Oldest Stromatolites:
	 - Known from certain levels of the Isua Formation
	 - Formed by communities of prokaryotes
	 - Oxygen created by the anaerobic bacteria in the stromatolite, they are destroyed by fossilization

### Oldest Isolated Bacteria and Cyanobacteria
 - Cyanobacteria are slightly larger in the fossil record, don't differ much in morphology
 - Oldest fossils on Earth were discovered in the Apex Chert
	 - Lithological unit part of a volcano sedimentary unit of the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia
 - Apex Chert rocks consist of conglomerates that were transformed into chert through the process of silicification
 - Earliest cyanobacteria debris of isolated cells found in the Apex Chert, age approximated to ~3.465/3.5 Billion Years
 - Some of the cells from the Apex Chert show folded filament with cell-like structures made of carbon
	 - Similar to modern iron bacteria
 - Strelley Pool Chert:
	 - Younger than the Apex Chert by 10-15k years, not very much younger
	 - Contains bacteria and cyanobacteria
	 - Form chain-like structures, similar to modern purple bacteria
	 - Prokaryotes in clustered form
 - More stomatolites begin to occur and cluster at a higher rate
