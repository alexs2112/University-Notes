# Chordate Evolution
 - Represented by the notochord rodlike structure, very thin but flexible

### Burgess Shale - Pikaia
 - 5 cm long
 - Cephalocordate
 - Long time believed is the earliest representative of the chordate group
 - Similar to the modern lancelet, differs by having a pair of small antennae at the head
 - Tapering tale probably used for swimming, long guy

### Chengjiang Fauna
 - China, equivalent, slightly older than the Burgess Shale
 - From the **Early Cambrian**
 - Some examples:
	 - **Yunnanozoon**: True chordate, occurs in vast numbers
	 - **Myllokunmingia**: Chordate that starts making a transition to the true vertebrates, has a weird notochord
	 - **Haikouichthys**: Very well developed vertebral column. The first vertebrate, very well documented in the history of life
	 - **Cheungkongella**: First tunicates (benthic and plantic, oldest ascidian). Attached to seafloor with thin notochord
 - Very well defined segment from the lower -> lower-middle Cambrian documenting the evolution of vertebrates

### Conodonts
 - Conodont (conical teeth) first occurrence in the stratigraphic record is in the upper Cambrian
 - Found pieces of chewing apparatus of an unknown organism, occurred abundantly in micropaleontological samples
	 - Originally thought to be fishes
	 - Sometimes found these pieces in the stomach of some fishes, thought to be a chewing mechanism inside the stomach of those fishes
		 - Almost nobody accepted this, too weird
	 - Maybe they ate those fish with these chewing apparatus
 - **Chemical and Minerological Composition**:
	 - Dominated by apatite (calcium phosphate) with a trace of organic matter
		 - Just like the bones of vertebrates
		 - Trace of organic matter is particularly important, originally conodonts had a transparent aspect. Once buried, the organic matter begins to cook, changes colour
		 - Conodont colour varies with heat, conodonts then can be used to estimate sediment depth of burial (extremely interesting, economic benefit)
 - Very diverse, very simple to very complex
 - Not distributed in a layer, concentrated in small zones
	 - Each small "conodont" that was found in one area was actually a part of the Life Assemblage of the extremely complex chewing apparatus of a single conodont animal
	 - Symmetric chewing apparatus
 - **Conodont Types**:
	 - Morphological types of these conodonts (pieces)
		![[conodont_types.png|450]]
 - **Conodont Growth**:
	 - Three types of growth, in order of growing complexity through evolution
	 - When looking at the ring at the base of the growth, we realized we know what they are
	 - Some small worms have spines around their mouths, some spines look similar to these growths. These worms only exist in the modern seas and oceans (chaetognatha)
	 - ![[conodont_growth.png|300]]
 - **Conodont Ancestors**:
	 - **Mongolodus**: Also had these spines
 - **First Discovered Conodont Animal**:
	- Cephalochordate, chordate with a head
	- Somewhat more evolved Pikaia
	- Conodonts evolved independently of those vertebrates in the Chengjiang fauna
- **Conodont Extinction**:
	- Conodonts evolved very rapidly during the Paleozoic
	- Descendants of the chaetognath worms (arrow worms)
	- Strongly affected numerically at the Permian/Triassic boundary
	- Became extinct at the Triassic/Jurassic boundary
- **Reconstruction of the Conodont Animal**: 
	- Ate at the bottom of the ocean, plenty of food (scavenger)
	- Small sized, few centimeters, with big eyes and cephalochordate-like organism

# Agnathan Evolution
### Most Primitive Modern Fishes
 - Cyclostomes, parasitic way of life (lampreys)
 - Lack of a jaw (agnathan)

### **Sacabambaspis**
 - Earliest agnathan
 - Discovered in Bolivia
 - Headshield with 20 protective plates, 20 cm long
 - Fishlike aspect, very well developed protective structure of wide bony plates (~20)
 - Likely a filter feeder, moved at the bottom of the ocean filtering the bottom of the sediment for food
 - Extremely slow swimmer, assured prey for the predators at this time, but managed to survive

### **Astraspis**
 - Oldest North American vertebrate, 15 cm long
 - Anterior shield, consisting of many bony plates (small scales)
 - Eyes migrated from anterior position (very front) to the lateral position (sides of the head), much wider range of vision to spot predators
 - Still a filter feeder

### **Osteostracans**
 - Evolved a cephalic shield consisting of one piece, robust and extremely resistant
 - Could take hits from the major predators at the time (sea scorpions)
 - New organ to sense the approach of predators, sensing the sea vibration of predators long before they could be seen
 - Evolved a cerebellum, had memories and knew where to go
	 - Reproduction: Migrated inland into coastal areas, far away from sea scorpions, could hatch and return to the sea in larger numbers
	 - Safety in numbers
	 - Knew exactly where to go to hatch and then return to sea, the sea scorpions could follow them but did not have their own memories

### Heterostracans
- In contrast with ostreostracans, evolved flat bodies
- Adapted to the bottom of the sea, probably still a filter feeder
- The armored plates are very well separated for different portions of the body

### Thelodonts
 - Drastic reduction of the cephalic shield
 - Important genus: **Lanarkia**, just like the Heterostracans but evolved earlier. First agnathan to have a dorsally compressed body (thin guy)
	 - Followed afterwards by several hundred genera of fishes
 - Example: Furcacauda
	 - Tail with many distinct parts, looks like a ton of individual tails all off the back
