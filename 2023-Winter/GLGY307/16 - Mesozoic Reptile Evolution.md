### Aquatic Reptiles
 - Two distinct groups of marine reptiles in the Mesozoic times
 - Triassic: Placodonts (order Placodontia) and nothosaurs (order Sauropterygia)
	 - Placodonts:
		 - Triassic blunt-toothed shell crushers (broad inner teeth behind the outer teeth)
		 - Broad armor resulted in the appearance of a large turtle
			 - Bony structure on the bottom resembling ribs, protect ventral sides of the body from cutting edges of shells
	 - Nothosaurs:
		 - Example: Ceresiosaurus (2.2 meters long)
		 - Not fully aquatic, only plunged periodically in the water for food
 - Jurassic-Cretaceous: Plesiosaurs (order Sauropterygia) and ichthyosaurs (order Ichthyosauria)
	 - Plesiosaurs:
		 - Long necked fish eater, long neck to trick prey (undulating to disorient prey)
		 - Example: Futabasaurus (famous fossil in Japan)
	 - Ichthyosaurs:
		 - Fish lizards, top predators in the Jurassic and Cretaceous seas, relatively small  (few meters)
		 - Best adapted to the aquatic environment (similar to dolphins)
		 - Extremely fast, anterior paddle-like libs
		 - Large skull armor to protect the eyes, likely from other ichthyosaurs
		 - Example: Leptonectes
		 - A bunch of them were buried by underwater landslides, mother caught in process of giving birth
			 - Give birth to living offspring, no eggs
			 - Reproductive strategy close to dolphins and sharks

### Reptilian Non-Dinosaurian Flight - Pterosaurians
 - Evolved flight several times, not a single reptilian group
 - Pterosauria: Winged lizards
 - Includes circa 200 (now 400) species of flying reptiles that lived during the upper Triassic-Cretaceous stratigraphic interval
	 - Pterosaurian age corresponds to that of the dinosaurs
 - Most likely a polyphyletic group, defined by grouping together taxa that evolved iteratively the winged morphology
 - **Flight Capabilitiies**:
	 - Representatives were considered to be gliders from higher places
		 - Small-sized species likely used trees to start the gliding
		 - Larger ones started glided flight from a cliff or a falaise
	 - Originally thought their bodies would be too heavy, thinking in reptilian sense
		 - Turns out their bones were hollow, big creatures but very light
		 - Flight capabilities were reevaluated, demonstrated some species could have actively moved their wings during flight, making them highly maneuverable in the air
 - **Adaptations**:
	 - Hollow bones, lighter and occur in all groups that have flight capabilities
		 - Heads in the pterosaurian group are streamlind
	 - Body was covered with hair, as demonstrated in the case of *Sordes pilosus*, species from late Jurassic from Kazakhstan
		 - Very good preservation, portions of its body covered with fur
		 - Bodies covered with hair are clear indication that pterosaurians evolved endothermy
			 - Warm blooded
	 - Wings consisted of extended skin, attached to the modified arm skeletal elements over the whole length; wings could be moved through the action of massive pectoral muscles
 - Extremely diverse in terms of feeding:
	 - Dimorphodon: Insectivores, manythin-narrow teeth
	 - Rhamphorhynchus: Fish eaters, like seagulls, hair on the beak and claws
	 - Ctenochasma: Fed on plankton at the surface of the ocean, skimmed it off the top
	 - Pteranodon: Very streamlined head, no teeth, large beak like a pelican, swallowing fish whole

# Terrestrial Reptiles
### Triassic Diapsid Takeover
 - Most significant change in reptilian faunas of the Triassic was the overall replacement of the synapsids by diapsids
 - Earliest diapsids evolved in the Carboniferous
	 - Oldest genus: Petrolacosaurus, small sized insectivore
 - Not among the flourishing and dominant reptiles of Carboniferous and Permian, but colonized a variety of environments, adopting different feeding strategies
 - Diversification began in the late Permian, two major groups evolved in the Traissic:
	 - Lepidosaurs (lizards, snakes, etc)
	 - Archosaurs (crocodiles, etc)
 - Two main groups are formalized as Lepidosauromorpha and Archosauromorpha

### Lepidosauromorphs
 - Remained terrestrial and quadrupedal since their evolution in the early Triassic
	 - Not among the dominant reptiles in the Mesozoic
 - Squamates (order Squamata): Lizards and snakes
 - Squamates evolved in the Jurassic, became diversified at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary
	 - Evolved gigantism (Titanoboa: 1m tall, 100ft/30m long, probably fish eater, size for warm climate)

### Superorder Dinosauria
 - **Generalities**:
	 - Group of Mesozoic reptiles, evolved in the Triassic
	 - Typically diapsid, from a strict morphological point of view present similarities with the crocodilians and birds
		 - Evolved to have more sophisticated skulls, larger number of holes
	 - In Jurassic and Cretaceous, dinosaurs were the dominant land vertebrates, evolution resulted in the occurrence of some of the largest animals in the life history on Earth
 - **Classification**:
	 - Fundamental structure in the skeleton is the form and orientation of the pubis bone
		 - Significant contribution in deciphering the dinosaurian evolution and classification
	 - Two groups of dinosaurs: Orders Saurischia and Ornithischia (somewhat birdlike and lizardlike)
	![[dinosaur_orders.png|400]]
 - **Saurischian Dinosaurs**:
	 - Present pubis bone oriented downward and forward from the articulation from the ilium and ischium (other two bones in the pelvic girdle)
	 - Divided into three suborders:
		 - Staurikosauria
		 - Theropoda
		 - Sauropodomorpha
	 - Name indicates that the pelvic girlde of the dinosaurid grouphas resemblances to that of the modern lizards
