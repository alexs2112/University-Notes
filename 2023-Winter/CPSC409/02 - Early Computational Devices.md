### Finger Counting
 - Sum digits...
 - Binary digits
 - Chinese finger notation: The individual joints of each finger along with the left, center, and right parts can be used to represent quantities
	 - Requires two hands, one hand to represent all values, the other hand to point at the required value

### Abacus
 - Chinese Abacus
	 - For each multiple of 10: 5 beads to represent 1s, 2 beads to represent 5s
	 - Invalid to have five 1s instead of one 5
	 - Invalid to have two 5s instead of one 1 on the next column
 - Japanese Abacus
	 - For each multiple of 10: 4 beads to represent 1s, 1 bead to represent 5s
	 - Same thing as above but without the invalid states
 - European Table Abacus
	 - A long table with rows for 1s, 10s, 100s, 1000s, etc, in between these values there are spaces for 5s, 50s, 500s, 5000s, etc
	 - Use pebbles to represent different quantities of values
	 - Can draw this out basically anywhere, don't need an actual abacus, just some dirt and rocks

 - Influence:
	 -  Until recently, used widely
	 - Romans: Pebbles used were called calculi, from which calculus and calcuate are derived
