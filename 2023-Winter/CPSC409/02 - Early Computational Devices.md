### Finger Multiplication
 - Memorize multiplication tables up to 5x5
 - Method in slides

### Finger Counting
 - Sum digits...
 - Binary digits
 - Chinese finger notation: The individual joints of each finger along with the left, center, and right parts can be used to represent quantities
	 - Requires two hands, one hand to represent all values, the other hand to point at the required value
	 - 10k max

### Abacus
 - Chinese Abacus
	 - For each multiple of 10: 5 beads to represent 1s, 2 beads to represent 5s
	 - Invalid to have five 1s instead of one 5
	 - Invalid to have two 5s instead of one 1 on the next column
 - Japanese Abacus
	 - For each multiple of 10: 4 beads to represent 1s, 1 bead to represent 5s
	 - Same thing as above but without the invalid states
 - European Table Abacus
	 - A long table with rows for 1s, 10s, 100s, 1000s, etc, in between these values there are spaces for 5s, 50s, 500s, 5000s, etc
	 - Use pebbles to represent different quantities of values
	 - Can draw this out basically anywhere, don't need an actual abacus, just some dirt and rocks
	 - [Retrieve image from slides]
 - Influence:
	 -  Until recently, used widely
	 - Romans: Pebbles used were called calculi, from which calculus and calcuate are derived

### Astrolabe
 - Two (sometimes three) dimensional representation of the celestial sphere
 - Used for many different purposes:
	 - Mapping the position of celestial bodies
	 - Measure latitude / Determining approximate location
	 - Determine time
	 - Estimate the height of objects
	 - Casting of horoscopes

### Gunter's Quadrant
 - Edmund Gunter: 1581-1626
 - The quadrant was based on the astrolabe
	 - Astrolabe - circular
	 - Quadrant - Folded into a quarter circle
	 - Gunter's Quandrant was used to solve the same sort of problems as the Astrolabe.

### The Proportional Compass
 - Used by draftsmen to reduce and enlarge drawings in any given proportion
 - Two crossed arms, one arm slides down the others to copy an image bigger

### The Sector
 - Independently there were many publications that described this device
 - The most widely copied version was created in Padua (1606, Galileo)
	 - Early writings indicate that Galileo was working on the device in 1597 or earlier

### Geometric and Military Compass
 - Name provided by Galileo Galilei
 - Initially used to solve artillary calculations that affected the range

### The Gelosia Method of Multiplication
 - Probably origins: India and later Arab, Persian, Chinese societies by the middle ages

### Napier's Bones
 - John Napier, born in 1550 Scotland
	 - Best known for the invention of logarithms
 - Napier's Bones:
	 - Known by various names: Rabdologia (after book title), numbering rods
	 - Constructed of bone-like material (ivory, horns, actual bones)
	 - Used to perform multiplications and calculate logarithms
 - An array of numbers from 0-9, each number is a column on a bone

### Genaille-Lucas Rulers
 - Background
	 - Henri Genaille: worked as a civil engineer for a railway
	 - Edouard Lucas: a French mathematician
 - Their ruler
	 - Similar to the Napier Bones, didn't require the operator to remember the carry
	 - Each column represents a digit
	 - Rearrange the individual columns in order to determine the results of a multiplication
	 - Starting at the appropriate row (one operand in the multiplication) in the last column find the first digit of the product (first digit in the row)
	 - Working left, follow the arrows to the next digit of the product until the entire product has been calculate

### Logarithms
 - John Napier has always been given credit because other developments were either unpublished or unrecognized
 - Logarithm of a number: the exponent that the base has to be raised to in order to produce that number
	 - log_2(16) = 4 (2^4 = 16)
 - Logarithmic tables have been used to simplify complex calculations and are used for multiplication apparently

### Slide Rulers
 - Mechanical implementations of the logarithmic tables
	 - Many people were given credit
 - Can be used to perform many mathematical operations: multiplication, division, trig, roots, powers

### William Oughtred
 - 1574? - 1660
 - Not "doer  of tricks"
	 - Derided the use of tools while also developing them himsels
 - One of the leading mathematicians of his time
	 - Taught for free, focused on work instead of eating, sleeping
 - Clergyman or mathematician

### Modern Slide Ruler
 - Invented in 1850 by 19 year old French artillery officer Amedee Mannheim
	 - Moveable cursor was actually used in a slide rule designed 200 years earlier for the British navy, ignored and forgotten until "invented" again by Mannheim
