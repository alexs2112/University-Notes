### Charles Babbage (1791-1871)
 - Considered to be the grandfather of the computer age
 - Technology of the day was primitive, his ideas were advanced
	 - Speed of his devices matched technology decades into the future (1940s)
	 - Zuse and Aitken machines
 - Background:
	 - Born into a wealthy banking family, didn't need to worry about surviving
		 - Time to be a productive researcher
	 - Excelled at his work, primarily in computation devices but also other areas, analytical theory
	 - Member of the Royal Astronomical society, founder of the Royal Statistical society
 - Research:
	 - Very active researcher, published papers in many many fields
	 - Optics, Atmospheric observations, Electricity and magnetism, Operation of life insurance companies, Cryptography, Geology, Metal working, Taxation systems, Design and operation of lighthouses
 - Childhood:
	 - Broke new toys very quickly by deconstructing them
 - Adulthood:
	 - Interests and curiosity were not limited to mechanical devices
	 - Wanted to confirm his beliefs (christianity), tried to summon satan
	 - Another experiment to prove the existence of god
 - Mathematician:
	 - Went to boarding school
	 - Snuck out in the night to check out the math textbooks by candlelight
 - College:
	 - Babbage's father decided he should attend Cambridge
	 - Hired a tutor to prepare him for what to expect in college
		 - He was useless, "don't drink the wine"
	 - At Cambridge, learned he had a deeper knowledge of mathematics than his tutors
	 - Spent most of his time reading papers of great mathematicians, meeting with other advanced students
		 - Group translation with George Peacock, John Herschel
		 - Translated and added substantially to a calculus textbook by LaCroix, became the English standard
 - Recreation:
	 - Didn't spend all his time studying, had a very active social life
	 - Chess club
	 - Cambridge ghost club (proving existence of ghosts)
	 - Extractors club (required proof that you are sane and insane)
	 - Bored at school kept creating social clubs
 - Post College:
	 - Did not receive recognition while studying at Cambridge
	 - Unsuccessfuly sought lectureship appointments at university (not enough contacts)
	 - Eventually he was elected as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in Cambridge
		 - Outstanding chair holders: Isaac Newton, Charles Babbage, Stephen Hawking
		 - Initial reaction was neither enthusiastic nor positive, bitter in his old age
		 - Friends convinced him to accept the position, still mad at Cambridge
 - Continental Europe
	 - Well-known and respected in the rest of Europe
	 - Elected as a member to at least 15 European scientific societies
		 - Eventually named commander of the Italian Orders of Saint Maurice and Saint Lazarus
 - Dedicated Researcher:
	 - In Italy, wanted to study the active volcano at Mount Vesuvius
 - Contributions to Logarithms
	 - In 1826, published his own set of logarithms, by far the most accurate published up to that date
	 - Improved on the accuracy but he was a perfectionist, wanted to reduce the chances of misreading the information, experimented with different: (beyond thorough)
		 - Typefaces to improve readability, decrease probability of errors
		 - Paper colours (151)
		 - Colours of ink (13)
 - Contributions to the British Rail System:
	 - Invented the cow catcher
	 - Recovery of lost rail cars, decoupled trains that detach, realized it happened during very windy days, rigged a sail above the rail car
