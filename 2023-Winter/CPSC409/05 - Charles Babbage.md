### Charles Babbage (1791-1871)
 - Considered to be the grandfather of the computer age
 - Technology of the day was primitive, his ideas were advanced
	 - Speed of his devices matched technology decades into the future (1940s)
	 - Zuse and Aitken machines
 - Background:
	 - Born into a wealthy banking family, didn't need to worry about surviving
		 - Time to be a productive researcher
	 - Excelled at his work, primarily in computation devices but also other areas, analytical theory
	 - Member of the Royal Astronomical society, founder of the Royal Statistical society
 - Research:
	 - Very active researcher, published papers in many many fields
	 - Optics, Atmospheric observations, Electricity and magnetism, Operation of life insurance companies, Cryptography, Geology, Metal working, Taxation systems, Design and operation of lighthouses
 - Childhood:
	 - Broke new toys very quickly by deconstructing them
 - Adulthood:
	 - Interests and curiosity were not limited to mechanical devices
	 - Wanted to confirm his beliefs (christianity), tried to summon satan
	 - Another experiment to prove the existence of god
 - Mathematician:
	 - Went to boarding school
	 - Snuck out in the night to check out the math textbooks by candlelight
 - College:
	 - Babbage's father decided he should attend Cambridge
	 - Hired a tutor to prepare him for what to expect in college
		 - He was useless, "don't drink the wine"
	 - At Cambridge, learned he had a deeper knowledge of mathematics than his tutors
	 - Spent most of his time reading papers of great mathematicians, meeting with other advanced students
		 - Group translation with George Peacock, John Herschel
		 - Translated and added substantially to a calculus textbook by LaCroix, became the English standard
 - Recreation:
	 - Didn't spend all his time studying, had a very active social life
	 - Chess club
	 - Cambridge ghost club (proving existence of ghosts)
	 - Extractors club (required proof that you are sane and insane)
	 - Bored at school kept creating social clubs
 - Post College:
	 - Did not receive recognition while studying at Cambridge
	 - Unsuccessfuly sought lectureship appointments at university (not enough contacts)
	 - Eventually he was elected as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in Cambridge
		 - Outstanding chair holders: Isaac Newton, Charles Babbage, Stephen Hawking
		 - Initial reaction was neither enthusiastic nor positive, bitter in his old age
		 - Friends convinced him to accept the position, still mad at Cambridge
 - Continental Europe
	 - Well-known and respected in the rest of Europe
	 - Elected as a member to at least 15 European scientific societies
		 - Eventually named commander of the Italian Orders of Saint Maurice and Saint Lazarus
 - Dedicated Researcher:
	 - In Italy, wanted to study the active volcano at Mount Vesuvius
 - Contributions to Logarithms
	 - In 1826, published his own set of logarithms, by far the most accurate published up to that date
	 - Improved on the accuracy but he was a perfectionist, wanted to reduce the chances of misreading the information, experimented with different: (beyond thorough)
		 - Typefaces to improve readability, decrease probability of errors
		 - Paper colours (151)
		 - Colours of ink (13)
 - Contributions to the British Rail System:
	 - Invented the cow catcher
	 - Recovery of lost rail cars, decoupled trains that detach, realized it happened during very windy days, rigged a sail above the rail car
 - Social Life Beyond College:
	 - Active social life
	 - Well-known member of London Society (eagerly sought after by the London elite)
	 - Often had to turn down invitations
	 - Guests were always treated displays of scientific or technical terms
	 - Designed the first environmental control for a residential dwelling in London (AC)
 - Social Life: Later Years:
	 - As he got older, social agenda diminished, developed a cantankerous attitude towards life
	 - Massive bitch, ran for political office to ban street performers
 - International Connections
	 - Not appreciated by common people of England
	 - Strong reputation in the academic community on both sides of the Atlantic
	 - Offer to travel to the US to teach for a year, the ship he was going to use sank and he never planned to go to the states again

### The Need for Accuracy
 - During late 1700s, publication of mathematical tables began to be commonplace
 - Ranged from calculating results of simple operations to more complex ones (logarithms, trig)
 - Creation of tables were intended to reduce labour, always full of errors
 - After the French Revolution (late 1700s), new French Government decided it would publish a new set of mathematical tables (prestige)
	 - Best French mathematicians were brought on to oversee the project
	 - Work of performing the actual calculations were filled with the unemployed
	 - To ensure accuracy, numbers were computed at least twice by different groups located in different locations scattered across France (prevent collaboration)
	 - The tables still contained errors
	 - Sometimes tables of errata needed to be published, the still contained errors
 - Some of these errors were introduced during type setting, this is why Babbage was so meticulous
 - The tables completed by Babbage in 1827 were the most accurate set of tables produced at that time
	 - Only 40 errors
 - Other tables were not nearly as accurate
 - The only fool-proof method of preventing errors was to remove people entirely from the task of producing the calculations, substitute them with some sort of mechanical device

### Using Differences
 - Once the main tool used by the makers of mathematical tables
 - Replaces more complex operations (multiplication) with additions and subtractions
 - The change in values of a function on X for each X value, to just add the expected differences per X value as long as the differences is a constant
	 - Keep finding differences of differences for higher functions until they are constant
 - Examples on page 18: [Babbage 1](https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~tamj/2023/409W/notes/babbage/babbage_part1_difference_2_per_page.pdf)

### Difference Engine
 - Computing device that is able to employ the property of differences to compute a series of numbers
 - Mr E. Klipstein included the first reference to such a device (1786)
	 - Described computing engine, appendix reference to writings by Captain J.H. Muller he describes a more ambitious computing device if more money were available
	 - Muller credited with the first publication
	 - Klipstein wrote a full publication including Mullers work

### Babbage Difference Engine: Motivations
 - Intense obsession with accuracy and completeness
 - One goal to produce more accurate math tables
 - Ideas of a Difference Engine in 1812 during Cambridge
	 - Face down in the library thinking about it
 - In early 1820s, experience with publishing a table of logarithms he was spurred to design a machine to automate these tables
 - Managed to produce a working model by 1822
	 - Could work with 6 figure numbers, able to evaluate any function having a constant second difference
	 - 44 calculations per minute
 - To generate additional funding and support, Babbage wrote the president of the Royal Society
 - Royal Society supported his project, sent a letter of support to the Lords of the Treasury
	 - Not actual financial support, also not unanimous
	 - Government provided start up funds of 1500 pounds
		 - Used 3400 pounds of his own wealth planning on being reimbursed (handshake deal)
 - Soon discovered there is a big difference between making a demonstration prototype and a fully working model
 - Able to obtain the services of Samuel Clement
	 - Not formally educated, one of the best at trades
	 - Together Babbage and Clement went through many iterations

### Babbage Difference Engine:  Life During Design
 - While they worked on different parts, Babbage suffered from a number of personal tragedies over 4 years
	 - Death of wife, newborn baby daughter, father
 - Result in health breakdown and problems with the project
	 - Took vacation at warmer climate
	 - Checked his account, problems with trying to get a reimbursement from the government (no contract)
 - Needed to begin negotiating with a new government
 - Personal appeals from his friends, project was advanced an additional 1500 pounds, still not enough
 - Very influential friend: Duke of Wellington (Napoleon), project advanced another 3000 pounds with suggestion that Babbage show evidence of his progress
 - Financial and health problems would often significantly delay work on the project
