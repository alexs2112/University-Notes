### World War II: Code Breaking and Computing
 - The Allies:
	 - British code breaking machines/projects
	 - Machines of the Bletchley Park ("bombs")
	 - The Robinsons
	 - The Colossus (and the Colossi)
 - The Axis:
	 - The enigma machines (commercial versions, scaled down, purchased by other nations, Poland -> England)
	 - Later: Geheimschreiber (secret writer)

### The Enigma
 - Developed by Germany between the two world wars (WWI: 1914-1918, WWII: 1939-1945)
 - Designed to convert ordinary language (plain text) into an encoded (encrypted form) to be sent via radio or telephone lines
 - Two versions: One for the military, one for business
	 - Commercial machines were made publically available in 1927
	 - German military began to use the Enigma code on one of their radio stations in 1928
 - The sheer number of possible encryption combinations (100 billion) made mere possession of the machines useless)

### The Allies: Decrypting the Enigma Encryption
 - Simply possessing one of the Enigma machines wasn't sufficient, nor was it sufficient to know the code settings used for a particular time
 - Poland:
	 - When the German military began to braodcast radio transmission (1928) using the Enigma encoded messages, the Polish radio operators alerted the Cipher Bureau
	 - Polish Cipher Bureau: Purhcased and modified a commercial copy of the Enigma
	 - 1928-1931: Litte headway was made, project was abandoned
	 - 1932: Martin Rejewski; Mathematician assigned to study the encryption problem again
	 - Initial efforts resulted in some success and additional people were added to the project
		 - ~75% of German messages deciphered
		 - Encryption technology race between Polish and German technological developments
 - 1939: Evident that war was imminent, the policy of appeasement was not working
	 - The Poles called a meeting of the intelligence agencies of Poland, France, England
	 - France and England were impressed by the Poles (who managed to get a military level Enigma)

### The British Code and Cipher School
 - Worked on deciphering the German codes at Bletchley Park outside of London
 - Intelligence work involved a great deal of secrecy
	 - Information on a need to know basis
	 - Even know most of the information is still classified under the Official Secrets Act
 - Combination of secrecy surrounding the work at Bletchley Park and the code names used
	 - "Work on bombs" (decrypting machines) resulted in a great deal of confusion
 - The British constructed several new versions of their own bombs, based on the Polish original

### Alan Turing (1912 - 1954)
 - Distinguished British Mathematician from Cambridge
 - After graduation, remained to work at the college and produced a famous paper
	 - On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungs-problem
	 - His work was known to scholars throughout the world
	 - 1936: He spent the year at Princeton (met Einstein, von Neumann)
 - During the war he worked at Bletchley Park as a code-breaker
	 - Contributed to the design of the machinery as well as applying his mathematical knowledge
	 - An eccentric person
	 - A pure scholar

### The Robinsons
 - 1942: Staffing levels at Bletchley Park were such that different sections were formed
	 - Each section was housed in a "hut" that would do different problems (possibly the same problems but with different approaches)
	 - Only the hut supervisors would communicate
	 - Most people didn't even know what they were working on
 - By this time the bombs were too slow to be used in the decryption process, new techniques needed to be developed
 - General Post Office (Telephone Division)
	 - Dollis Hill, West London
	 - Mr T.H. Flowers: Head of group working on telephone switching problems
	 - Commissioned several pieces of machine to be built for the people at Bletchley Park, people building them didn't know what they were working on
		 - What the Dollis Hill people thought: Designing new photoelectric paper tape reader to be used in a new telegraph
 - M.H.A. Newman:
	 - Envisioned a new machine that could automate a part of the decryption process
	 - Dr C.E. Wynn-Williams: Known for his previous work, designed the machine envisioned by Newman
 - Machine Name: Heath Robinson (unusual device named for an unusual cartoonist)
 - Known Specifications:
	 - Much of the information is still classified, some details have been released
	 - Partly implemented using vacuum tubes and telephone relays
	 - Not a general purpose computer
	 - Evaluate some boolean operations on information read from two endless loops (punched paper)
 - Quickly Constructed:
	 - Unreliable
	 - Proof of Concept: Proved high speed electronic devices could still aid in the decoding process, not reliable enough to actually be used
	 - At least three machines constructed: Heath Robinson, Peter Robinson, Robinson and Cleaver

### The Colossus
 - Mr. T.H. Flowers (London Post Office: Tape Reader Project)
	 - Brought directly into the project as an electronics expert to help redesign the Robinson machinery to make it more reliable (vacuum tubes over relays)
	 - Completely new electronic design (1500 vacuum tubes) was used
 - First job given to the machine was completed in 10 minutes (The Savior Machine hailed as The Colossus)
 - Some of the known specifications (many still classified)
	 - Bi-quinary storage of information in the registers
	 - Internal clock was used to synchronize operations
	 - Controlled by a plug board and wires
	 - Card readers (Robinsons) were used as input
 - Due to foresight and very good planning, the second Colossus machine was built in less than a year
	 - First colossus completed in Dec 1943
	 - March 1944 was demoed,  Many more produced before June 1944
 - Believed that up to 10 were fully functional at the end of the Second World War
 - Eventual fate of most of the machine sis still unknown
	 - One machine moved to Iran (Russia: Cold War)
 - Similar to the Robinsons: The Colossi were required to complete high speed Boolean operations on data read from tape
 - In some ways the forerunner of the modern computer
	 - Basic mathematical operations can be implemented via boolean logic, in theory the machines could be general purpose
	 - Conditional branching possible: Different plug board instructions could be executed depending upon a value stored in one of the registers

### American "Bombs"
 - Few details are available
 - One of the last remaining American bomb code breakers resides at the National Museum of American History (Smithsonian Institution)
	 - Copy (identical?) of British machines
 - Other hints at American code-breaking efforts
	 - Alan Turing visiting the US during the war (Bell Labs)
