### World War II: Code Breaking and Computing
 - The Allies:
	 - British code breaking machines/projects
	 - Machines of the Bletchley Park ("bombs")
	 - The Robinsons
	 - The Colossus (and the Colossi)
 - The Axis:
	 - The enigma machines (commercial versions, scaled down, purchased by other nations, Poland -> England)

### The Enigma
 - Developed by Germany between the two world wars (WWI: 1914-1918, WWII: 1939-1945)
 - Designed to convert ordinary language (plain text) into an encoded (encrypted form) to be sent via radio or telephone lines
 - Two versions: One for the military, one for business
	 - Commercial machines were made publically available in 1927
	 - German military began to use the Enigma code on one of their radio stations in 1928
 - The sheer number of possible encryption combinations (100 billion) made mere possession of the machines useless)
