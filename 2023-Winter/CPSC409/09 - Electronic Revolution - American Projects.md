### Computing Technology (Pre WWII - WWII)
 - Computers prior to this period were entirely mechanical or electromechanical in their design
 - World War II: The electronics industry (radio) was given a tremendous boost
 - Many people independently thought of using electronics in a calculating machine, costs were high
	 - First attempt: Schreyer and Zuse
	 - First prototype: Atanasoff and Berry
	 - First fully working machine: Mauchly and Echert
 - This type of technology would derive its results using electronics 
	 - Non-mechanical, mechanical parts were incidental rather than a key part of the calculation

### The ABC (Atanasoff-Berry Computer)
 - John Atanasoff: Professor at Iowa State College
 - Clifford Berry: Graduate student studying under Atanasoff
 - **Motivations**:
	 - Atanasoff was researching methods for solving complex physics equations
	 - Drudgery of using the calculators motivated him to create something better
	 - Started by modifying the small IBM calculator leased to the college
	 - Extensive modifications, staff at IBM weren't happy with the modifications
	 - Atanasoff's experiencecs with modifying the IBM tabulator convinced him that mechanical-based technology was unlikely to have the necessary speed and durability
	 - Decided to build his own machine, more of a daunting task than first anticipated
	 - After particularly frustrating night, decided to take a break from the lab, leading to a breakthrough: Used to have a book of binary, thought about it. 
		 - Decided to use a binary two-state system instead of the current decimal system
		 - Drove the 200 miles back to write it down in the middle of the night
 - After enlisting the aid of Berry and several years of hard work, the ABC was nearly completed at the cost of $6000 (including $450 paid to Berry) in 1942
	 - The first *prototype* electronic computer
 - At this time the US was involved in the second World War, the government demanded trained technical people to join the war effort
	 - In 1942 Atanasoff left the project (Naval Ordnance Laboratory)
	 - The ABC never did become fully operational
 - The first machine to incorporate regenerative memory that was similar to the kind used in modern D-RAM (memory needs to constantly be refreshed or else it loses its charge)
	 - Not a stored program computer
 - **Rotating Drum Memory**: A pair of drums, each containing capacitors that rotate on a common shaft once per second. The capacitors on each drum were organized into bands of 50, speed of 30 additions/subtractions per second (30 bands, 2 additional spare bands)
	 - Rotating refreshed the charges in the capacitors
 - **Technical Specifications**:
	 - Arithmetic unit: 300 vacuum tubes (addition and subtraction)
	 - Control and memory: 300 vacuum tubes
 - **Controversy**:
	 - The fate of Atanasoff and Berry, hard to get credit for it
	 - Who developed the first electronic computers? (these guys or the creators of the ENIAC)
		 - ENIAC was derivative of the ABC
	 - Getting the stamp on their work
		 - Atanasoff wanted to get a patent for the technology, filing issues, didn't file it immediately and done improperly
		 - Brought it to court to get the patent -> get credit for it
	 - Berry: Generally thought it was a suicide, Atanasoff never accepted the suicide verdict and tried to investigate on his own
		 - Didn't have anybody else to collaborate the technology story with
 - **Significance**:
	 - First to demonstrate the use of electronics in a digital calculating machine (excluding Helmut Schreyer and Konrad Zuse)
	 - First to incorporate regenerative memory

### The ENIAC
 - **Place**:
	 - 1923: Moore School of Electrical Engineering was founded
	 - Many prominent researchers would visit the school (Vannevar Bush, John von Neumann)
	 - 1930: School enters relationship wiht the US Army (Aberdeen Proving Ground: Maryland)
	 - First project: Constructing another Differential Analyzer
		 - Funded by the government (research proving ground)
		 - 2 machines (one for Aberdeen, one for Moore)
		 - Bush loaned his chief designer to the project
		 - Finished in 1934
 - **Calculating Ballistic Trajectories**:
	 - The following were known and constant: 
		 - Gun type and size, type of shell being fired, charge of propellant used, elevation of the gun
	 - Great deal of variation in real life
		 - Guns ranged from ~5" to 18.1" (or more in rare cases)
		 - Possible elevations where battles have taken place (sea level up to the mountains)
	 - Firing solution could be calculated from a ballistic table
		 - Contain solutions to 3000 trajectories
		 - Longer range guns would have to consider other factors: Air pressure, humidity, wind
	 - A skilled operator using a desk calculator could complete the results of a *single* trajectory in 20 hours
		 - 3000 trajectories in one table
		 - 40 hour work weeks -> 1500 weeks
		 - Many women were recruited to fill in the tables
	 - Computers of the day (Differential Analyzer) could complete the results in 20 minutes (excluding set up time)
		 - These calculations excludes the requirements of the US Navy
 - **People Behind the ENIAC**:
	 - **John Mauchly** (1907-1980): Developed designs for the ENIAC
		 - Received the Engineering Scholarship of the State of Maryland
		 - 1925: Enrolled in Engineering at John Hopkins University
		 - 1927: Enrolled for and directly transferred to the PhD physics program
		 - 1933-1941: Professor of physics at Ursinus College
	 - **J. Presper Eckert** (1919-1995): Designed individual circuits of the ENIAC
		 - Came from a wealthy family, great aptitude for mathematics
		 - Enrolled in Wharton Business school at the University of Pennsylvania
		 - Transferred over to the Moore School of Engineering
			 - Worked on radar technology, improved speed + accuracy of school's Differential Analyzer
		 - 1941 became a laboratory assistant for a defense training summer course in electronics (funded by US Department of War)
	 - **Joseph Chedaker**: Supervised the construction team

### Meeting of Mauchly and Eckert
 - Physics professor at Ursin College and a lab instructor at the Moore School (government sponsored electronics course)
 - When some staff positions became vacant at the Moore School (war) Mauchly was recruited into the engineering school

### Atanasoff and the Moore School
 - December 1940: American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting, Atanasoff and Mauchly first met
	 - Impressed by Atanasoff's work
 - Summer 1941: Mauchly visits Iowa State college to see the work being done on the ABC

### Publications
 - August 1942: Mauchly wrote his ideas in a paper, "The Use of High Speed Vacuum Tube Devices for Calculating"
	 - Contrast of electronic vs mechanical approaches:
		 - Differential Analyzer: 15-30 minutes
		 - Electronic machine: 100 seconds (1.67 minutes)
	 - Reaction at the time did not realize the significance, didn't think it was important
	 - One year later, developments on electronics and they needed the paper

### The War Effort and the Moore School
 - The calculation of ballistic tables was falling too far behind
 - April 9, 1943: Meeting between the Moore School and the Ballistic Research Laboratory people
	 - Mauchly and Eckert attempted to reconstruct the paper of notes made by Mauchly's secretary
	 - Moore Schoole: Proposed the name "Electronic Numerical Integrator"
	 - Mauchly: Focused on the general use of the machines, more than just integrals
	 - Army: Add the phrase "and Computer"
	 - Thus the name: Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer was used, ENIAC
 - January 1944: Design of the machine was complete enough, actual progress could be made on the machine itself (rather than on test circuites)
 - July 1944: Two accumulators, power supply, signal generator could perform simple calculations
 - Unknown: Complete and fully working, many later modifications were often just improvements
 - Work on the project began in May 31, 1943
	 - Factory workers built the hardware, Chedaker (electecians) wired it all together. Eckert constructed the logic circuits. All using Mauchly designs
	 - Lt. Herman H. Goldstine to get parts through the army

### Presper Eckert: Contributions
 - Younger member of the team (he was virtually a TA)
 - Considerable hands on experience from radar research
	 - Instead of going with the elegant and new solutions, went with brute force solutions that were proven to work (less risk)
 - Little work time was wasted

### The ENIAC: Results
 - It was huge, the entire room. 100x bigger than other machines of the time
 - The most complex bit of electronics ever put together, comparable to the US telephone network
 - **Dimensions**: 8' high x 3' wide x 100' long
 - **Weight**: Many tons
 - **Energy consumption**: 140 kilowatts
 - **Vacuum tubes**: Original design: 5000 needed, completed design: 18000 used (along with 1500 relays, 10000 capacitors)
 - **Costs**: Original budget cost: $150k, actual cost: over $486k
