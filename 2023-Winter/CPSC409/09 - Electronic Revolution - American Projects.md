### Computing Technology (Pre WWII - WWII)
 - Computers prior to this period were entirely mechanical or electromechanical in their design
 - World War II: The electronics industry (radio) was given a tremendous boost
 - Many people independently thought of using electronics in a calculating machine, costs were high
	 - First attempt: Schreyer and Zuse
	 - First prototype: Atanasoff and Berry
	 - First fully working machine: Mauchly and Echert
 - This type of technology would derive its results using electronics 
	 - Non-mechanical, mechanical parts were incidental rather than a key part of the calculation

### The ABC (Atanasoff-Berry Computer)
 - John Atanasoff: Professor at Iowa State College
 - Clifford Berry: Graduate student studying under Atanasoff
 - **Motivations**:
	 - Atanasoff was researching methods for solving complex physics equations
	 - Drudgery of using the calculators motivated him to create something better
	 - Started by modifying the small IBM calculator leased to the college
	 - Extensive modifications, staff at IBM weren't happy with the modifications
	 - Atanasoff's experiencecs with modifying the IBM tabulator convinced him that mechanical-based technology was unlikely to have the necessary speed and durability
	 - Decided to build his own machine, more of a daunting task than first anticipated
	 - After particularly frustrating night, decided to take a break from the lab, leading to a breakthrough: Used to have a book of binary, thought about it. 
		 - Decided to use a binary two-state system instead of the current decimal system
		 - Drove the 200 miles back to write it down in the middle of the night
 - After enlisting the aid of Berry and several years of hard work, the ABC was nearly completed at the cost of $6000 (including $450 paid to Berry) in 1942
	 - The first *prototype* electronic computer
 - At this time the US was involved in the second World War, the government demanded trained technical people to join the war effort
	 - In 1942 Atanasoff left the project (Naval Ordnance Laboratory)
	 - The ABC never did become fully operational
 - The first machine to incorporate regenerative memory that was similar to the kind used in modern D-RAM (memory needs to constantly be refreshed or else it loses its charge)
	 - Not a stored program computer
 - **Rotating Drum Memory**: A pair of drums, each containing capacitors that rotate on a common shaft once per second. The capacitors on each drum were organized into bands of 50, speed of 30 additions/subtractions per second (30 bands, 2 additional spare bands)
	 - Rotating refreshed the charges in the capacitors
 - **Technical Specifications**:
	 - Arithmetic unit: 300 vacuum tubes (addition and subtraction)
	 - Control and memory: 300 vacuum tubes
 - **Controversy**:
	 - The fate of Atanasoff and Berry, hard to get credit for it
	 - Who developed the first electronic computers? (these guys or the creators of the ENIAC)
		 - ENIAC was derivative of the ABC
	 - Getting the stamp on their work
		 - Atanasoff wanted to get a patent for the technology, filing issues, didn't file it immediately and done improperly
		 - Brought it to court to get the patent -> get credit for it
	 - Berry: Generally thought it was a suicide, Atanasoff never accepted the suicide verdict and tried to investigate on his own
		 - Didn't have anybody else to collaborate the technology story with
 - **Significance**:
	 - First to demonstrate the use of electronics in a digital calculating machine (excluding Helmut Schreyer and Konrad Zuse)
	 - First to incorporate regenerative memory
