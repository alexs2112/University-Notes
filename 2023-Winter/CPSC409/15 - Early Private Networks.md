### CompuServe
 - Classmates Jeff Wilkins, John Goltz set up a time sharing service: CompuServe Networks Inc, as part of the Golden United Life Insurance company
 - Goltz served as the first president
 - The network was built using lines that were leased from AT&T
 - Using proprietary network hardware and software, their network outperformed AT&Ts
 - Unlike traditional timeshare, CompuServe developed programs that were installed on CompuServe's computers and managed by their staff
	 - Clients paid extra to use them
 - Also experimented with performing information products:
	 - Database of an extensive list of consumer merchandise
 - Company was successful, only flaw was that 50% of the time the network was idle
 - Microcomputer users (available since the early 1970s) became a market
	 - People bought modems with the microcomputers even though there was little to connect to: 110-300 bps
 - At the same time, prices of mainframes began to drop sufficiently, companies began to buy rather than timeshare
 - CompuServe had idle computers and a local phone number in almost every city
 - Wilkins saw three things to draw in microcomputer users to CompuServe:
	 - Speed and ower of the mainframes
	 - Storage: At the time nobody made harddrives for micros (floppy drives cost almost as much as the computer ~$500) so most data was stored on tape
		 - CompuServe's mainframes used several 20 MB hard drives
	 - Communication: Email and a public bulletin board system where users could read and leave public messages under different threads
	 - Ability to purchase and download software
		 - No computer store could stock them all, CompuServe provided greater selection
		 - Games were text only and considerably smaller (StarTrek was the most popular one)
 - Initial user group consisted of technically-minded people who could/would program for the network
	 - At first they tried free access for these early adopters
 - 1979: Implemented pay only: $9 startup fee, $5/hour during off hours, $12/hour primetime
	 - 100 bps (regular), 300 bps (premium), eventually upgraded to 1200 bps
	 - In these days, $3-4 would pay for a movie
 - Command line interface like the micro computers of the time
	 - Menu interface developed quickly when more users connected

### The Source
 - Founded by Bill Von Meister
 - Technical whiz kid
	 - Alarm of approaching dad to make some tea
 - An entrepreneur: Started 9 companies in 10 years, longest he stayed at was 2 years, forced out of most of them
	 - Liked the excitement of starting a new company but not the drudgery of running one
 - Envisioned a system: InfoCast
	 - Sometime after 1978 when FCC legalized the public piggybacking of digital data on FM radio broadcasts
	 - Send news, weather, business, sports reports from a central location to FM stations around the country via PSNs (Packet Switched Networks) and phone lines
	 - The company DBC (Digital Broadcast Corporation) was formed to produce and market InfoCast
 - Homes would receive broadcasts through rented receivers
 - Users would be able to send data, even exchange messages
 - Jack Taub and Consolidated Industries of America provided financial backing (1978)
 - Von Meister soon realized it wasn't feasible to outfit millions of American households with receiver/transmitters (and infrastructure to broadcast/decode)
	 - Would require hundreds of millions of dollars
	 - Wireless connections through cellular signals wasn't an option
 - He got GTW Telenet (later SpringNET) to provide their network on off peak hours
 - For Telenet, their upfront cost was nil (no risk)
 - Customers would pay $100 signup fee and $4.60/off hour
	 - Regarded as a bargain
	 - $100/hour for access to the New York Times Information Bank
 - CompuCon (Von Meister's network) was to provide but not create content (third parties like New York Times, Prentice Hall, Dow Jones would do so)
	 - Provided information, messaging, games (all produced by others)
 - Interface: Choice of text menu or command line
 - Went live in late spring 1979, not as CompuCon but as The Source
 - Acted like the early web
 - By Oct 1979 DBC (company behind the Source) was bogged down in $5m in debt
	 - Taub fired Von Meister
 - Technical problems: only 80-100 could log in at a time, time lags of up to 10 seconds during peak hours
	 - Solutions were a year away
 - Some customers left for CompuServe, some returned back to the Source because it was familiar to them and there was a sense of community
 - Eventually Taub himself was fired from the Source, retained control of DBC
 - Taub reorganized the company as NIU (National Information Utilities)
	 - System was to broadcast computer games and other programs
		 - Might also be the ability for subscribers to record their favourite TV programs for a fee
	 - The idea went nowhere
 - Eventually CompuServe bought out the Source
	 - Memberships were terminated, members could become CompuServe members and get some free time
