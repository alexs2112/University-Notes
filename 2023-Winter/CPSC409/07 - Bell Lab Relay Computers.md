### The Need for Complex Numbers
 - Design of electrical devices and apparatus (telephone lines) involves extensive calculation and manipulation of complex numbers
	 - Awkward to work with complex numbers on a standard computer
	 - Telephone company (Bell) developed a specialized computer to work with these values
	 - Problems involving the calculation of complex numbers began to hamper growth

### George Stibitz (1904-1995)
 - York, Pennsylvania
 - Bachelors degree from Denison University, Masters degree from Union COllege (1927), PhD in Mathematical Physics in 1930 from Cornell University
 - Later years (1980s-1990s) turned to non-verbal uses of the computer
	 - Computer art: Commodore Amiga
	 - Art on display at Denison University
 - 1937: Mathematician working for Bell labs
 - Noticed a similarity between telephone circuit diagrams and binary numbers
 - In spare time with cast-off parts he would experiment with electronics

### The Bell Relay Based Computers
 - Stibitz prototype (1938)
	 - Battery powered
	 - Power -> Relays -> Output
 - Dr TC Fry (Head of Stibitz group) happened to be notified of the problems the company was having dealing with its calculating load

### The Complex Number Calculator
 - Work began in late 1938 after SB William was appointed to oversee the project
	 - Stibitz came up with the idea
	 - Williams had the necessary engineering training to design the relay circuits
 - Completed Jan 8, 1940, remained in daily use until 1949
 - Operations on complex numbers: Add, subtract, multiple, divide
 - Operation:
	 - Keyboard operator, type in the calculation into an actual terminal which is sent to the complex number calculator through phone lines
	 - Output then printed out
 - Significance:
	 - First machine to allow for more than one terminal connection, other terminals could connect to it but were given a busy signal (would have to wait for it to be freed up)
	 - Remote access to the machine at a vastly difference through the landlines
 - Details:
	 - Only required 450 telephone relays
	 - Logic was simplified by using a special form of binary (Binary coded decimal)
		 - Harder UI for the operators, easier for the design of the hardware logic
		 - Operators were cheap, hardware was expensive
