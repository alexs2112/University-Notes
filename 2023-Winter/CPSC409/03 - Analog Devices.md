### Digital vs Analog
 - Digital devices are classified as having a finite number of states
 - This is in contrast with analog devices, continuum of possible states

### Astrolabe
 - Old computing device used to solve problems related to time and navigation
 - Projection of the map of the sky (a dome) on a 2d surface
 - Timeframe:
	 - Used in the Arab empire (~600-1600 AD)
	 - Hints of earlier usage, evidence is not definitive
 - Parts:
	 - Outer Backing: Mater/"Mother"
		 - Backing plate to put it all together
	 - Metal: Plates/"Climate" or "Tympanum"
		 - Plate system of the sky as seen at a certain latitude
	 - Cut-away Disk: Rete/"Net/Network"
		 - Positions of the stars
 - Common Uses:
	 - Time keeping: use the sun's position when at a certain latitude to determine the time of day
	 - Determining the current latitude for navigation
 - Process
	 - Select a star in the sky, measure it's altitude by checking a ruled line on the device
	 - Rotate the rete so that the stars correspond with the measuring
	 - Something on it will point to the current time
 - Today:
	 - Development of more accurate mechanical clocks (such as Galileo's conceived pendulum clock ~1600s) reduced the need for the astrolabe
	 - Mostly viewed as a historical curiosity, souvenir versions can still be purchased cheaply

### Antikythera Device
 - Discovery: 1900 by Greek sponge fisherman who found a shipwreck near the island of Antikythira
	 - Dove for sponges, found shipwreck
 - Contained Greek statues, artifacts, lump of encrusted bronze
 - Uses:
	 - Deteriorated condition due to years in salt water. Exact usage is unknwon
	 - Speculated to be device reported by Roman philosopher Cicero, used to reproduce the positions of the sun, moon, and some planets
 - Rotating disks, each disk has a pointer that points towards the position of sun, moon, planets
	 - Inner ring of zodiac, outer ring of 365 days
	 - Turning a dial on the end moves the disks to model where the planets will be
		 - Sometimes forwards, sometimes backwards
		 - Contains a bunch of advanced gears, needed to be extremely precise to not jam the gears and to keep the  machine accurate
 - Significance:
	 - Originated from Roman times, yet contained gearing mechanisms that did not reappear in Europe until much later in 1500 years
		 - Unparalleled precision, comparable to an automobile

### Differential Analyzer
 - Manually determining the area under a curve is cumbersome and inaccurate
	 - Needed if you have the curve but don't have the function that produced it
 - Early attempts to devise mechanical mechanisms for solving these problems were hindered by the limited ability to obtain accurately machined parts
 - Vannevar Bush (MIT) was the first to actually produce a working machine (late 1920s, early 1930s, publication 1931)
 - Resembles a foosball table (sort of...)
	 - Large table with rods across it, mechanical cylinders rotate the rods and draw a curve
 - Relies heavily on mechanical movement to generate results, "programming" and debugging the computational device is challenging
 - The method of solving differential equations was so successful that at least 5 copies were made (ex: Manchester University)
 - Military Application:
	 - Ballistics research with artillery and rocket trajectories
	 - World War II Norway: Shortly after the successful German invasion
		 - Oslo University
	 - World War II MIT: Differential Analyzer was used to solve ballistic trajectories
		 - The range of the shell exceed any artillery piece at the time, research was needed
