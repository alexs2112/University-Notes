### Common Attributes of Early Mechanical Computers
 - Almost all mechanical calculators were composed of these basic elements:
	 - Set up: Allows the number to be entered
	 - Selector: Determines the type of operation (addition, subtraction)
	 - Registering Mechanism: Indicates the value of a stored number (results)
	 - Carry Mechanism: Determines that any carries are handled properly
	 - Control Mechanism: Ensures that the gears are properly aligned at the end of each operation (avoid false results, jamming)
	 - Erasing Mechanism: Resets the result register between operations
 - The 6 parts weren't always separate, but one part could implement multiple operations

### Propagating the Carry
 - Major challenge that was overcome with varying degrees of success in the earliest of calculating machines (Shickard - Grillet)
	 - Non-usse for the 3 commercially produced devices as it had been long solved
 - Manually propagated in an abacus

### Wilhelm Schickard (1592 - 1635)
 - Rennaissance man often compared to da Vinci, well-rounded
 - Professor of Hebrew, Oriental languages, Mathematics, Astronomy, Geography
 - Hobbies: Painting, mechanic, engraver, very good at these things
	 - Asked to engrave things for other people (friends with Kepler)
 - Developed the first true adding machine that could handle a carry 
	 - Bruno von Fretag Loringhoff, history specialist + prof, ascertained that Shickard had developed the machine
	 - Machine was lost, only have schematics left over
	 - Evidence: Letter sent to/from Johannes Kepler, mechanical equivalent of his manual calculations
	 - Loringhoff was able to produce the working machine

### Shickard Machine
 - Reconstructed by Professor Bruno Baron von Freytag
 - Carry Mechanism
	 - Result of additions to a previous column passed in next column
	 - Solution: Single-toothed gear
	 - Wasn't sure if this was actually implemented in the physical device
 - Fate of Shickard's calculators
	 - Built two machines, one was for Kepler, burned down in a house fire
	 - Unknown what happened to Shickard's calculator, believed his family died in a plague and it was unceremoniously disposed of (burned as scrap wood)

### Blaise Pascal
 - Pascal's wager
| |Exists|Does not exist|
|---|---|---|
|**You believe**|Infinite Win|No cost/Finite cost|
|**You do not believe**|Infinite Loss|No cost/Finite cost|
 - Critique: assumes there is only one thing to believe in, what is "no cost"
 - Modern context: Climate change
 - Born in Southern (Clermont) France
 - Many accomplishments, some of the stories about his life were greatly accomplished
 - Credited as the next major attempt to produce a calculating machine
	 - Initially credited as building the first mechanical calculator, disproved by Loringhoff
 - "Homeschooled" in the basics of reading and writing by his father Etienne Pascal
	 - After the basics, left to learn from reading the library of his father
	 - Learned math, father told him to not read those math books
	 - Made a deal with his dad: studied his fathers curriculum, rewarded by being allowed to read the math books
 - Motivations:
	 - His family members were government tax collectors
	 - The calculations required were repetitive and tedious
	 - How can we do things better? Create a computational device
	 - At 19 he designed his first calculating machine (1642), although attempts to find someone to implement the design was unsuccessful
 - Other Vocations:
	 - Failed to get others to build his designes, he would have to work as designer and the builder of the designs
	 - Trained in other vocations, metalworking and mechanics
 - First Machine:
	 - Went through nearly 50 prototypes, all based on the original design
	 - In 1645 he publically presented the machine (Pascal's Calculator, later Pascaline)

 - Carry:
	 - Realized the gear and tooth mechanism used by Shickard was problematic, a carry that propagated for more than several digits would require too much force and could damage the gears
	 - Put together a complex system of falling weights
 - Fate of his machines:
	 - Several machines were produced but sales weren't profitable
	 - Few survive to today as they were quite delicate
	 - He suffered from illness and died at 39 (1662)

### Gottfried Leibniz (1646 - 1716)
 - Age 15: Admitted to University Leipzig for Law
 - Age 20: Applied for his doctorate for Law, was declined due to his age
	 - Eventually doctorate awarded at the university of Altdorf
 - [look into how this actually works...]
 - Leibniz's Calculating Machine: Gear based system (not single tooth gears) for carries
	 - They were still problematic, ripple carry through several digits had to be manually propagated
	 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klLB5k3LkwU
 - End Years: Respected for his universal genius, he was very difficult to get along with and people waited for him to die (only one person mourned him)
 - Leibniz, Pascal both tried to construct these machines on their own but were unsuccessful
 - Leibniz was able to enlist the aid of M. Oliver, who was a clock maker and had the skills to construct his machine

### Operations Available:
 - Addition: Shickard, Pascal, Leibniz
 - Subtraction: Pascal, Leibniz
 - Multiplication & Division: Leibniz

### Samuel Morland (1625-1695)
 - Political strife in England, attended university at an older age
 - Received BA from university, usual profession was in the clergy but instead took up Mathematics
 - Capable mechanic, invented several devices
 - Adding/Subtracting Machine:
	 - Implemented a partial (manual) carry
		 - Shickard's carries propagated multiple times could damage the machine, Pascal's carry was delicate and sometimes unreliable
		 - Pocket calculator
	 - Auto Carry Morland Machine: None were actually constructed/survived to modern times
	 - Also designed another machine for multiplication, division, square and cube roots (based on Napier's bones)

### Rene Grillet
 - Very little is known about him
	 - One source: Appointed clockmaker to very prestigious position to a royal
	 - Second source: His working machine was exhibited in country fairs for a silver
 - In 1678 he published information about his calculating machine, although it was short on details (marketing brochure)
 - Some additional details came from a manuscript from Charles Babbage (discovered by Michael R. Williams)
	 - Morland's machine had the more useful mechanism Napier's bones (for multiplication) while Grillet's had the larger capacity adding mechanism

### Commercially Produced Machines
 - Thomas Arithmometer
 - Baldwin-Odhner Machines
 - Key-Driven Machines: Comptometers

### The Thomas Arithmometer (1820s, ~1914)
 - M. Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar applied modern engineering and design practices to the Leibniz mechanism
 - Thomas created an industry in which mechanical devices were used to aid in calculation
 - However the device was fairly large: Big footprint, not very portable, heavy

### Baldwin-Odhner Machines (1885 - ~1965)
 - Consisted of two different sets of machines
	 - US: Frank S. Baldwin (Baldwin machines in America)
	 - Russia: W. T. Odhner (Odhner machines in Europe)
 - Used a variable toothed gear with different number of potruding teeth, the teeth didn't go all the way around the cylindric gear, made it more compact
 - It was a 4 function calculator that could now sit on the corner of a disk
 - Consisted of rows of cylindric gears that could store a whole number
	 - The Leibniz machine could only store one digit per gear, far less compact
 - The UI was still too awkward and time consuming for general office tasks (ie, adding up long columns of numbers)

### Key Driven Machines
 - Mr Dorr E. Felt was the person who made a functional key driven machine, Comptometers:
	 - Prototype completed NYD: 1885
	 - First fully working model completed: Autumn 1886
 - Macaroni Box, required inputting pins into the top to input numbers
	 - Production model had a bunch of buttons that required a button per digit, Key Driven
	 - The UI was far better, sped up the addition operation by an order of magnitude above everything else
