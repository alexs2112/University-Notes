### Common Attributes of Early Mechanical Computers
 - Almost all mechanical calculators were composed of these basic elements:
	 - Set up: Allows the number to be entered
	 - Selector: Determines the type of operation (addition, subtraction)
	 - Registering Mechanism: Indicates the value of a stored number (results)
	 - Carry Mechanism: Determines that any carries are handled properly
	 - Control Mechanism: Ensures that the gears are properly aligned at the end of each operation (avoid false results, jamming)
	 - Erasing Mechanism: Resets the result register between operations
 - The 6 parts weren't always separate, but one part could implement multiple operations
