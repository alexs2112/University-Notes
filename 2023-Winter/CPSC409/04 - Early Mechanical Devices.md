### Common Attributes of Early Mechanical Computers
 - Almost all mechanical calculators were composed of these basic elements:
	 - Set up: Allows the number to be entered
	 - Selector: Determines the type of operation (addition, subtraction)
	 - Registering Mechanism: Indicates the value of a stored number (results)
	 - Carry Mechanism: Determines that any carries are handled properly
	 - Control Mechanism: Ensures that the gears are properly aligned at the end of each operation (avoid false results, jamming)
	 - Erasing Mechanism: Resets the result register between operations
 - The 6 parts weren't always separate, but one part could implement multiple operations

### Propagating the Carry
 - Major challenge that was overcome with varying degrees of success in the earliest of calculating machines (Shickard - Grillet)
	 - Non-usse for the 3 commercially produced devices as it had been long solved
 - Manually propagated in an abacus

### Wilhelm Schickard (1592 - 1635)
 - Rennaissance man often compared to da Vinci, well-rounded
 - Professor of Hebrew, Oriental languages, Mathematics, Astronomy, Geography
 - Hobbies: Painting, mechanic, engraver, very good at these things
	 - Asked to engrave things for other people (friends with Kepler)
 - Developed the first true adding machine that could handle a carry 
	 - Bruno von Fretag Loringhoff, history specialist + prof, ascertained that Shickard had developed the machine
	 - Machine was lost, only have schematics left over
	 - Evidence: Letter sent to/from Johannes Kepler, mechanical equivalent of his manual calculations
	 - Loringhoff was able to produce the working machine

### Shickard Machine
 - Reconstructed by Professor Bruno Baron von Freytag
 - Carry Mechanism
	 - Result of additions to a previous column passed in next column
	 - Solution: Single-toothed gear
	 - Wasn't sure if this was actually implemented in the physical device
 - Fate of Shickard's calculators
	 - Built two machines, one was for Kepler, burned down in a house fire
	 - Unknown what happened to Shickard's calculator, believed his family died in a plague and it was unceremoniously disposed of (burned as scrap wood)

### Blaise Pascal
 - Pascal's wager
| |Exists|Does not exist|
|---|---|---|
|**You believe**|Infinite Win|No cost/Finite cost|
|**You do not believe**|Infinite Loss|No cost/Finite cost|
 - Critique: assumes there is only one thing to believe in, what is "no cost"
 - Modern context: Climate change
 - Born in Southern (Clermont) France
 - Many accomplishments, some of the stories about his life were greatly accomplished
 - Credited as the next major attempt to produce a calculating machine
	 - Initially credited as building the first mechanical calculator, disproved by Loringhoff
 - "Homeschooled" in the basics of reading and writing by his father Etienne Pascal
	 - After the basics, left to learn from reading the library of his father
	 - Learned math, father told him to not read those math books
	 - Made a deal with his dad: studied his fathers curriculum, rewarded by being allowed to read the math books
 - Motivations:
	 - His family members were government tax collectors
	 - The calculations required were repetitive and tedious
	 - How can we do things better? Create a computational device
