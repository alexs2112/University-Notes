### Babbage (1791-1871)
 - Grandfather of the computer age, advanced ideas, speed of devices matched technology decades into the future
 - **Background**:
	 - Born into wealthy banking family, excelled at work, member of Royal Astronomical Society, founded Royal Statistical Society
	 - **Childhood**: Broke new toys by deconstructing them
	 - **Adulthood**: Tried to summon satan to confirm Christianity
		 - Went to boarding school, snuck out to check out math textbooks by candlelight
	 - **College**: Cambridge University, useless tutor to prepare him, deeper knowledge of math than his tutors
		 - Spent most time reading math papers, meeting with advanced students
		 - Translated, added substantially to calculus textbook by LaCroix, became the English standard
			 - Co-contributors: George Peacock, John Herschel
	 - **Recreation**: Active social life, chess club, ghost club, extractors club (proof of sane and insane), kept making social clubs
	 - **Post-College**: Failed at lectureship appointments, not enough recognition
		 - Eventually elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in Cambridge, still bitter at the school
	 - **Continental Europe**: Member of 15 European scientific societies, commander of Italian Orders of Saint Maurice + Saint Lazarus
		 - In Italy, wanted to study active volcano at Mount Vesuvius
	 - **Logarithms**: 1862, published most accurate set of logarithms. Wanted to reduce chances of misreading the information
		 - Experimented with typefaces, paper colours, ink colours
	 - **British Rail System**: Invented the cow catcher, sail above rail car to recover cars during windy days
	 - **Later Years**: Cantankerous attitude towards life, ran for political office to ban street performers
	 - **International Connections**: Disliked by common people, strong reputation in academic circles
		 - Travel to US to teach for a year, his ship sank before the trip, never planned to go to the US again
 - **Difference Engine**:
	 - Use the property of differences/difference tables to compute a series of numbers
	 - Mr E. Klipstein included first reference to such a device (1786). Publication including Captain JH Muller (described more ambitious computing device if more money was available), Muller credited w/ first publication
 - **Motivations**:
	 - Only foolproof method of preventing errors in mathematical tables was to remove people entirely from creating them
	 - Obsession with accuracy and completeness
	 - Idea in 1812 in Cambridge, face down in library thinking of it
	 - 1820s: Publishing table of logarithms, wanted to design machine to automate these tables
	 - 1822: First working model, 6 figure numbers, evaluate any function having constant second difference, 44 calculations/min
	 - Requested support from Royal Society, denied financial support from Lords of Treasure
		 - Government provided 1500 pounds, he used 3400 pounds to be reimbursed (handshake deal)
	 - Able to obtain services of Samuel Clement (very good at trades)
 - **Life During Design**:
	 - Babbage suffered from personal tragedies over 4 years: Death of wife, newborn baby daughter, father
		 - Resulted in health breakdowns and problems with the project, could not get reimbursed from gov't, renegotiating
	 - Appeals from his friends advanced another 1500 pounds, Duke of Wellington (Napoleon) advanced another 3k pounds with suggestion that Babbage shows evidence of his progress
 - **Babbage and Clement**:
	 - Babbage built a closer fireproof house to Clement's workshop, expecting him to join him. Clement refused, the two had a falling out. British law favoured Clement's position, he got the tools, machines, designs
	 - Work on Difference Engine was halted, Babbage conceived of new machine: The Analytical Engine
 - **End of Difference Engine**:
	 - Would be cheaper to build a new machine with different design, announcement not well received by government, lost majority position and had to start dealing with new group of officials
	 - Tired of process, asked Prime Minister to make a decision on the project, wasn't favourable to Babbage (1842)
	 - Eventually donated to a museum, British gov't financed the production of a Difference Engine in Sweden
	 - Cost: Government: 17k pounds, Babbage: 20k pounds
	 - Machine wasn't complete, overly-extensive description was very difficult to follow (eventually used by Dr Dionysus Lardner)
 - **Analytical Engine**:
	 - New concept: Computing machine controlled by external program
	 - Exact operation unknown, not completed, many iterations continuously produced until his death
	 - Recreated (1840 design) by Major-General HP Babbage (1906), son of Charles Babbage
	 - Components:
		 - Store: Memory, RAM
			 - Information stored in registers formed by gears, each gear to represent a single digit (10 positions)
		 - Mill: Performed calculations, ALU
			 - Complex arrangement of gears and linkages between them. 4 basic operations (+, -, * , /) with option of sqrt
		 - Control Barrel: Primitive micro-program control unit
			 - Similar to old-time music box, store microcode instructions
		 - Counter Mechanism: Loop control
	 - Significance:
		 - Babbage conceived of it as an academic exercise, didn't realize how useful it would be
		 - Much faster speed, more advanced technology (Addition in 3 seconds 1830, 1 second with later version 1871)
 - **Ada Augusta Countess of Lovelace**:
	 - Daughter of Lord Byron (bard) and Annabella Milbanke (trained mathematician), friends with Babbage

	 - Conceived of using the Analytical Engine for purposes other than just calculating numbers
		 - **First Programmer**
 - **Percy Ludgate (1883-1922)**:
	 - Designed, may have constructed his own version of Analytical Engine (1908)
		 - Unit control by paper tape or special keyboard
	 - Entirely mechanical, mechanisms by electric motor. Drawings and manuscripts lost forever

### Zuse Machines
 - Originally the V1 (Versuchsmodell-1/Experimental Model 1): After war changed to Z, avoid confusion with weapons by Wernher von Braun

	 - Came up with design of three parts: Control, Memory, Calculator
 - **Z1** (1938):
	 - Not familiar with other computers, started from scratch, approach to use binary system (0/1) instead of 10 state gears
	 - Memory: Solid strips of metal, slot cut into it, pit would rest on one side of the slot (either 0 or 1), metal plats would shift and move to allow memory to pass through different plates
		 - Worked well, complex routing of the ALU made transport of information problematic
	 - Development Lab (1936): Pre WWII, couldn't collaborate with others, built lab in his living room
	 - Overview: Input (decimal) -> Arithmetic (binary) -> Output (decimal)
	 - Data and instructions on 35mm film tape, low on resources so used random things

	 - Original destroyed by the allies in 1943-1944, copy made in 1960s to display in museum
	 - Relatively fast machine (~Harvard Mk I, 2 years later with larger budget), limited resources and isolation of Zuse
		 - Addition: 0.25-0.3 seconds
		 - Multiply: Two numbers every 4-5 seconds
	 - **Specifications**:
		 - Memory: 64x22 bit locations (64 words), wasn't practical for larger problems

	 - In 1950, only operational computer in Europe, one of the few in the entire world, continued to be used until 1960
 - Significance:
	 - First automatically controlled calculating machines that were actually functional
	 - Comparable speeds to machines developed later under poor working conditions (limited resources, funding, isolation)
