### The Principate
 - The Principate is the name given to the early Roman empire
 - Period is one of longstanding peace, economic prosperity, environmental stability. Empire was booming
 - Several imperial dynasties that emerge, including the Julio-Claudian, the Antonine, the Severan
 - Includes the two major pandemics: Antonine Plague (165-180) and the Plague of Cyprian (249-262)
 - Empire nearly collapses at the end of this period during the Crisis of the Third Century (234-284)

### Politics of the Principate
 - After civil wars, Augustus didn't re-establish the legal monarchy of the Republic in pursuit of political stability
 - Rather than an all-encompassing dynasty monarchy (Republic was created to avoid) Augustus instead consolidated various Republican positions into a single role: the princeps (first, first among equals)
 - Essentially created two branches of Roman government:
	 - Republican Branch: 600 senators and various magistrates (consuls, praetors, quaestors) would control the public treasury and senatorially-administered provinces
	 - Monarchic Branch: Princeps (emperor) based on limitless authority with its own officials (proconsuls, equestrians, praetorian guards) and control over imperial provinces+treasury

### The Pax Romana
 - Mediterranean world significantly under Roman influence/control
 - Augustus used propaganda to convince bellicose Romans that peace and trade were more profitable than war and looting
 - War didn't end, Italy experienced 200 years of peace, societies at the edge of the Roman world were constantly in conflict with provincials and Roman legions

### Imperial Rome
 - Augustus presided over a period of introducing many marble statues and inscriptions
 - During the principate that the most famous monuments and archaeological sites of Rome (and Italy) were originally built
**The Pantheon**:
 - Temple to all the gods, commissioned by Marcus Agrippa during reign of Augustus
	 - Burnt down in Great Fire of Rome in 64 CE, again in 110 CE
 - Current building rebuilt by emperor Hadrian, excavations show only the front facade retained
 - Don't know how the building was used when it was a temple
 - Dome is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world
 - One of the best preserved Roman buildings at it was continually in use, remains a church today
**Roman Victories**:
 - Triumphal monuments (columns and arches) were a phenomenon of Imperial Rome
	 - Celebration of military triumphs as an important part of imperial life
	 - Emperors used these monuments as permanent reminders of their greatness
 - Carvings on victory columns often depict details of battles or conquests
 - Neither have any structural purposes, both erected in very public locations
**The Flavian Ampitheater**:
 - Colosseum, most iconic monument of Imperial Rome, built by emperors Vespasian + Titus (72-80 CE)
 - Built on an artificial lake built by Nero after the Great Fire of Rome, much debris used to fill in the lake
 - Colosseum derived from a bronze colossus statue of Nero that stood near the site
 - Venu used to host munera (events, gladiatorial combats, executions, animal sacrifices, simulated sea battles), has been proven archaeologically and architecturally
 - Largest Roman amphitheater ever constructed, not the only one in Italy
	 - Sutri: Carved into soft tuff of bedrock
	 - Verona: Most complete in Italy, still used as an event venue today
	 - Pompeii: One of the oldest, not as grand as Rome or Verona, very well preserved

### Pompeii
 - Devestating earthquake in 62 CE, Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE
	 - Cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis, Stabiae were all destroyed
 - Cloud of tephra and gas erupted in height over 30km, ejected pumice and hot ash causing most of the building roofs to collapse
 - Eruption lasted two days. Eyewitness: Pliny the Younger, Pliny the Elder died when helping with evacuations
 - "Pompeii" likely refers to its earliest settlers being of the family Pompeia
 - Wealthy, if small, town for Roman Italy
 - Exact town location lost over medieval period, identified in 1590s by villagers digging a trench
 - First excavations occurred in 1748, site not confirmed as Pompeii until inscription found in 1763
	 - Guiseppe Fiorelli became director in 1860, began careful excavations (previously very haphazard)
	 - About 1/3 of the town site remains unexcavated
 - Largely a complete record of daily life preserved, snapshot int ime
 - Highlights of what we have learned:
	 - Roman construction and repair procedures, many buildings still being fixed from 62 earthquake
	 - Preservation of wall graffiti: Lots of people could read and write, most was quippy, political, lewd
	 - Preservation of wall paintings allow us to identify changes in artistic and decorative styles
	 - Certain artifacts (bread, scrolls, chariots) preserved in ways that inform us of the past in unbelievable detail
	 - Women had a much larger and more direct role in Roman social and political life than previously known
 - Role of Women at Pompeii:
	 - No official political roles in Rome, traditionally expected to manage households, serve husbands, give birth
	 - Archaeological reality: Freed women did this and much more, actively involved in economic, political, social life at Pompeii through the resources of their families
	 - Epigraphy on grave markers and tombs illustrate social statuses of women, painted portraits show wives were literate and equal to husbands in household matters
	 - Portrait of Terentius Neo, bakery owner, shows his wife is of equal status, educated, literate
 - The Eumachia Building:
	 - Pompeiian widow named Eumachia inherited family's wealth, used in acts of euergetism
	 - Became priestess of patron goddess Venus Pompeian (only political position for women) and was a patron for the guild of fullers (textile producers, dyers) of Pompeii
	 - Non-aristocratic woman who became deeply involved in public affairs, worked herself into high social standing
	 - Excavated building funded by her, bears her inscription and her son.
		 - Unclear what it was for, perhaps market or headquarters for fullers
		 - Most magnificent building in Pompeii, statuary honored Livia (Augustus' wife) and her sons)
 - Victims of Vesuvius:
	 - Estimated 20k people living around the slopes of Vesuvius during the eruption
	 - Remains of 2400 people found at Pompeii and Herculaneum, death toll as high as 16k
	 - Some victims died by crushing, others asphyxiated, others from extreme heat (400C in seconds)
		 - One individual had brain matter vitrified (turned to glass) due to extreme heat)
	 - Bodies entombed in pyroclastic materials (ash and mud), soft tissues decayed and disappeared, hardened soils kept their original shape
		 - Diggers would find voids, sought to fill them with plaster and excavate out the cast

### The Pagus and the Vicus
 - Despite catastrophe at Pompeii, Italian landscape continued to intensify and populations exploded over the first century CE
 - Apart from cities (urbs) and villas, one element of landscape was previously unmentioned: Pagus and vicus
	 - Poorly understood in Roman context, only know about them from epigraphy, ancient authors
 - Terms have their origins in pre-Roman organization of the landscape, adopted and modified over time
 - Pagus: Subdivision of a tribal territory, essentially a rural district
 - Vicus: Rural village situated within a pagus, vici could also refer to neighbourhoods in larger cities
	 - Augustus reorganized Rome into 14 regions and 265 vici

### Roman Imperial Economy
 - Imperial expansion of the empire under Caesar, Pompey, Augustus came at high economic cost
 - Integrating new lands: Aristocrats became more rich, Italy (especially Campania) became the playground of the wealthy
	 - Many villas around bay of Naples had only minimal productive zones (pars rustica), mostly involved in aquaculture
 - Size and complexity of Early Imperial Roman economy similar in scale to Europe in 1700
 - Italy became increasingly marginalized as exporter of wine, oil, wheat
	 - With fast growing urban population, Italy became an enormous importer of all kinds of goods very quickly between 50 BCE and 50 CE, take another century when this is felt in Italy

### Villas During the Principate
 - Continuing development of the Italian landscape, villas continue to multiply in number over the first, second century CE
 - More so than during late Republic, villas becoming vastly different in size and function
	 - Earlier villas primarily farms with few suburban example (rich country houses, small productive zones)
 - Increase in both leisure and productivity in villa structures until 100 CE
	 - After this, change in different places throughout northern, central, southern Italy
	 - Villas slowly (but increasingly) abandoned
		 - Some only abandoned for a century or two and then reoccupied
		 - Others (plainer villa rustica with smaller luxury spaces) and those that function off of slavery (Settefinestre) appear less likely to survive

### Settefinestre, Ager Cosanus
 - Second phase between era of Trajan and the Antonines (50-100)
	 - Decor of the pars urbana updated to fourth style wall painting
	 - Walls between atrium and largest triclinium was walled up
 - Pars rustica: Wine and olive presses removed and turned into grain storage, latrine replaced by animal pen, pigsty also added
	 - Large bath quarters built next to the main garden, new gardens were built
	 - New courtyard also built that appeared to house even more slaves
 - Late second century: Signs of decay, repairs were crude
	 - Access to new slave quarters were walled up (epidemic?)
	 - Bulding materials accumulated in corners of rooms
	 - Layer of dark earth covered the floors, evidence for hearths appear
