[general social state of the imperial period (compared to the Late Republic and Late Roman Empire), a question about well-preserved monuments in Rome, and a question about a famous woman associated with Pompeii]
[early imperial economy compared to the late republic, the annona, and two questions about common ceramic styles from the early empire (one from Italy, one from Greece).]
[Roman burial practices and evidence for early Christianity in Italy]
### The Principate
**Roman Italy**:
 - Early Roman Empire, longstanding peace, economic prosperity, environmental stability, empire was booming
 - **Politics**: Augustus didn't reestablish monarchy, consolidated various positions into a single role: The Princeps (1st among equals)
	 - Republican Branch: 600 senators, magistrates (consuls, praetors, quaestors) to control public treasury, senatorial provinces
	 - Monarchic Branch: Princeps (emperor) with limitless authority with its own officials (proconsuls, equestrians, praetorian guards) and control over imperial provinces and treasury
 - **Pax Romana**: Propaganda to convince Romans that peace and trade more profitable than war and looting, 200 years of peace
 - **Monuments of Imperial Rome**: Period of many marble statues and inscriptions
	 - **The Pantheon**: Temple to all the gods, burnt down in Great Fire of Rome in 64 CE, again in 110 CE. Dome is largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world, best preserved building as it was continually in use, remains a church today
	 - **Roman Victories**: Triumphal monuments (columns + arches) celebrate military triumphs as part of imperial life, emperors used as reminders of their greatness. Carvings on columns depict details of battles. Neither have structural purpose
	 - **Flavian Ampitheater**: The Colosseum, built on artificial lake by Nero after Great Fire (debris used to fill the lake). Colosseum derived from bronze colossus statue of Nero standing near the site. Largest Roman ampitheater constructed
		 - Hosted munera: events, gladiatorial combats, executions, animal sacrifices, simulated sea battles
 - **Pompeii**: Earthquake in 62 CE, Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE, tephra and gas cloud over 30 km high, eruption lasted 2 days
	 - Incredible preservation, snapshot in time, wall graffiti, wall painting, artifacts, construction and repair procedures
	 - Role of Women: No official roles in Rome, expected to manage households, serve husbands, give birth
		 - Reality: Also actively involved in economic, political, social life at Pompeii through the resources of their families
		 - Epigraphy on grave markers and tombs illustrate social status, portraits show literacy and equal in household manners
	 - Portrait of Terentius Neo: Bakery owner, shows that his wife is of equal status, educated, and literate
	 - **Eumachia Building**: Pompeiian widow named Eumachia inherited family wealth, used in acts of euergetism, deeply involved in public affairs, worked into high social standing
		 - Priestess of patron goddess Venus Pompeian, patron for the guide of fullers (textile producers, dyers)
		 - Excavated building funded by her (her inscription + son), unclear what it was for, most magnificient building in Pompeii
		 - Statuary honored Livia (Augustus' wife) and her sons
 - **Roman Imperial Economy**: Expansion of the empire under Caesar, Pompey, Augustus came at high economic cost
	 - Integrating new lands increased wealth of aristocrats, Italy (especially Campania) became the playground of the wealthy
	 - Size and complexity of Early Imperial Roman economy similar in scale to Europe in the 1700s
	 - Italy became increasingly marginalized as exporter of wine, oil, wheat
	 - Fast growing urban population, enormous importer of all kinds of goods between 50BCE-50CE, felt after another century
 - **Villas**: Continue to multiply in number, becoming vastly different in size and function, increase in both liesure and productivity
**Society and Economy**:
 - **Arretine Ware and Italian Sigillatas (IS)**: Arretine ware (red-gloss) quickly surpassed black-gloss in popularity
	 - 40 BCE: Started in Arretium (Arezzo), mould-formed, very fine relief, applique decorations with very diverse forms
	 - Reign of Tiberius: 14-37 CE, production of red-gloss outside Arretium and shipped everywhere
		 - Now called Italian (or Terra) Sigillata. Most common form at this time: Very flat footed plates
 - **African Red Slip Ware (ARS)**: Late 1st century CE, less refined, more orange than red, produced in Tunisia and Algeria
	 - Didn't need delicate firing of IS, huge quantities, variants continued to dominate western Rome until 5th-7th century
	 - Travelled as ballast to Italy, cost subsidized by state-funded grain ships, made pottery so cheap that everyone could afford it
	 - Example of Italy becoming a net importer of goods
 - **Eastern Sigillata**: Greek pottery style, originates in modern Turkey & Syria, red and black-surfaced, begins production in 150 BCE
	 - 10 BCE: Production shifts to produce mostly red-surface pottery to copy Roman Terra Sigillata
		 - Style continues through first century CE, gradually replaced by North African pottery
	 - 5 forms by production area, expert eye required to compare to IS, decisive factor is base of vessels (makers stamp in Greek)
 - **Age of the Antonines**: 100 CE, Italians lived well, prosperity by political stability and good economic markets
	 - Military stalling in Germania and against Parthians
	 - Antonine Plague: Life expectancy ~25 years (child mortality), spread through empire from eastern military campaigns
	 - End of golden age, after this there is crisis in military, economic, political stability. Possible spread of Christianity
 - **Death and Burial**: Complicated ritual funerary practices, celebration of life and accomplishment
	 - Cremation was the norm, richest Romans would get mausolea to house ashes, even the poorest were cremated
		 - Had to occur outside city walls, no human remains could be interred within the city
	 - Small tombs built on roadsides commissioned by families or guilds
	 - Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker: One of the largest freedman tomb monuments in Rome, looks like a big baking oven
	 - Pyramid Tomb of Cestius: Strange Roman politician, resembles Nubian pyramid
 - **Paleochristian Archaeology**: Christianity as new religion, know of early iconography (fish) in catacombs (rarely shrines)
	 - Romans tolerated other religions as long as they took place in public festivals and sacrificial rites
		 - Christians opposed sacrificial rites, led to periods of persecution in public places like the Colosseum
	 - Shrines used in periods of few worshippers or periods of prosecution
 - **The Catacombs**: Many early Christians and Jews cut series of catacombs, more desirable as it placed them alongside martyrs
	 - Many religious services conducted in underground catacombs until 6th century CE, then relocated to churches and basilicas
	 - Originally faced with bricks or marbles, then covered over in fresco paintings, valuable as main source of early Christian art
 - **Crisis of the Third Century**: Empire of Augustus collapses with assassination of last Severan by his own troops (235 CE)
	 - No smooth system of succession when the army realized it could use its power to choose emperors
	 - Plague of Cyprian: 249-262, death count was high, agriculture plummeted
	 - Mediterranean climate entered period of unpredictability, numerous famines, barbarians to attack Rome for food
	 - Founding of Constantinople transformative for Aegean, Emperor Aurelian reunited the empire, refortified Rome
	 - Emperor Diocletian (284-305) would impose sweeping reforms to save the empire, significant repercussions for Italy

[nature of the Greek landscape in the Middle Roman period, one question about slavery and Greece, and two questions about Roman villas in Greece (one is general, one is about Herodes Atticus).]
### Middle Roman Greece
 - **Landscape Reorganization**: Greece separated into 4 distinct provinces:
	 - Southern Greece: Province of Achaea, administrative capital at Corinth, Athens was cultural hub, included Cycladic islands
	 - Northwest Greece: Province of Epirus, capital at Nicopolis
	 - Northeast Greece: Province of Macedonia, capital at Thessaloniki
	 - Crete was administered along with coastal Libya as province of Crete and Cyrene, capital at Gortyn
 - **Middle Roman Landscape**: Period of recovery & economic growth, peasant farmlands not reoccupied, growth of villas & villages
	 - Only demographic impact pre-3rd century was the Antonine Plague (165-180), writings of physician Galen, first plague
	 - Old occupied regions of Greece see decline or stagnation, underdeveloped areas see expanding rural settlement
	 - Villas quickly dominate settlement hierarchy, not exactly like Italian, usually corridor-styles instead of atrium/peristyle forms
 - **Roman Villas in Greece**: Owned by two social classes: Settled Roman veterans/middle colonists, wealthy landowners (+ senators)
	 - Varying sizes of rural estates, access to major roads, close to water supplies, sometimes own cemeteries
	 - Variable agriculture potential in Greek soils, smaller farmsteads better suited for smaller patches of arable land
		 - Middle and lower classes declined, small plots disappear, larger ones in the hands of the rich
	 - With Rome: Villas appear in regions with largest and most fertile lands (several plains)
	 - Possible the landscape wasn't entirely controlled by villa elites, commuter-farming is archaeologically invisible
	 - 2nd Century: VIllas in Macedon see major wave of construction, new villas more modest in size w/ Roman features
	 - Greek villas use Italian-style decoration (b+w mosaic, opus spicatum floors) but built in Greek style corridor farmhouses
 - **Estate of Herodes Atticus**: Marcus Aurelius' rhetoric teacher, well known benefactor of Roman Greece, owned 3 Greek estates
	 - Suburban villa near Athens; Family estate at Marathon; Massive complex at Eua Loukou in Peloponnese
		 - Most interesting is Marathon, inherited and new constructions, mini-polis dedicated to his wife Regilla
		 - Eua Loukou is huge, gardens, apartments, towers. Imperial property after his death in 177 CE
	 - Perfect representations of the most luxurious rural villas in Greece during the Early and Middle Roman period
 - **Early Roman Cities**: New cities or newly favoured by Rome resulted in shift in urban populations (Hellenistic -> Roman)
	 - Decline in urban populations that isn't balanced by remaining cities, Romans likely enslaved large portion of Greeks
 - **Urbanization**: Few major centers emerge instead of hundreds of Classical city-states
	 - Romans refounded Corinth and Patras, new center at Nicopolis, favoured Hellenic cities like Thessaloniki, Gortyn
		 - These cities were instantly rich, Greeks sought to live in/near them
	 - Classical heritage for building inspiration, traditional cut stone methods for public buildings, didn't use Roman concrete
	 - Rebirth of Athens: sponsored by Emperor Hadrian, reoriented to focus on Roman Agora with library and University
	 - Roman Thessaloniki: Sided with Roman victors during early Republic, favoured regional center, rebuilt their town walls
	 - 2nd Century: Slwo introduction of concrete and brick, Roman games become popular, theaters set in hills w/ Roman styles
		 - Constructing aqueducts were significant improvements. Most spectacular: Hadrianic aqueduct of Corinth (100km long)
 - **Women in Roman Greece**: Elite women had more civic influence than Hellenistic period (Roman customs), new public offices
	 - Many statues & honorific inscriptions dedicated to elite women. New offices of gymnasiarchs and managing public revenue

[issues with understanding late antiquity archaeologically, three questions each about a piece of late antique artwork (one is a picture question), and one about the reforms of Diocletian.]
[six questions about the architecture of late antiquity, including spolia, the differences between imperial and late antique mosaics, reusing temples for Christian purposes, basilicas, roof tiles (look at alla cappucina burials), and town walls.]
[late antique landscape including Melania the Younger, abandoned lands in Italy, the economic boom of Greece, and I will show you a picture of a site and ask you to identify its location.]
### The Dominate
**Conceptualizing Late Antiquity**:
 - **Diocletianic Reforms**: Begins Late Antiquity, empire was too large and complex to function under the Augustan princeps model
	 - 239-305: Separated rule between 4 emperors (Tetrarchy) to better manage growing insecurity on provincial borders
		 - 2 senior augusti, 2 junior caesares, each would command a quarter of the empire. Reality: each augusti had one half
		 - Augusti had largest and richest lands, Caesares had most insecure borders needing constant military attention
		 - Barracks emperors: not hereditary aristocrats, origins and concentrations on war, military leaders
		 - Rulers command as monarchs from field bases until Tetrarchy destroyed from within by Constantinus
		 - Wanted to design system where emperors were chosen by ability instead of inherited, Constantine disagreed
	 - Divided the empire into dioceses that better reflected their defensive and economic potential
		 - New capitals at Trier, Milan, Sirmium, Nicomedia (no longer Rome, Italy as the center of the empire, still most people)
 - **Diocletian's Economic Reforms**: Italian landwoeners now need to pay taxes to the empire, affects how they manage estates
	 - Italy separated into 2 economic zones: Italia annonaria (annona agriculture), Italia suburbicaria (suburban rich landowners)
	 - Debasement of denarius was ruining economy by inflation, failed to establish a fixed price edict
	 - Incredibly important document, reconciles idealized economic conditions with real interpretations (amphora, coins, land)
 - **Constantinian Reunification**: After Diocletian retired, Constantine went to war with the Tetrarchy, sole ruler by 324
	 - Emperor Theodosius (379-395 CE) makes divide between east and west official, starts eastern and western Roman empire
 - **Late Antiquity Contradictions**: Major theme of Continuity vs Discontinuity
	 - Demolition of old monumental buildings; Civic culture decline; Military culture; Strong international economy + rural villas
	 - New simple constructions; Urban life centered on churches; Increasing insecurity; Social decline, weaker regional economy
 - **Constantine and the East**: Eastern empire owes development to Constantine due to 2 significant decisions
	 - New urban center in the east on Byzantium (New Rome, heart of empire moves east); Changed religion to Christianity
	 - Initiated new style of statuary portraying elites as larger than average citizens, exaggerated poses and facial features
	 - Example: Colossus of Constantine from Basilica Nova in Rome (12m tall marble statue)
		 - Rule was sanctioned by god, holy, no more first among equals
 - **Arch of Constantine**: Triumphal arch between Colosseum and Palatine Hill, largest ever built (21m tall), Constantine didn't return to see it until 326. Most interesting: Various origins of sculptural elements, perfectly represents world of Late Antiquity
 - **Age of Recycling**: Major theme is spoliation: destroying older structures to use their pieces (spolia) to create new ones
	 - Access to resources was limited due to crisis years
	 - Three forms: Buiding new structures with old parts; Renovating structures with new & old materials; Repurposing structures
**Restoring the Empire**:
 - 376: Emperors Valentinian II (West) and Valens (East) decreed no more new structures, must improve old ones instead
	 - Old monuments & buildings were in state of decay by neglect of Rome from Tetrarchy, Roman Forum underwent restoration
 - **Curia Senatus (The Senate House)**: Old senate house (Curia Julia) restored in Roman Forum, no longer internationally powerful, still involved in adminstrating Italy. In 630, converted into a church (Sant'Adriano al Foro)
 - **Late Antique Church**: Early worship: in house-churches, secretly in catacombs. Open worship: needed to happen indoors
 - **Christian Basilica**: Pagan temple worship meant to be outside temples, temples too small for Christian worshippers.
	 - Basilica repurposed as Christian church, many of the few buildings constructed were basilicas
 - **Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus**: Old St Peter's Basilica was demolished, monumental marble sarcophagus of Junius Bassus discovered. Senator in charge of Rome, converted to Christianity on deathbed. Most exquisite late antique Christian sarcophagus
 - **Death and Burial**: Most people buried in earthen graves or alla cappucina tombs, increasingly appeared in cemeteries around martyrial shrines. First time in Roman period, burials encroaching on civic spaces
 - **Outside the Capitals**: Early phase of long period of urban decay. Steep decline in private euergetism (no point if not a capital)
**Fifth Century CE**:
 - Barbarian raids by Goths, Vandals, Franks, Saxons. Wanted lands to farm and build homes, Rome didn't accept their warrior ethos
 - **Militarization of Towns**: Major investment in urban defenses, originally Rome, eventuallly every northern town
	 - Some buildings had to be destroyed/incorporated depending on route of new walls. Spolia makes it very difficult to date
	 - Not built out of panic, serious well-engineered defenses that took a long time. Spolia were economic necessity
 - **Late Antique Urbanism**: Churches emerge as central places in towns, adjacent buildings are used, outer ones fall into disrepair
	 - Roman domus, insulae, rural villas have rooms segmented by wood posts and makeshift walls for soldiers to live in the city
 - **Landscape**: Surviving maps (Tabula Peutingeriana) show active road network over late 4th century, disrepair by 5th (legislation)
 - **Melania the Younger**: 383-439 CE: Inherited massive wealth, donated all of it to ecclesiastical institutions around 408 CE
	 - No good archaeological evidence, copies of her donations survive, used to help grant her sainthood
	 - Owned vast properties of forests, agricultural fields, pastures. Largest estate had 60 large houses, each employed 400 slaves
 - **Loss of the Breadbaskets**: Largest economic loss was losing Africa to Vandals, depended on annona shipments to feed people
	 - 439 CE: Vandals took Carthage, grain shipments from Africa ceased, turned the annona fleet into a navy
	 - Romans tried buying grain from the Vandals, prices were exorbitant and delivery was spotty
	 - 455: Vandal king Geiseric sacked Rome. 460s: Also took Sicily, cutting off Rome's last secure grain supply
	 - Western empire shrank to the size of peninsular Italy with some territory over the Alps
 - **Empty Landscape**: Warfare was localized, mainly affected cities, Italians still needed food and tools
	 - Some abandonments, tax burden paused for extended periods (hard time collecting taxes)
	 - Only cities received ARS shipments to Italy from Africa, little made it to countryside, rural people began making coarsewares
	 - Late antique southern villas increase in size dramatically, rich fled to the east or their country estates with incredible luxury
 - Odoacer killed magister militum of last western emperor and deposed him (Romulus Augustulus, 12 yo) to gain power
	 - Sent imperial insignia to eastern emperor Zeno, allowed to rule Italy as Patrician (king) under Zeno
	 - End of the Western Roman Empire

### Late Roman Greece
**Landscapes of Late Antiquity**:
 - Economic stress, some urban & rural landscapes reached incredible levels of activity (full with Late Empire pottery sherds)
	 - Growth of large cities required countryside to produce considerably more food. Estates grow in number, food intensifies
 - **Example: Late Roman Boeotia**: New centers for commercial crop rotation with limited staff, invested in storage, fewer people
 - **Example: Late Roman Melos**: Sites for docking and exchanging cargo became highly developed, industrial mining other areas
 - **Greek Villas**: Few new villas, some grow in size & wealth. Most villas abandoned by end of 3rd century, wealthy surviving ones
**Economy**:
 - Eastern half experiences economic boom in 4th, 5th centuries. Western crisis changes Greece into heart of new Roman Empire
 - Creation of New Rome and increasing warfare requires more food, Greece intensifies agriculture, proliferation of villa estates
 - To facilitate movement of food, Eastern provinces shipped goods through Aegean, enormously prosperous for Greece
**Urban Transformation**:
 - **Cities**: Rural intensification increases, cities do not expand to earlier size. Decline in number, remainders are smaller than before
 - **Housing**: 5th Century: Many large urban houses had luxurious reception rooms for peers or clients (triclinia)
	 - Best example: Massive mansion in middle of old Athenian Agora, outside city walls, wealthy abandoning cities
 - **Changes to Urban Fabric**: Decline in city numbers countered by surge in monumental buildings; Agoras often filled with workshops, markets, burials; Bishops and clergy given more imperial authority to run public affairs; Churches very important
 - **The Rotunda**: Monumental domed temple to Zeus at the Palace of Galerius, Constantine would convert to a church
	 - Decline of civic culture marked by rarity of new public secular buildings/inscriptions/statues, now dedicated to Christianity
	 - Churches continue to be constructed or converted, mosaics remain advanced, Rotunda transformed and covered w/ mosaics
 - **Rise of the Kastra**: Fortified centers to house garrisons of militia and troops along with local admins, bishop, staff (castles)
	 - Curiales leave the cities and insecurity builds, many cities shrink and are reduced only to central kastra
	 - Forts come to represent small defended communities oriented around defense and Christian worship
 - **Death and Burial**: Continue to show massive wealth differentiation. Biggest change of intramural burial and Christian symbolism
	 - Upper class & ecclesiastic leaders: Marble sarcophagi; Middle classes: Vaulted chamber tombs; Others: Cist/Tile graves, pits
	 - Burial goods decline, Christian emphasis on spiritual vs materialistic afterlife. Pagan iconography reinterpreted as Christian
**Greek Pottery in the Late Empire**:
 - Pottery included less sophisticated red-gloss, with smooth surfaces instead of molded designs. Eastern Sigillatas replaces ARS
 - **African Red-Slip Ware (ARS)**: All over the Mediterranean, C and D varieties common post 200 CE (flatter, broader dishes)
	 - Shift in ARS designs over late antiquity (flatness, applique, stamps, Christian iconography) seen in surviving metal vessels
 - **Phocean Red Slip**: Italy dominated by African pottery in late antiquity, Greece shows more variety
	 - Produced on west coast of Turkey, high numbers in 350-550, reduced until it disappears around 650 CE
	 - Growth directly influenced by Constantinople, after 420 takes shape of tall deep bowls with pronounced overhanging rim
 - **Late Roman Amphoras (LRA)**: Typologies more ambiguous due to many production locations and types
	 - Made all over the Aegean, LRA 2 forms especially widespread (extremely round, nib on bottom)
	 - Amphoras end production in 7th-8th centuries, oil & wine production lessen but did not stop (likely used wooden barrels)

[conceptualizing late antiquity, Odoacer’s Italy, the late antique little ice age, and the Justinianic plague]
[one famous late antique mosaic and a general question about the Byzantine-Gothic war]
[Bonus Question from the End of Antiquity (13.2)]
### Post-Roman Italy - End of Antiquity
 - **Continuity and Discontinuity**: Core debate between archaeologists and historians: Timing of the end of Roman influence
	 - Historians - Continuists: Rhetoric of ancient sources (end of world) appear overstated compared to non-religious economic + political sources. For most, the ancient world didn't end, it just transformed into the middle ages (Survival of Christianity)
	 - Archaeologists - Catastrophists: Identify discontinuities. Wide availability of ARS ends, Villas disappear
 - **Odoacer's Roman Empire**: Archaeology of Odoacer's Italy is indistinguishable from earlier 5th century
	 - Empire contracted into a form more manageable with resources and wealth of the period, Europe fragments
	 - Roman senate and villa agriculture continued
**Ostrogothic Italy**:
 - Eastern emperor Zeno disliked how Odoacer ruled Italy, paid Ostrogoths to invade Italy, Odoacer surrendered and was executed
 - Ostrogoths had no intention of being Roman puppets, Theoderic the Great created new kingdom of Italy, very Romanized
	 - Descendents were less successful. Daughter Amalasuintha killed trying to broker peace, Emperor Justinian retook the west
	 - No distinctive Ostrogothic material culture (Romanized), two archaeological indicators: Fortresses, changes to urban fabric
	 - Theoderic the Great familiar with Roman forms of gov't, used Roman methods to appease the people, collected land tax
		 - Rest of the west was fully medieval, no more land tax, start of vassalage and serfdom
	 - Romanness of Ostrogoths is visible in architecture of major cities
 - **Castelli**: Occupied/Established new fortified centers at major passes through the Alps
	 - Kinds: Fortification walls around agricultural settlements; Clear military fortifications w/ natural defenses; Small castles
 - **Verona and Brescia**: Ostrogothic soldiers living in older middle/upper class domus, wooden partitions with pottery & coins (pay)
	 - Evidence for significant refortification, walls difficult to date, proxy evidence of updated defenses during occupation
 - **Basilica of San Vitale**: Ostrogoths were Arian Christians, this basilica represents height of late Roman religious construction
	 - Perfect blend of eastern and western architecture at the very end of the Roman period
	 - Best preserved golden mosaics outside Istanbul
**536 CE: Worst Year in Human History**:
 - **Byzantine-Gothic War (535-554)**: Not war of numerous pitched battles, late antiquity tactics promote siege warfare
	 - 535 CE: General Belisarius lands in Italy after defeating Persians and North Africa for Justinian
	 - 540 CE: Retaken Naples, Rome, Ravenna, Milan for the Romans, the Empire was reforming
	 - Belisarius recalled by Justinian, war of attrition, new Ostrogothic King Totila clawed back nearly whole peninsula
	 - Justinian sent new general Narses to regain peninsula, by 553 Totila was dead, most Ostrogoth strongholds surrendered
 - **Late Antique Little Ice Age (536-551)**: Cassidorus calls it a dry fog, dimming the sun for 18 months. Crops withered and died
	 - Dendrochronological studies in the Alps, North Europe shows slowest tree growth over last 6000 years
		 - Alpine Glaciers: 5 out of 20 of the coldest decades over the entire Holocene occurred between 500-600
	 - Theory: Volcanic events created dust veil that engulfed the entire planet
		 - Period of intense famine and disease. Christian writers described as the end of the world
 - **The Justiniac Plague (541-750)**: First noted in Egyot in 541, by 543 the illness is described in Italy and Greece
	 - Bubonic Yersina Pestis, the Black Death. 1/3-1/2 of Europe killed. Travelled from black rats to humans via flea bites
	 - Mostly disease of the cities (interconnected trade), spread nearly everywhere, continued to flare in Constantinople until 750s
	 - Justinian attempted to dispose of corpses by digging mass graves outside Constantinople, none have been found
		 - Graves of 3-4 victims all over Europe suggest increase in mortality in mid 6th century
	 - Procopius: Mentioned urban defenses all over eastern empire were being used as morgues
	 - John of Caesarea: Dead cross hatched in layers, victims trampled by feet, winepress of the fury of the wrath of god
**End of the Roman Landscape in Italy**:
 - Invasion of eastern Romans set off chain reaction devastating Italian people and landscape
	 - Both Byzantines and Ostrogoths decimated all agricultural land to feed soldiers, insecurity made travel treacherous
 - Villa system broke down completely, last villas all abandoned. Richest Italians fled to Constantinople and southern Aegean
 - Only Roman institution that survived the war: The church, Bishops became de facto city leaders
 - **The Lombards**: After defeating Ostrogoths, Justinian issued Pragmatic Sanction in 554. High taxes on Italians, stymied any chance for economic or social regeneration
	 - 568: Germanic Lombards entered Italy, quickly established in major cities, took all imperial lands making them rich
	 - Weakened Italians stood no chance, Lombards conquered whole peninsula, ending Roman government and economy
	 - Landscape highly regionalized, authority from kings and dukes through gifts of land and payment in labour
	 - Start of medieval Italy
 - **Greece**: Urban decline, large-scale landscape abandonment, raids by Huns and Slavs reached critical levels and took Greece
 - **Medieval Future**: East survived in transformed state until Muslim advances destroyed wealth, west buckled under 6th century
	 - Emperors Heraclius and Constans II shrunk the eastern empire to withstand losses
	 - Decomplexified, reduced aristocratic bureaucracy, imposed military control (thema)
	 - Made eastern empire medieval: Emperor controlled the army directly and the army controlled the land
	 - World of decentralized and small militarized polities, democracy was gone, rural people subjugated + pressed into serfdom
