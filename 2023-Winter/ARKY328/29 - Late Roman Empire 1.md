# Conceptualizing Late Antiquity
### Overview
 - Begins with the reforms of Diocletian, huge changes to imperial organization for Italy
 - Constantine's reforms include the adoption of Christianity
 - Sometimes called the Age of Recycling and spoliation
 - Foundation of Constantinople had significant effects on the landscape of Roman Greece, overall unique compared to what happens in the Western Empire

### Diocletianic Reforms
 - Empire was too large+complex to function under the Augustan princeps model
 - 293: Instituted series of reforms that would give the empire another two centuries of life
 - Separated rule between four emperors (two senior augusti, two junior caesares) to better manage growing insecurity on provincial borders, give locals a more direct connection to their imperial leader
	 - Power sharing system known as the Tetrarchy
	 - Officially divided the empire from 293-305
 - Each emperor would command a quarter of the empire
	 - In reality: Senior augusti each had major contorl over one half of the empire (east and west)
	 - Junior caesares would one day replace them
	 - Augusti had largest + richest lands, caesares had most insecure borders that need constant military attention
 - Most late Roman emperors were not hereditary aristocrats, military leaders
	 - "Barracks emperors", reflecting their origins and concentrations on war
 - Also divided the empire into dioceses that better reflected their defensive and economic potential
 - New imperial capitals were established at Trier, Milan, Sirmium, Nicomedia
	 - Rome no longer the capital of the Roman Empire (Italy no longer the center of the empire)
	 - Rome still had the largest population and its senate still operated (but weak to power of the Tetrarchy)
 - This period (Dominate) saw rulers command as monarchs from field bases
	 - This continues until the Tetrarchy is destroyed from within by the son of one of the caesares (Constantinus)
 - Diocletian acknowledged inherited rule was unstable, wanted to design system where emperors chosen off ability
	 - Constantine disagreed, by 312 Constantine reestablished sole rule over the united empire

### Diocletian's Economic Reforms
 - Italy was no longer a privileged center, for the first time Italian landowners would need to pay taxes to the empire
	 - Would affect how landowners chose to manage their estates
 - Italy was separated into two economic zones: (tells us where certain types of land use were concentrated)
	 - Italia annonaria: Lands from where Annona provisions were extracted
	 - Italia suburbicaria: Suburban lands of rich landowners
 - Diocletian knew debasement of the denarius was devastating commerce through inflation
	 - Sought to establish a fixed price edict, which would ultimately fail
	 - Incredibly important document, helps archaeologists reconcile idealized economic conditions with what is interpreted from amphora movement, coins, intensity of land use

### Constantinian Reunification
 - Constantine believed it was his right to inherit the position of his father
 - After Diocletian retired to his massive palace, Constantine went to war with the Tetrarchy
	 - By 324, he was the sole ruler of a reunited empire
 - Still cultural and administrative divide between east and west
	 - Wouldnt be made official until emperor Theodosius (379-395 CE)
	 - Sources start describing an eastern and western Roman empire

### Contradictions of Late Antiquity
 - Tied of with a major theme of the end of the late antiquity: Continuity and discontinuity
 - Demolitions of old monumental buildings alongside new wooden/simple constructions
 - Decline of civic culture, boom in urban life centered on churches
 - Pervasive military culture, increasing insecurity
 - Strong international economy and continuation of rural villa culture, social decline and weaker regional economy

### Constantine and the East
 - Eastern half of the empire owes its development to Constantine, two significant decisions:
	 - New urban center in the east on the foundations of a town called Byzantium
		 - This New Rome was better positioned than Old Rome to take advantage of eastern wealth + resources
		 - Heart of the empire would move east, Aegean funnels unparalleled amounts of commerce by Hellespont
	 - Changed the state religion of the empire to Christianity, unfathomable repercussions
		 - Changed physical and mental world, gave communities a new framework to unite while fending off the overwhelming military threats
 - Also initiated a new style of statuary
	 - Statuary from the Principate: Depicted emperors through Hellenistic and Classical realism
	 - Late Roman art: Portrayed elite as larger than average citizens, exaggerated poses and facial features
	 - Best example: Colossus of Constantine from Basilica Nova in Rome (12m tall marble statue)
		 - Rule was sanctioned by god, therefore holy. No more first among equals

### Christian Empire
 - Diocletian oversaw last mass Christian persecution to attempt to remove it from the empire
 - Constantine took the opposite approach knowing history of unsuccessful persecutions
	 - Before battline last imperial rival (Maxentius) at Milvian Bridge in Rome, saw symbol in the sky
	 - Ordered soldiers to paint it on their shields, the Chi Rho, Greek symbol for Jesus Christ
 - Successive emperors continued to Christianise, positions elevated through "special relationship" with God
	 - New source of legitimacy, power issued by God and divine right
	 - Made clear in material culture, coin and monuments

### Arch of Constantine
 - Roman senate commissioned a triumphal arch to celebrate Constantines victory at the Milvian bridge (312 CE)
 - Built over 312-315 CE, situated between Colosseum and Palatine hill
	 - Ancient route of Roman triumphs called the via triumphalis
	 - Eventually used as part of a fortress in the middle ages, partially restored in 1700s
 - Largest ever built, 21m (69 feet) tall, Constantine didn't return to Rome to see his monument until 326 CE
 - Most interesting part: Various origins of sculptural elements, perfectly represents world of Late Antiquity

### Age of Recycling
 - Major theme of late antique material culture is spoliation (destroying/disassembling) older structures/monuments and using their pieces (spolia) to create new ones
 - Confusion of crisis years deteriorated supply systems of the empire, access to resources was limited
 - Three main forms:
	 - Structures built anew with pieces from various other demolished structures
	 - Structures renovated with some new (usually brick) and old materials
	 - Structures repurposed for new uses that might not require older elements or decorations

### Landscapes of Late Antiquity: Greece
 - Economic stress, some urban and rural landscapes manage to reach incredible levels of activity
	 - Areas of low settlement in early/middle Imperial period are filled with Late Empire pottery sherds
 - Growth of cities like Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch required countryside to produce considerably more food
 - Most common artifact on surveys are amphora sherds
 - Estates growing in number, food production intensifying, not clear if more people were actually living rurally
 - **Example: Late Roman Boeotia**:
	 - New estate centers built for commercial crop rotation with limted staff (wage labourers from nearby towns)
	 - Did not spend wealth to update to lavish villas, instead invested in storage structures and transport vessels
	 - Likely fewer people living rurally, those remained engaged in intensive commercial crop production for trade
		 - Intensively farmed so the richest landowners could make more profit
 - **Example: Late Roman Melos**:
	 - Site suitable for docking and exchange of cargoes become highly developed. Best example: Island of Melos
	 - Industrial scale mining operations along with numerous small bays and ports
	 - Entrepreneurial Late Roman aristocrats exploted every aspect of this rocky landscape

### Economic Boom of Late Roman Greece
 - Eastern half experiences economic boom in 4th, 5th centuries
	 - Western half is not as lucky, official division occurs under Theodosius in 395
 - Crisis of the western empire changes Greece (Roman backwater) into the heart of a new eastern Empire focused on Constantinople
 - Creation of New Rome and increasing warfare along Danube required great amounts of food
	 - Greece required to intensify grain, oil, wine production
	 - Led to proliferation of villa estates in the countryside focused on commercial food production
 - To facilitate the movement of this food, all Eastern Roman provinces shipped goods through the Aegean
	 - Enormously prosperous economic situation
	 - Exports from the Aegean would move north, but also west. Eastern pottery found in Italy, south France, Spain, Britain
