### Overview
 - Lagged behind the Aegean in terms of material culture, social sophistication
 - Wildly different social histories with unique cultural names, many societies are broadly similar, peninsula has striking cultural uniformity

### General Chronology
 - Interpreted on the basis of pottery synchronisms with Aegean imports (mostly Mycenaean)
	 - Recently, radiocarbon ddates

### Italian Bronze
 - Almost exclusively in the form of flanged axe heads, daggers
 - Bronze is widely inconsistent in terms of arsenic and tin levels
 - Most Bronze Age Italian sites are devoid of any metal, appear more like Neolithic sites with wood, bone, stone tools
 - Bronze becomes common in Italy, consistently molded with tin, only during the Recent and Final Bronze Age in the last half of the second millenium BCE

### Early Bronze Age Italy
 - Bell Beaker material culture merged with Remedello, Rinaldone Chalcolithic cultures of the Po Plain & Tuscany, to create the first true Bronze Age Italian regional culture
	 - Called Polada
 - Not a huge distinctive genetic migration of people
	 - diffusion of technological and stylistic attributes
	 - Some people migrated, small numbers, greater phase possibly in later Beaker phase
 - Bell Beaker culture is known for their expert use of bronze and gold, advancement in archery technology with ne arrowhead styles in stone and metal
 - Bell Beaker people did not have a common burial culture
	 - Some interred their dead and built tumuli, some cremated their dead and placed remains in urns

### Bell Beaker People
 - Distinctive cord-impressed drinking cups
 - Not all cups were for drinking, some for status simples, some for copper reduction pots, some for food, some for funerary urns
 - Not all cups were cord-impressed, some decorated with patterned impressions (All Over Ornamented, AOO), still distinctive Beaker body shape

### Polada Culture
 - Appears distinct from the Beakers, clearly rooted in that tradition
 - Known for building their houses on wooden stilts above peat bogs, similar to Neolithic ancestors
 - Purpose was to alleviate the threat of flooding on the river flood plain
 - As these settlements were abandoned and decayed, their material culture fell into the water below
 - If these sediments were stuck in capped flood material (mud), anaerobic environment preserved muh of the organic material culture from decay
	 - Great preservation

### Middle Bronze Age Terramare
 - Nutrient rich sediment (terra marna) quarried for fertilizer
	 - Taken from small hills all over Po Plain
	 - Discovered these hills were ancient sites
	 - Nutritious soil was formed from villages of wooden structures, small gardens decaying over millenia into the rich Po valley alluvial plain
 - First scientific excavations by Pellegrino Strobel, Luigi Pigorini in 1860s
 - Villages described as pile-dwelling villages, just like the Polada
	 - Built on wooden piles sunk into the moist Po alluvial settlements
 - Area mostly vacant before 1700 BCE, cooler and humid Lobben climatic oscillation incentivised groups from all around to settle here
 - By 1550-1450 BCE (MBA 2) the settlements are consistent:
	 - About 2 ha
	 - Built on small lakes formed by the Po river
	 - Roughly square, houses on orthogonal pattern
	 - Include a perimeter moat or embankment
 - Terramere peoples were also prolific traders, possible they were the first group to bring the entire Italian peninsula into a single economic sphere by the RBA
 - Around 1450-1350 BCE (MBA 3), territory is reorganized, possibly due to new political order
	 - Some sites are abandoned, others grow considerably (15-20 ha)
	 - Some smaller sites around the main villages appear to be subordinate, ridumentary settlement hierarchy is forming
	 - Infrastructure becomes far more complex:
		 - Embankments, roads were improved
		 - Networks of canals were dug to irrigate cultivated fields around the villages

### Middle Bronze Age Wine Consumption
 - Recent study (2020) of tartaric acid residue on ceramic sherds, along with excavated examples of Vitis Vinifera wood, pips, pollen from two Terramare sites suggest that wine (maybe vinegar) was being consumed from at least 15th-14th centure BCE (MBA 2 - RBA)
 - Earliest evidence for wine consumption in northern Italy
	 - Some of these ceramic vessels may have been coated inside with resin, flavour and preserve the wine
 - Well-supported Theory: Wine came to Italy with Mycenaean social and economic connections, region influenced by trade with central Europe and also the Aegean
 - Predates evidence for Sardinian wine consumption, influenced by the Phoenicians, by at least a century

### Middle Bronze Age Terramare Burial
 - Necropolis of Casinalbo, most famous
 - Two stages:
	 - Incinerating the deceased on funeral pyre
	 - Collection of remaining bone fragments and surviving personal items (from RBA) into cinerary urns, buried in cemeteries

### End of Terramare (1150 BCE)
 - Appear to decline in 1250 BCE< collapse 1150 BCE (late RBA)
 - Current theory is their huge population (200k) could not withstand period of aridity noted in archaeobotanical record
	 - Lowered aquifers, dried out agricultural fields
 - Based on communal living
	 - Elites are present, heavily integrated and barely visible archaeologically
	 - Everything appeared shared, massive earthworks needed constant community effort to maintain
 - When the fields dried up and food was scarce, Terramare people had no reason to continue investing in these public works
	 - Communities fissioned and people moved to areas of better agricultural potential

### Bronze Age Sardinia
 - Home to Nuragic culture, much more technologically advanced and socially complex than anything on the contemporary mainland
 - Nuragic culture developed autochthonously (indigenously) in Sardinia out of the Beaker, Bonnanaro culture in the early Bronze Age
	 - Last group had similar material culture to the contemporary Polada culture on the mainland
 - At the same time, Corsicans were developing a megalithic construction style from connections with the Iberian peninsula, other western Mediterranean islands
 - Late Bronze Age, these factors combined to create proto-Nuragic culture

### Protonuraghi
 - Late, sub-Bonnanaro periods (1700-1500 BCE) the first protonuraghi
	 - Corridor Nuraghi
	 - Megalithic structures as tall as 10m
 - Terraces built on top of these protonuraghi likely supported wooden houses, livestock and food likely kept in the stone structure below

### The Nuragic Culture of Sardinia
 - Sardinia is famous for its Bronze Age landscape of stone towers called nuraghi
	 - Might be an actual bronze age word for these structures, not Indo-European
 - Nuraghi were defensive towers built in a truncated cone shape
	 - Similar to beehive tholoi of the Mycenaeans
	 - Built in a dressed dry-stone style (no mortar)
 - Over 7000 nuraghi (1600-900 BE) dot the Sardinian landscape
 - By Early Middle Bronze Age (1600 BCE), classic nuraghi, with a circular interior room and false beehive dome, were appearing all over the island
	 - At this time, Sardinia was a vast forest, Nuraghi didn't stand out so much
 - During the late (1350-1150 BCE) and final Bronze Ages (1150-950 BCE), nuraghi develop into large complexes of stone towers with curtain walls
	 - New feature was the construction of sacred springs, subterranean nuraghe temples, creating vaulted champers over naturally ocurring springs
		 - Sacredness of water
 - Burials consist of communal tombs, giants tombs, large gallery graves. Two types:
	 - More ancient is the slab type, upright slabs forming a semi-cercle with a central stele in the middle along with a cut doorway, slabs all over the gallery
		 - Rows of tombs beyond the doorway, had to crawl through the very small doorway
	 - Later version is similar, more block-cut type similar to western European megaliths
 - After 900, nuraghi are no longer built or being used
	 - Those that continued take on a new cermonial function
	 - Open-air, unfortified villages built at this time, some reusing stone from fallen nuraghi
		 - Houses built in subrectangular plan
	 - Bronze Age houses were round and undifferentiated, new Iron Age structures had differentiated spaces among several rooms
 - Early bronze age corridor nuraghi and their associated burial style of "giants tombs" were communal, society was a little more egalitarian
 - By the final Bronze Age, settlement structure, burial culture moved from communal to structured hierarchical societies
	 - Open-air villages had clear leaders, nuraghi complexes did not
	 - Burial also becomes more individual, not communal
	 - Perhaps due to influence of earlier trade contacts with the eastern Mediterranean in the Recent Bronze Age
	 - LH II-III Mycenaean pottery has been found all over Sardinia and southern mainland Italy

### Apennine Culture
 - Another group from Bell Beaker culture more sporadic throughout the rest of the Italian peninsula
 - Burnished pottery with incised dotted or ladderd bands, originallyy dated by its association with better-known Mycenaean pottery
 - In MBA, appear to be semi-nomadic transhumant herders
	 - In winter they lived in small defensible hamlets in the interior
	 - In summer they moved with their herds to coastal plains, lived in temporary settlements, caves, rock shelters (Capitoline Hill in Rome)
 - In RBA, sites appear to shift from semi-nomadic societies to agricultural settlements focused on stock raising
	 - Abandonment of coastal areas in favour of interior, defensible locations
	 - Pottery loses its decoration, becomes plain burnished ware
	 - Cremation burial also replaces cist or simple pit inhumations
	 - All occurs around the same time as the Terramare culture begins to decline

### Luni sul Mignone
 - Northwestern Italian Coast had remarkable evidence for Apennine culture, shows not all were nomadic
 - Apennine and Mycenaean pottery found together in the same buried contexts, allowing for local pottery styles to be synchronously dated
 - Three house structures dug into the soft Etrurian tuff, likely had thatched roofs
 - Excavations demonstrated presence of portable hearths, hand mills for grinding grain and pulses, bones of sheep, goats, pigs, cattle
	 - Permanently settled people, not nomads
	 - Mixed economy based on agriculture, animal husbandry, transhumance
 - Abandoned by the Etruscans, reoccupied in late antiquity/middle ages by a Christian church
