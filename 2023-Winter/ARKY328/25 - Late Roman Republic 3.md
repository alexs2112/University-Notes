# Farming and Economy
### Texts about Roman Farming: Agronomists
 - Socially: Farming seen as hallmark of an idealized life
	 - Profitable, delightful, freeing from the obligations of the city
 - Four authors wrote manuals specifically outlining how to farm, the Roman agronomists
 - Cato the Elder: De agri culture (on agriculture), farmers handbook on vineyards and use of slaves in wine production
 - Varro: Rerum rusticarum libri III (Agricultural topics in three books), specifically about efficient organization of rural estates, superficially through slaves
 - Columella: De re rustica (on rural affairs), book on rural lifeways, including information on many different things
 - Palladius: Opus agriculturae (agricultural work), late Roman farming, particularly popular among learned  medieval estate owners. Also water mill for grinding grain

### Republican Farming
 - Scholars make a distinction between lowland arable agriculturalists and mountainous pastoralists
	 - Roman Italy instead had a very diverse rural economy, cereals and legumes alongside animals
 - Pliny: Emmer was earliest cultivated cereal in Rome, only switched to wheat and barley after a series of famines forced them to buy from Etruscans and Greeks (un-Roman grains leading to tension)
	 - Archaeobotanical evidence shows barley and wheat were cultivated 200 years before this event
 - Cato: Farm estates could be two general sizes: fundus (small/individual) and ager (larger estate)
 - Romans used many farming implements, ox-driven ards (scratch ploughs) to turn the ground

### Case Study: Metapontum
 - Sources: Greek colonies of southern Italy associated with cultivating barley
	 - Unquestioned as barley has higher tolerance to drought, thrives in soils of the south
	 - Wheat was considered a luxury
 - Excavations in the chora of Metapontum shows a diverse economy, many different crops
 - Wheat monocropping appears in late 4th century, risky
	 - May be due to decline of chora and asty after 300 BCE

### Grapes and Olives
 - Monocropping was risky, high incidence of coltura promiscua (interropping) by the Late Republic
 - Grapes introduced to Italy naturally, olives transplanted by people
 - Direct evidence: Grape seeds and olive pits abundant in Late Republic contexts
 - Indirect evidence: Grape and olive pollen from regional sediment cores, architectural contexts, production and distribution of wine and oil containers (amphora)

### Late Republic Villa
 - Some villas during the late Republic expanded in size and grandeur, Aristocrats relying on them more to convey and consolidate economic and territorial authority locally.
 - Villas frequent in Roman sources
	 - Agronomists discuss them at length
 - Roman aristocrats would speak of two apposing aspects of rural life:
	 - Negotium: Duty of urban, political, economic life
	 - Otium: Pursuit of leisure, relaxation, contemplation, and country living (aka, Villas)
 - Early studies of villas were limited to extremely large or opulent ones, "otium villas", limited production
 - After Pompeii: Villa's frequently looted by people for art and wall paintings, smaller villas were ignored
 - Villa studies became popular after WWII, enormous number of new sites were identified

### Modern Villa Studies
 - Researchers seek to:
	 - Understand the origins of villa sites
	 - Interpret villas in their cultural contexts, places connected to memory and identity
	 - Study how elite owners used villas as platforms to recreate ideologies and politics in terms of agrarian life
	 - Consider villas from view of social history, how centers of production and nodes in the settlement network helped create and maintain identity + status for its owner
	 - Understand the lives of the workforce, how their tenancy was organized
	 - Whether or not the term "villa" is even useful

### Villa Typologies
 - Country residence, opposite of the urban domus
 - Two main forms:
	 - Villa Urbana: Refined and comfortable complex (domus in the countryside), sea version as a villa maritima
	 - Villa Rustica: More humble, large scale farming center
 - Further divisions:
	 - Villas had a pars rustica (rural dwelling),
	 - pars urbana (urban dwelling),
	 - pars fructuaria (storage vats, wine and oil presses, granaries, threshing floors, etc)
 - These typologies are hard to reconcile archaeologically, vast majority of known villa sites engaged in productive activities. One exception is Settefinestre

### Settefinestre, Ager Cosanus
 - Most important late Republican Italian villa near Cosa in south Tuscany
 - Interpreted as villa schiavistica (slave run villa), Varro suggests is the most economical
 - Excavators identified a pars urbana and pars rustica surrounded by portico with large walled garden
	 - Pars rustica had evience for small wash basin, well, donkey stable, wine+olive press, latrine
	 - Large semi-subterranean structure (cryptoporticus) included a huge wine fermentation vat (lacas vinarium)
	 - Under the atrium, two cisters to collect rainwater from impluvium and terracotta drains
 - Service courtyard south of main villa structure, included a kitchen, stables, cella
	 - Slave quarters for about 45 individuals\\

### Amphora
 - Ceramic containers designed to ship and store food products made in the villa dominated landscape
	 - Means by which agricultural surplus was shipped and distributed
 - Heavy and difficult to move, not designed to be seet up in houses and used every day
	 - Simply moved (by boat or barge) their contents from production to distribution
	 - Commonly emptied at first stop and contents divided into smaller vessels
 - Manufactured everywhere in the Mediterranean
 - Marker artifacts, carry meanings. Refer to economic life, food production, exchange relationships, sizes of markets
	 - Remarkably talkative tracers of economic history
	 - Can estimate contents by identifying te resin in the interior (if resin then wine || garum; else oil)
	 - Stamps into the vessel before firing can provide info on who produced the vessel
	 - Rare painted inscriptions that describe nature and quality of contents, quantity, production place, producer name
 - Most analysis work started by Heinrich Dressel in late 1800s, much more popular from 1950s with deep sea diving
 - Dressel Classification (1899):
	 - Several modifications made to the scheme to further subdivide the amphorae into distinct classes
	 - Most classifications up to the 1980s relied on the morphology of the vessels
	 - Recently: Studies increasingly turned to petrological analysis of ceramic fabrics to help determine where certain styles originated
	 - Commonly based on class (morphology) and type (origin, ie Campanian or Catalan)
 - Real Roman amphoras enter production around 350 BCE copying Greek designs
 - **Economy**:
	 - Roman sources speak highly of the wine produced on western coast of Italy, also mention Adriatic and Puglian wine
	 - Know wine production overseen by large villa owners, relied on slave labour
	 - Production occurred in Italy, products like wine, oil, garum, shipped all over the western Mediterranean.
		 - Know this from amphora sherds in France, Spain, NA, shipwrecks
	 - Amphoras don't necessarily tell us much about production, invaluable to shipment
 - **Production**:
	 - Excavations at Albinia in Tuscany
		 - Multiple producers identified, don't know who owned this production site
	 - Kilns: Show they were fired upside down, packed into the furnace. 3900 fired per kiln per year
		 - Shipwrecks containing thousands of amphoras each makes this number reasonable
	 - Amphora Stamps: Produced and filled by slaves, some contained wine, others garum. 
		 - Wine production isn't significant in Etruria during late Republic
		 - Likely wine here was mass produced for export, wine in Campania for local consumption
	 - Studies also suggest different vessels manufactured for different products

### Shipwrecks and the Roman Economy
 - Shipwrecks only represent a small minority of shipping evidence. From 3rd-1st centuries BCE the numbers of wrecks in Tyrrhenian Italy increase 3-4 times
	 - Huge explosion of trade in the late Republic
 - Madrague de Giens shipwreck: Spectacular, wine in three layers of amphoras laid out, amphoras sealed with cork lids lined with pozzolana (volcanic ash-based cement)
	 - Bottom layer had branches of heather, juniper, rushes packed between amphoras to cushion them
	 - Upper layers packed with secondary cargo
	 - Carrying second-rate red wine to Gaul, Italians themselves drinking first rate white wine (Latium, Campania)

### End of the Republic
 - Political instability and social unrest from 134-44 BCE
 - 134 BCE: Tribune Gracchus proposed land reforms to give land from the state and wealthy back to the poor. He was killed
 - 91-88 BCE: Social War. Italian allies to Rome wanted citizenship. They got it
 - 82-79 BCE: Sulla appointed dictator with sole rule over Rome. Gives his power back to the senate after 2 years
 - 73-71 BCE: Third Servile War. Spartacus and his slave allies cause much destruction through Campania. They were killed
 - 49-44 BCE: Caesar illegally subdues the Gauls, invades Britain. Branded a criminal by the senate, crosses the Rubicon river, defeats political rivals, becomes dictator of Rome. Assassinated in one of the most famous and short-sighted murders in history
 - 44-27 BCE: Octavian claims uncles mantle as dictator, renames as Augustus Caesar, effectively ends the Republic constitution
