# Late Roman Greece
### Overview
 - Enormous surge of activity
 - Aegean becomes a transportation corridor to funnel wealth north to Constantinople
 - Presence of wealth in the Aegean stimulates development throughout Greece
	 - Late Roman landscape becomes intensively cultivated (but not populated)
 - Christian institutions spread mostly through urban areas with some development in suburban zones (Corinth)

### Greek Villas in the Late Empire
 - Very few new villas constructed in Greece during late Roman times, some grow in size and splendour
 - Third wave of villa construction after Middle Roman in Macedon from 3rd to 4th centuries
 - Epirus, Patras, Asea: Most villas abandoned by end of 3rd century, owners likely fled to nearby villages and towns
 - Sum: Fewer active villas in the landscape, those which survived appeared wealthy
 - Also new villa modifications
 - Villa of Herodes Atticus at Eua Loukou: Imperial property after death in 177 CE, late 3rd century damaged by Herulian attacks and earthquakes. Restored and used until end of fourth century
	 - Changes in early 5th century, basilica -> church, balneum -> workshop
	 - Villa site had become a makeshift monastery
 - Villas abandoned in 2nd and 3rd centuries are often recycled and ploughed over
 - Villas from the 4th-6th centuries see a variety of forms of reuse

### Cities in the Late Roman Period
 - After Pausanias (180) textual references decline dramatically, moreso after Emperor Caracalla grants Roman citizenship to all inhabitants of the empire in 212 (recording of patronage on new buildings loses value)
 - Rural intensification increases over Late ROman in Greece, cities do not expand to earlier sizes
	 - Decline in number, those that remain are smaller than before
 - Corinth experiences earthquake in 4th century
	 - Originally thought to signal the decline, recent work shows the exact opposite and Corinth prospered

### Late Roman Housing in Greece
 - Late Roman villas do not display the same levels of wealth as Italian villas
	 - Urban and suburban houses do
 - 5th century, many large urban houses had luxurious reception rooms for peers or clients (triclinia)
 - Best example: Massive mansion in the middle of old Athenian Agora
	 - Outside city walls, sign of changing urban social relations, wealthy aristocracy abandoning cities

### Changes to Urban Fabric
 - Decline in city numbers and urban area countered by surge in monumental buildings
 - Agoras are often filled with industrial workshops, markets, burials
 - Urban aristocracy (curiales) abandoning imperial duties in the city, moving to Constantinople or rural estates
 - Bishops and clergy given more imperial authority to run public affairs, new focus of Greek cities
	 - Churches, monasteries, baptisteries very important, some churches over tombs of martyrs beyond city walls
	 - Justinian (527-565 CE) encouraged building of churches throughout the eastern empire

### Late Roman Corinth
 - Declined over 5th and 6th centuries
 - Despite urban degradation, massive Christian basilica built at the adjacent port of Lechaion
	 - Possibly the largest in the Late Roman world, commissioned by eastern emperor
	 - Damaged first by an earthquake in 551, then destroyed by tsunami later that century
 - Christian sites often built at Aegean ports to provide for travellers on their way to Constantinople

### Palace of Galerius (293-311) in Thessaloniki
 - Caesar under Diocletian, chose Thessaloniki as his imperial capital, massive palatial complex built here
	 - Excavated between 1917-1968
 - Built at the very beginning of Late Antiquity, embodied idea of mini-Rome in the east
 - Many architectural elements would be replicated throughout Greece for the next several centuries
 - Included a monumental Rotunda (domed temple to Zeus), Constantine would convert this temple to a church
	 - Monumental arch also constructed on the path between the palace and the Rotunda
**The Rotunda**:
 - Decline of civic culture marked by the rarity of new public secular buildings, inscriptions, dedicatory statues to local city councillors
	 - New inscriptions or statues are dedicated either to local bishop or imperial officials, often recycled
 - Churches continue to be constructed or converted
	 - Art of mosaics remain advanced
 - Rotunda transformed into a church, mosaics built on the floor, walls, ceiling, and survive in fragmented form

### Futher Examples of Urban Transformation
 - Island of Kea: Three of four Classical towns are abandoned over Late Roman times
 - Gortyn on Crete: Shift in urban center, old center taken up by wooden housing and industrial kilns
 - Athens: New city wall built without the agora, pagan temples converted to churches
 - Argos: 400, city center taken over by houses and workshops, new urban center around local churches
 - Thessaloniki: Agora and public buildings abandoned between 300-400, replaced by pottery kilns
 - Sparta and Thespiae: Kastron built adjacent to larger Classical town, former city partly demolished while other parts were replaced by pottery workshops and kilns

### The Rise of the Kastra
 - Insecurity prompted most settlements to build internal defensive walls out of spolia between 3rd to 6th centuries
 - Fortified centers called kastra (castles), designed to house garrisons of militia and troops along with local administrators, the bishop, and his staff
 - Best exavated kastron in Greeceis at Rentina, east of Thessaloniki
 - Curiales leave the cities and insecurity builds, many cities shrink and reduced only to central kastra
	 - Forts come to represent small defended communities oriented around defense and Christian worship

### Reoccupying Ancient Defenses
 - As imperial armies battled incursions on all fronts, older landscape defenses were refortified
 - Hexamilion wall and kastron (block access to Peloponnese at the Isthmus of Corinth) overlaid earlier attempts dating to the Mycenaean period
	 - Industrial activity inside the kastron, more mixing of military and domestic life
 - Wall and fort built using spolia from classical sanctuary at Isthmia
 - Pass at Thermopylae also refortified in late antiquity
 - Hilltops last used in pre-Classical times were reoccupied as sites of refuge

### Death and Burial
 - Late Roman cemeteries continue to show massive differentiations in wealth
 - Biggest change: Intramural burial in the Late Roman period, particularly from 6th century
 - Upper classes and ecclesiastical leaders were buried in marble sarcophagi, middle classes in vaulted chamber toms, everyone else in cist graves, tile graves, or simple earthen pits
 - Christian symbolism appears more frequent in some cemeteries, either on artifacts or paintings
	 - Older pagan iconography still used, reinterpreted through a Christian view
 - Burial goods decline given Christian emphasis on spiritual vs materialistic afterlife
	 - Also people in urban spaces were increasingly poor
	 - Why we know comparatively less about pottery from the end of antiquity and the early middle ages

### Greek Pottery in the Late Empire
 - Table wares moving great distances in Late Empire on the grain ships carrying bulk food exports to Rome and Constantinople
	 - Rome relied on grain shipments from Carthage and further west
	 - Constantinople, by extension Greece and the Aegean, were directly connected with shipments from Egypt
 - Pottery included less sophisticated red-gloss wares, often with smooth surfaces instead of molded designes
	 - More orange than red
 - Over this period, Eastern Sigillatas replaced by ARS
	 - Italy received ARS from central and west Africa
	 - Greece received ARS primarily from Egypt
**African Red-Slip Ware (ARS)**:
 - Found all over the Mediterranean, C and D varieties are common post 200 CE (flatter and broader dishes)
 - 3rd and 4th centuries, ARS C appears with applied ornaments and stamps
	 - Crosses and chi rho stamps appear on ARS especially in 5th and 6th centuries
 - Shift in ARS designs over late antiquity (flatness, applique, stamps, christian iconography) is also seen in the few metal vessels that survive the period
	 - Always assumed metal vessels influenced the ceramics, reverse is also possible
**Phocean Red Slip**:
 - Italy dominated by African pottery in late antiquity, Greece shows more variety
 - Pottery produeced on west coast of Turkey in this period in Phocean Red Slip
	 - High numbers from 350-550 CE, reduced scale until it disappears around 650 CE
	 - Growth directly influenced by Constantinople
 - Rare examples, imitates African wares by shapes and stamped designs until 420, after this it takes the shape of tall deep bowls with pronounced overhanging rim
**Late Roman Amphoras (LRA)**:
 - Unlike Dressel and Lamboglia amphoras of the Republic and Principate, typologies are more ambiguous due to multitude of production locations and types all across the Mediterranean
 - Typological classification is essential in pottery studies to cope with enormous amounts of form and function
	 - Originally lumped together into too few categories, causing huge problems, two decades to regroup them
 - Made all over the Aegean, LRA 2 forms were especially widespread (extremely round with nib on bottom)
	 - All eastern Late Roman Amphoras found in Greece, particularly LRA 1 and 3 amphoras from Turkey and Syria
	 - LRA 1 and LRA 3 mostly contained olive oil or wine
 - These amphoras end production in the 7th to 8th centuries, oil & wine production also lessened but did not stop
	 - Likely these products were more popularly shipped in wooden barrels or skins after this period

### Eastern Survival
 - Last western emperor deposed in 476 CE, Odoacer sent eastern emperor Zeno the regalia of the western emperor, the east endured
 - Invasions over the Danube didn't destroy the eastern empire as Constantinople was a true fortress
	 - The city on the Golden Horn was impregnable from the Huns in the 5th century
 - Economic heart of the east is in Turkey, Syria, and Egypt. No direct threat of barbarian groups of Europe
 - Western empire collapsed, Greece flourished economically as wealth funneled into Constantinople via Aegean
	 - Economic boom continued until emperor Justinian (527-565 CE), he would result in effective end of the ancient world and the start of the medieval period.
