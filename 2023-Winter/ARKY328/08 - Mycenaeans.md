### Late Bronze Age Overview
 - Likely equates with the "Heroic Age" of later Greek Myth
 - Early in this period: Theran eruption, destabilizing southern Aegean society
 - Mycenaeans grow in political, economic strength over LBA I-II, by LBA III they control almost the entire Aegean
 - A series of catastrophes occur at the end of LBA III, result in the destruction of Mycenaean civilization and the abandonment of all palaces

### LBA Crete
 - The Middle Minoan II/Late Minoan IA period sees palaces quickly rebuilt after earthquakes of MM II
	 - Appear to become seats of elites, officials, their servants
	 - Dynastic palace model of Evans
	 - By the LM IB subphase, process is complete
 - Survey in Kavousi district of eastern Crete:
	 - Sites relocated early in LM period from mixed-crop locations into the lowlands, near coast and roadways
	 - Settlement nucleation, palaces appear to control agricultural production through specialized irrigation farming

### "Second" or "New" Palace Period (LM IA-IB)
 - Sees high settlement density unmatched until Roman times
 - Better oxen-driven ploughs
 - More efficient use of secondary products from animals (milk, leather, bones)
 - Further development in olive and grape production
 - Greater demand for agrarian surplus from palace complexes
 - Palaces begin to exert control in the landscape

### LM Knossos
 - Prior to Mycenean domination, not clear that Knossos itself was the seat of a king or queen
 - When rebuilt after the collapse of First Palaces (1700 BCE) may have still be ceremonial
 - Women are pictured predominantly on many Minoan frescoes at Knossos in LM I period
	 - May reflecting a privileged female role in power relations on Crete at this time

### LM IB Diplomacy
 - Don't know how LM diplomacy was undetaken
	 - Instructions or treaties written on clay tablets, perishable paper, hides?
 - Clay sealings hold a clue, on their underside the impressions of fibrous sheets have been detected at Akrotiri
 - By creating network of sealings shared between locales, a nexus of corresponence appears
	 - LM IB period between minor centers (Kato Zakro, Ayia Triada, Gournia, Sklavokampos) with Knossos

### Atlantis Destroyed?
 - Island wide destruction on Crete at the end of LM IB and all Second/New Palaces were destroyed except for Knossos, maybe Khania
 - Not related to Theran eruption, appears to have destabilized Minoan Crete but was not responsible for destroying it
 - Possible the chaos following the Theran catastrophe (enhanced factional politics towards dictatorship)
	 - Allowed Myceneans exert their dominance over Crete in LM II
 - Was Plato's allegory, national hubris and destruction of Atlantis, a story that combined tuue Theran eruption, decline of Minoans, and the militarised domination of the Mycenaeans

### The Theran Eruption
 - Debate about which exact period it occurred, likely between LM IA-IB
	 - C14 dates from Crete, Santorini date the eruption to 1628 BCE, LM IA
 - Marinatos (1939) theorized Crete was devastated by the eruption with tsunamis, ash, earthquakes
	 - Afterwards, Myceneans took over
 - Problem: Excavations at Akrotiri on Thera suggest LM IA pottery was used immediately before the eruption, LM IB pottery used at Minoan palaces when they were destroyed
 - Lag of at least 50 years between the Theran eruption and the Mycenean takeover of Crete, doesn't explain their takeover of the Minoans

### LBA Cyclades
 - Early LC I: islands closest to Crete (Thera, Melos, Miletos) experience Minoan acculturation
	 - Results in strong trade influence on the rest of the Cycladic islands, continues into the southern Greek mainland (not inland or in northern Greece)
 - Influences change after THeran eruption and Mycenaean takeover of Crete
	 - By LC II, ceramic imports on the islands switch from Crete to the mainland
 - Preference for Mycenaean goods over Minoan goods may have just been social
	 - Some evidence for military conquest of the Cyclades by mainland Minoans

### Akrotiri on Thera (Santorini)
 - LBA Cycladic settlement on Thera, buried by the eruption
	 - Bronze Age Pompeii
 - Excavations in 1969, much of the city was perfectly preserved
 - Town was typical Cycladic for LC I, heavily Minoanized with pottery, architectural styles
 - Several houses have been fully excavated:
	 - Xeste 3 was used in rites of passage for young girls (based on survivng frescoes)
	 - West House was an elite mansion that produced textiles, likely had international trade contacts

### Cultural Assimilation
 - Small ettlements on Cycladic islands mirror the alternating social, economic trends between Minoan, then Mycenaean, states
 - No longer the center of a unique civilization, the Cycladic islands continue to serve as focal points for later Greek colonization
	 - Eventually individual islands develop as independent city-states, then trade centers
 - Rest of the period, islands will see fluctuation between periods of relative autonomy to periods of complete domination of Greeks, Persians, Athenians, Romans

### LBA Mainland
 - Growth in MH was slow, changes over MH III to LH I to Minoan influence
 - At Mycenae, elite burials made in Grave Circles A, B, include richer Minoan material culture than the MH period
 - Evans thought Minoans were a secondary civilization influenced by Egyptions and Assyrians in EBA
	 - Responsible for stimulating Mycenaean growth, partially true
 - Rich material culture in the Mycenaean graves and palace at Pylos demonstrate their growing wealth and influence
	 - Tholos Tomb IV, LH I-II, may be the oldest tholos on the mainland

### Mycenaean Settlements
 - Villages and Farms in MH
	 - In LH period, acropoleis (upper towns) were centralizing and fortifying
 - Surveys show LH Mycenaean settlement system followed standard hierarchy:
	 - 1. Palace Complexes (mostly fortified)
	 - 2. Lesser fortified centers
	 - 3. Unfortified villages
	 - 4. Hamlets, individual farmsteads
 - Conversely: northern Greece (Aetolia, Epirus, Macedonia, Thrace) was still primarily a network of large villages and small urban sites on a smaller scale than southern Greece
 - Core Mycenaean settlements share characteristics:
	 - Architectural palatial center
	 - Built in commanding position, often fortified
	 - Near water and good agricultural land
	 - Situated at lones of communication between the sea and the interior
 - In MH, settlements had shared attributes but they appeared to be somewhat dissociated from each other (changes in LH)
 - Over LH I-II, center of Mycenaean society develops on Peloponnese and Attica, colony settlements further away
 - Main trends over LH I-II: Settlement consolidation and cemetery differentiation

### Settlement Consolidation
 - Began in the MH as settlements became increasingly rich, powerful, through contacts with Minoans
 - Over LH II, settlement consolidation by strong families or chiefs results in centralized areas controlling larger and larger territories
 - Example: Pylos comes to control all of Messenia, Mycenae controls the Argolid (plus Tiryns, Midea), Pellana controls Laconia

### Mycenaean Burials
 - Shaft graves reach their peak occurrence and opulence in LH I period
	 - Overall: Strong cultural continuity with the MH period, shaft graves of 1600-1450 BCE (LM I-II, aka Shaft Grave Period) control more elite material culture
 - Mycenae, Grave Circle A was re-enclosed in LH I as the citadel becomes a place of great political, economic importance
	 - the first tholos tomb appears here
 - Burials more commonly contain multiple individual, increasing importance of lineage
 - Diversity of tomb types among elites and high levels of conspicuous consumption indicate significant level of social competition, status
	 - Shaft graves, chamber tombs, tumuli, tholoi

### Mycenaean States of LH II
 - Each city is at the center of a successful polity (identifiable political entity)
	 - Some (Mycenae, Pylos) develop Minoan like palatial centers (sometimes mansions)
	 - Pellana is urban but non-palatial,
	 - Likely Athenian Acropolis had a palace of some sort, no evidence
 - First states developed during LH II, state-level organization emerged to better manage the centralization, wealth, labour that was generated by Mycenaean society
 - State societies had complex bureaucracies, specialized labour, forming horizontally and vertically stratified society

### LM II-III: Post-Palatial Crete
 - Knossos ruled over all of Crete during postpalatial period, almost certainly under control of mainland Mycenaean rather than Minoan elites by LM II
 - Knossos retained centralized role as palace center, dominated political and economic relations of the countryside
	 - Small Minoan statelets arose from LM IB destructions, may have been semi autonomous from Knossos
 - In 14th century BCE, during LM III (specifically LM IIIAI), palace at Knossos was destroyed for the final time

### Debating Destruction of Knossos
 - Two competing explanations depend on the date adopted
 - If destruction dates to late 13th to early 12th century BCE, aligns with destruction in Eastern Mediterranean and the fall off Hittite Empire of Anatolia
	 - Likely the fall of Knossos was part of larger-scale Mediterranean event in LM IIIC
	 - Bronze Age Collapse
 - If it dates to the early LM IIIA date in early 14th century BCE, cllapse of Mycenaean control on Crete is more likely
	 - Local Cretans rose up against their Helladic conquerors
 - Either way, loss of Knossos, the mainland Mycenaeans expanded with mass speed and efficiency
	 - Soldiers are at the forefront of this expansion, don't know why

### Mycenaean Material Culture
 - Influenced by Minoan stles, included lustrous dark-on-light ware and monochrome painted ware
	 - Nautical, animal, plant themes
 - By LH IIIA-B, Mycenaean pottery is very high technical quality, mass-produced, exported all over the Mediterranean
	 - Particularly as vessels for oil (stirrup jars), wine (kraters)
 - Material culture found in small amounts in the eastern Mediterranean, southern Italy (Greek colonies later develop)
 - Not much trade, exports of foodstuffs and textiles were minimal, used primarily to acquire exotic minerals for crafts like bronze-working
	 - Thus most Mycenaean material culture was consumed where it was made

### Female Figurines
 - Ceramic figurines found in tombs, childrens graves, shrines in Mycenaean controlled territories over LH II-III
 - Functions are unknown, suspected they were votive offerings, grave offerings, goddess or priestess figurines in shrines, fertility Mother-Goddess?
 - Priestesses figured prominently in Mycenaean+Minoan religions, women played central roles in religious festivals

### Mycenaeans in Italy
 - Pottery from 14th, 13th centuries BCE (LH II-III), 300 years over late Middle to early Recent Bronze Age has been found on Adriatic, Ionian coasts (Sicily, Sardinia)
	- Aegean civilizations were in contact with Italian Bronze Age peoples
 - Little found on the Tyrrhenian coast (Naples producing a form of Aegean coarseware pottery in RBA LH IIIB-C)
 - Much pottery likely imported by Phoenician traders from the east
	 - Some cases, clear Aegean potters were working in Italy
	 - Other cases, looks like local potters imitating coveted Mycenaean forms and decorations
	 - Pottery made and distributed for an elite clientele, much of it found in burial contexts
 - Small zone containing Mycenaean pottery in Etruria, Sardinia + Eastern Sicily, was rich in Copper
	 - Likely looking to exploit mineral deposits and trade with central Europeans (Urnfield culture)
	 - Phoenicians were the middle-men traders
