# Early Roman Greece
### Greece in the Second Century BCE
 - Fighting between Hellenistic kingdoms in the late 3rd century BCE gave Rome an excuse to intervene and gain control over the politics of the Eastern Mediterranean
	 - Over next 200 yeras, Hellenistic world absorbed into Rome
 - Second century BCE saw a series of four conflicts (The Macedonian Wars) involving the Romans and Macedonians
 - Entire eastern Mediterranean world came under ROman control after the last Ptolemy, Cleopatra, was defeated by Octavian at Actium in 31 BCE

### The Arrival of Rome
 - Key period was 148-146 BCE, abolition of Macedonian state, defeat of the Achaean League at the Battle of Corinth led to the creation of the fifth Roman provine: Macedonia
	 - Roman control over the wealth of Macedon further fed colonial expansion
 - Rome opened Greece to international markets, wealthy Romans invested in Greek estates, commerce, industries
 - Did not stimulate rapid prosperity in Greece, Roman arrival resulted in destruction of cities and crops, enslavement

### Romanization
 - Like Rome's subjugation of Italy, Romanization of Greece worked both ways
 - Rome captured Greece (Horace = Graecia Capta) through major political cchange, tax-raising, new trade networks, cultural influences involved in empire
 - Greece also captured Rome, Italian elites based their identities on idealized Classical-Hellenistic Greek art, architecture, literature, social etiquette (Philhellenism)
 - Early Roman period was a period of social breakdown in Greece, great inequality between cities

### Late Hellenistic Provinces
 - Roman conquest interrupted Greek landscape organization
 - In Classical era: City states and ethnic territories were small and numerous
	 - Now: Centralization of social and economic activities into fewer centers
 - End of Late Hellenistic period: Greece divided into only two administrative zones
	 - Province of Macedonia in the north
	 - Province of Achaia in the south

### Evidence for Late Hellenistic Decline
 - Survey around Koressia on Kea: Late Hellenistic times, polis shrank to size of village with no recovery until medieval times
 - Survey in Boeotia: Town of Haliartos was destroyed by Romans in 171 BCE, never recovered. Surrounding landscape was depopulated and poor in Late Hellenistic/Early Roman
 - Berbati survey in NE Peloponnese: Landscape emptied out over the Late Hellenistic, only one significant site remained in the whole valley
 - Same trends in Attica and Laconia, core Classical regions experience decline and depopulation in the Hellenistic and early Roman periods
 - Overall: Early Roman Greece was less populated, less intensively cultivated, less urbanized than during the Classical or Hellenistic periods

### Early Greco-Roman Material Culture
 - Late Hellenistic and Early Roman periods, Italian transport amphorae increase in number, staggering variety used to transport predominantly wine and oil to and from the Aegean
 - Imports of red-gloss (terra sigillata) tablewares and Roman amphorae start to pick up right at the end of the period
 - One medium of material culture Romans adopted from Greeks: Sculptural styles

### Hellenistic Art
 - Elite sculpture in Hellenistic Greece sought to make elites appear godlike with contorted bodies and gestures, grandiose poses
 - End of democratic ethos through Greece removed normal citizens from having any political role
	 - Influenced art, refocused on the basics, making the most of lower status jobs and social life
 - Overall: Statuary becomes more individualized, focuses on unique features of people
	 - Donations of official statue portraits to living people, instead of a medium for commemoration, became popular in 4th cecntury BCE
	 - Hellenistic kings would often use the Panhellenic sanctuaries like Delphi and Olympia to showcase their wealth

### Early Roman Influences on Greek Material Culture
 - Roman wealthy sought cultural credentials, natural model was Greece
 - Wealthy Romans had two avenues for adopting Greek cultural models
	 - Easiest to take Greek material culture by force/sale, display it in Italy
	 - Later, more desirable to commission new Italian works in Greek styles or by Greek artists
 - Roman demand for Greek art fueled Hellenistic eclecticism movement
	 - Classical and Hellenistic styles mixed depending on buyer preference
 - Sculptures began using Classical Greek bodies (more rigid than Hellenistic bodies), an impossible ideal for most people. Heads of businessment or soldiers with serious, unflattering exressions
 - Semi realist style of art as a product of Athens and prot island of Delos
	 - Soon, rest of Athenian society wanted this new Roman style of art to project strong self-made personalities
 - Style shifted to other goods as well
	 - Large marble vases and altars, conspicuous consumption for the rich, referenced both Classical, Hellenistic art
	 - Neo-Attic style
	 - Famous example: Medici Vase, krater carved from Pentelic marble, 170 cm tall
 - Mixing of styles led to much confusion for early Classical art historians

### Roman Landscape Legacy in Greece
 - Where cities survived (rarely expanded) there were major building works, rich townhouses, rich rural villas
 - All due to interactions with rich Romans and polarization of wealth among the remaining Greeks
 - Two processes were responsible:
	 - Displacement of prosperity, whereby the wealth of Macedonian Greece was shifted to new colonial landscapes established by Rome
	 - Rome introduced significant changes in landownership. Roman villas (rich) pushed out middle and lower class Greeks, monopolized the rural landscape
 - Over Early Roman period (1st century BCE), areas of prosperity shift
 - Early Hellenistic: Northern Greece benefited from the great wealth of Alexanders Empire, south declined out of royal neglect
 - Late Hellenistic/Early Roman: Prosperity of the north declined outside of Macedon, instead of growth in agricultural land (Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae) it shifts to new places
	 - Roman colonial foundations/reconstructions at Corinth, Patras, Thessaloniki, Gortyn on Crete
	 - First time since Mycenaeans that Crete experiences Crete
 - Environmental and Archaeological evidence: Reasons for displacement of prosperity is historical contingency (luck) and geography
 - Rich Classical period areas were risky, external markets of western Europe were hard to reach, soils easily eroded with warfare, agriculture overproduction, unpredictable climate
 - Macedonians had vast territory with smaller populations, lots of room for growth, especially since wealthy Macedonians were living off of Alexander's imperial riches
	 - Romans focused here because there was wealth to exploit
 - Acarnania, Aetolia, Epirus: Also marginal during Classical, benefiting from large territories and slow urbanization
	 - Not as fortunate, unlike the Macedonians this population was poor
	 - People deported to Nicopolis, Patras, Corinth, the rest sent to Italy as slaves
 - **Changes in Landownership**:
	 - Numerous small farms of the Classical and early Hellenistic period replaced by fewer middle and upper class Roman villas
	 - In areas with slow growth in city and countryside over the Archaic-Classical periods (northern Greece, Sparta), we see expansion of rural settlement with the arrival of Rome
	 - Three reasons:
		 - Roman elites snapped up empty lands as investment
		 - Roman rulers sought to punish Aegean cities who opposed them by carving up their territories, doling it out to favoured people
		 - Urban middle and upper class Greek houses had limited areas for large-scale processing and storage of farm products. Needed rural processing centers if they were going to farm with Roman intensity, needed villas

### End of the Hellenistic Period
 - Greece became a special Roman province, Hellenistic world imprinted on Roman art, government, philosophy, and religion
 - Is history inevitable or random?
	 - What if Alexander took his army west instead of east?
	 - If Alexander lived, could he have solidified his empire, creating a lasting dynasty to eventually displace Rome?
	 - If Alexander failed, would the Roman empire have succeded?
