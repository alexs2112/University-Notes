# Archaic Foundations, Early Expansions
### Roman Republic Overview
1. The Latins: Small tribal group surrounded by larger polities, ruled by chiefs from Alba Longa
2. Latial culture: Similar to Villanovan, didn't experience same economic + cultural expansions as the Etruscans
3. Regal Period (753-509 BCE) and the early + mid republic (509-200 BCE) are the most poorly documented periods of Roman history
4. Period of conquests and submissions, warfare and colonization being common
5. Rome conquered through policy and alliances, allowed them the labour and wealth to continue expanding by financing and supporting the military
 - Latin cultural sequences: Protovillanovan, Villanovan, Transitionary, Orientalizing

### Latial Culture
 - LC I has similar culture to protovillanovans:
	 - Oval huts with thathed roofs
	 - Handmade black burnished pottery
	 - Hut urns for cremation burials
	 - Cemetery evidence shows settlement populations were anywhere from 100-300 people
	 - Mythical period of the Kings of Alba Longa, ruled over Latium as chieftains from the Alban Hills
 - By LC II period:
	 - Inhumations begin to appear, replace cremation burials
	 - Men buried with miniature weapons, women with spindle whorls and personal ornaments, elderly with drinking sets
	 - Pottery more geometric-style designs
 - Earliest evidence for Greek writing: Osteria dell'Osa in Latium
	 - Inscription (etched into a one-handed pottery vessel in cremation burial) reads "eulin"/"euoin", interpreted as a personal name (perhaps of the deceased)
 - Over LC III period, populations east of the Tiber started to see increased wealth (Etruscan trade)
 - Real growth occurs in th LC IV period, more land being cultivated, grapes and olives grown (unknown scale)
	 - Populations begin to increase
	 - Cemetery: Castel di Decimi, shows mostly poor population with few exceptionally wealthy people
 - Two most famous tombs of early Latium come from ancient Praeneste: Barberini and Bernardini tombs
	 - Bernardini tomb was exceptional (for prominent woman)
	 - Burial goods so rich that early scholars thought Latium must have been under Etruscan control
 - Another artifact likely from Bernardini Tomb is the Praeneste Fibula
	 - Inscribed with the earliest example of Old Latin yet discovered
	 - MANIOS MED FHEFHAKED NVMASOIO -> Manius made me for Numerius
 - During LC IVA period, wattle and daub oval-shaped thatched huts replaced by rectilinear houses with stone foundations and roof tiles
 - 6th century BC: Expensive grave goods largely disappear from burials all over Tyrrhenian Italy (including Etruria)
	 - Wealth being used by the living, not the dead, lavish grave goods replaced by expensive public buildings like temples
 - Over 5th century BCE: Wars between Etruscan centres left Rome without a leader allowing the people to decide how they wanted to be governed
	 - City was effectively a republic

### Early Republican Rome
 - Rome was a bridge site, situated on major river route (Tiber) and major land route (Etruria to Latium and Campania)
 - Roman Legend: 509 BCCE the Roman people and senate deposed the last King of Rome (Lucius Tarquinius Superbus) and adopted a republic constitution
	 - From this point on, senate would elect two consuls for a single year term to make decisions previously made by the monarchy
 - Changes in political function of spaces were already ocurring
	 - Most symbolic feature of Roman republican values: Foro Romano (Roman Forum)

### Archaeology of the Forum
 - Greek agora was multi-purpose place for commercial and political acctivity
 - Roman forum strictly political and religious purposes
 - Archaeological evidence suggest the forum was originally a marketplace before adopting a more formal political and religious character
 - Some of Rome's oldest monuments built surround the Forum
	 - Royal residence (Regia, 8th century BCE)
	 - Temple of Vesta (7th century BCE)
	 - Lapis Niger (6th century BCE shrine)
 - Roman forum would see numerous modifications over time
 - One of the first developments: Draining the marshlands between the hills
 - In 1930s, Mussolini envisioned a New Rome as vast metropolis extending all the way to the coast. Also highlight imperial Roman past to legitimize fascist politics
	 - Large element: Via dei Fori Imperiali, planned as giant road for procession of military parades
	 - Almost 40k square meters of the city was demolished, including ancient, medieval, renaissance buildings
	 - Exposed new segments of the Forum between Piazza Venezia and the Coliseum

### Cloaca Maxima
 - Rome was first settled, area of the Forum was a marshy wetland, one of the first large-scale infrastructural projects was the Cloaca Maxima
 - Greatest Sewer: To drain the marshlands (eventually to remove human waste) from the settlement into the Tiber
 - Originally an open air canal (possibly by Etruscan architects)
	 - Last king: Tarquinius Superbus cited as ruler who ordered original canal to be enclosed and buried
 - Secondary canals eventually cut into Cloaca Maxima to help with drainage from public buildings with interior plumbing
 - Still in use today

### Rome and its Neighbours
 - Archaic Italy: Space of intense aggressive competition between various small city-states
	 - Roman aggression linked to acquiring grain, constant problem until middle ages
 - Expanding economic relationships and military superiority helped fuel Rome's expansion, military pressure was not enough
	 - Needed support from other Italian communities in the form of labour and resources

### Roman Conquest of Italy
 - Traditional conquest narrative of Italy is result of ancient sources available to most early historians
	 - Historians wrote in great details about events before their own times
	 - Problem: Authors writing as if Rome was predestined to be a regional (eventually imperial) power. Not the case until after the Second Punic War

### Early Roman Conquests and Colonies
 - Legend: Roman victory against the Latin League at the Battle of Lake Regillus resulted in the Cassian Treaty of 493 BCE. Beginning of Rome's domination in Latium
	 - Surround settlements of Sabines, Aequi, Volscians were required to fight for Rome
 - Romans also agreed to share spoils of war and share in colonization of conqured lands in an informal way
	 - Not organized state-led colonization
 - Most of the newly settled centers developed into large towns, remained prosperous over the whole Roman period
	 - Many in poorly defendable locations, close to prime agricultural land
	 - Still not sufficient for growing populations, imported wheat from Etruscans, Volsci, Greeks, Sicilians

### Rome v Etruscans
 - Roman rule over Latium escalated conflict with Etruscans
 - Closest Etruscan neighbour, Veii, major competitor. Strategically possible that Veii could have defeated Rome and taken its place as dominant city of Latium
 - In 396 BCE, Romans conquered Veii after a 10 year siege during their third major conflict
	 - At this point, ager Romanus (public rural lands owned by Roman state) was twice as large as in 509 BCE
 - Adopted aspects of Etruscan culture, included column architecture, arched gates, private residences with an atrium, large-scale temples on raised stepped platforms
	 - Also borrowed victory processions (Roman Triumph), robe styles, divination

### Archaeological Case of Veii
 - Plutarch: Weren't satisfied with defeating Veii, in 396 they killed the whole male population and destroyed the city entirely. Abandoned until late 1st century BCE
 - Archaeological evidence doesn't agree, no evidence for fire or destruction. Clear evidence for continued occupation.
	 - Defenses of the town were updated, cult sites, roads, cemeteries still used, countryside intensively settled
 - Veii became a busy market town at an important crossroads that supported a local aristocratic class

### Why Fight Instead of Trade
 - Roman aggression was linked to acquiring gran. Two main reasons:
 1. Roman aristocratic society had a militarized ethos where warfare was needed to gain status and enter public office.
	 - Over time, became true for plebian (general public) society too as a way to reduce social tensions to acquire more land for the poor.
	 - Known from grave assemblages
 2. Militarized ethos came from the anarchic and militarized interstate environment by archaic Latium. Survival meant being aggressive with neighbours
	 - Rome was so successful, not due to better army, because of policy of incorporating former enemies into their society
	 - Known from archaeology of Roman expansion

### Roman War Machine
 - Prior to 550 BCE, no Roman army. Clans of Latium had war-bands and charismatic leaders.
 - Over the early Republic, Roman army adopted a hoplite phalanx model from the Etruscans
 - Armor could include bronze or hardened leather cuirass, greaves, bronze helmet
	 - Most soldiers carried long throwing spears and a short thrusting sword, slashing swords are known
 - From the 4th-2nd centuries BCE, professionalization of the army continued to evolve
	 - Block phalanx dropped in favour of more organic and specialized roles
	 - Manipular legion

### 4th Century War with Gauls
 - Early 4th century, group of Gauls from France crossed into northern Italy, threatened Roman allies
	 - After Roman ambassadors insulted them they decided to march on Rome
 - 387 BCE, Gauls arrived north of Rome and defeated sizable Roman army, entering and sacking the city
 - Historical debate if it even occurred. Sources lived centuries after it occurred, no archaeological evidence for the sack

### Roman Expansion into Italy
 - After Veii and the Battle of Allia, Rome attacked by other Etruscan cities north of the Tiber.
	 - Rome responded aggressively, 350 BCE they agreed on a truce
	 - Same time expanding southward through Latium
 - Ancient sources: Rome made numerous treaties, notably with Samnites and Carthaginians
	 - Lands of interest: Fertile and rich Campania
	 - War broke out in 343 BCE between Samnites and Greek city of Capua
	 - Rome intervened on Capua's behalf, drove out Samnites
 - Shortly after: Latin League revolted against Rome for being treated like subjects rather than allies
 - Defeated in 338 BCE, lands incorporated into the ager Romanus while their cities given a new municipium status, inhabitants receiving Roman citizenship

### Archaeology of Municipium
 - Equivalent of a small town or city-state not absorbed by Rome itself
	 - Kept most of their own administrators and aristocrats
 - Two classes of town:
	 - Civitas Optimoiure: Citizens granted full Roman citizenship with voting rights
	 - Civitas Sine Suffragio: Some rights, could not vote
 - Not many archaeological differences between them. Historical sources offer best evidence
 - Material evidence comes in three main forms:
	 - Centuriation
	 - Spread of Roman roads
	 - More nuanced urban settlement patterns from survey and excavation

### Centuriation
 - Process remains one of the more visible archaeological indicators of Roman colonization
 - Roman surveyors (agrimensores) laid out sophisticated grids to create seettlement and farming lots
 - Anchor of the grid system was establishment of two parallel secondary roads at intervals of 100 actus (3.5 km)
	 - Further subdividing into 20x20 actus blocks called centuria
	 - Some cases of ditches and berms at the edges of these roads and centuria

### Roman Roads
 - Road building represented Roman dominance in the landscape
	 - First major road project: Via Appia, linked Rome with Capua
 - Both strategic communicative links between centers and displays of hegemonic Roman leadership
 - Three main types of road:
	 - Viae Publicae: Consular, praetorian, military roads built w/ public funds
	 - Viae Privatae: Rural agrarian roads, built with private funds, connected parts of the landscape with viae publicae
	 - Viae Vicinales: Rural roads, often earthen paths, connecting farms or villages with public or private roads
 - Different terms for road construction techniques:
	 - Viae Terrenae: Dirt roads
	 - Viae Glareata: Leveled gravel roads
	 - Viae Munitae: Regulation engineered roads
 - Roman road engineering was adapted from both the Etruscans and the Cathaginians
 - For the viae munitae, ditch was excavated and filled with large stone boulders. Next, a layer of well-sorted cobbles was placed to help with drainage. Covered by a layer of sand or gravel to level the road. Finally, layer of metalling was inserted, often made of interlocking and cambered paving stones
 - Major consular roads, appeared about a generation after an area was integrated, only linked economically and strategically important places (bypassing older cities)
