### “Minding the Gap”: Thinking About Change in Early Cycladic Island Societies from a Comparative Perspective.
 - Rutter's Gap (1984): Period of missing knowledge in the Cyclades (material, local or exported) between Early to Middle Bronze Age
 - Explore two explanatory models:
	 - Association with climate-induced collapse
	 - Maritime transition from canoes to sail-driven shipping
 - Third Millenium BCE as a period of burgeoning island societies
	 - Long-range sea traffice
	 - Crises in several island cultures towards the end, increasing external penetration
 - Rutter sought to identify outlier objects from contexts beyond the Cyclades, and contemporary with the gap

### 30 Years On
 - Three questions to focus on:
	 - Do we possess a demonstrable continuous sequence right across the gap in the Cyclades?
		 - No, but close
	 - Do we know of more material to plug parts of the gap?
		 - Yes, jug from Palamari on Skyros, jar from Early Minoan 3 Knossos
	 - When, in absolutely chronoligcal terms, was the gap?
		 - As early as 2300 BCE, somewhere between 24th, 23rd century BCE

### Explanatory Frameworks
 - No lack of possible causes for this phenomenon
	 - Nucleation to explain widespread abandonment of settlements, shifts in community ideology regarding material culture, burials
		 - New sense of insecurity?
		 - Critical mass of population?
		 - Result of changing maritime technology (sail-driven)
	 - How much to be attributed to external agency
		 - Abrupt climate change
		 - Influx of newcomers
		 - Epidemics with growing interaction
