### Environment
 - A series of microecologies that require specific cultural considerations from their inhabitants
 - People who live in these microecologies interact and influence each other in complex network of human environmental interactions
 - Several seas and basins, lots of mountains
 - Lots of earthquakes and seismic activity

### Mediterranean Climate
 - Dry summer subtropical climate, really hot dry summers, cool wet winters
 - Alternating subtropical high pressure zone:
	 - In the summer, zone expands poleward, clear skies and high temperatures
	 - Winter, contracts towards equator, cooling westerly winds
 - Most of Greece and Italy experiences this Mediterranean Climate
	 - Unlike Greece, more microregional variation in Italy

### Flora of Greece and Rome
 - Coniferous, Deciduous forests
 - Much of the central and northern areas of both regions are forested, size changes depending on period
 - Both late Bronze Age and the Roman periods are often associated with mass deforestation for grain cultivation
 - Maquis/Macchia: Low, dense evergreen shrugs, dry coastal areas with acidic siliceous soils (sandstones, volcanic tuff)
 - Garrigue/Phrygana: Same as macchia, less dense, grows on alkaline calcareous soils (limestones)
 - Both types of shrubs evolved to survive frequent droughts
	 - Hard to travel through, very dense and tough
	 - Even harder to find artifacts in it
 - **Mediterranean Trinity**:
	 - Relative importance of Grain, Olives, Grapes
	 - Engine moving these societies forward
	 - Olive Trees were distributed around the mediterranean from trade (possibly slow and unintentional)

### Short History of Early Archaeology of Greece and Rome
 - Interest in the Greek and Roman past begins immediately after the western empire collapses over the 5th-6th century CE
 - Medieval populations in both Greece and Rome explore, contemplated, used the physical remains of the ancient world
	 - Charlemagne claimed direct political and cultural connections witht he Roman world to legitimize his imperial policies
	 - Popes in Rome used elements of Roman structure to build churches
	 - Colosseum in Rome
		 - Began as Ampitheater, then turned to Chapel -> Cemetery -> Market -> Quarry -> Fortress -> Garden -> Pilgrimage Site -> Historic Site -> Museum -> Concert Venue
		 - Use and reuse the place for different purposes

### Origins of Classical Archaeology
 - Academic popularity began during the Renaissance, 15th-16th century
 - First scientific study of the classics was undertaken at the University of Gottingen in the 1760s
 - Johann Winckelmann  (1717-1768)
	 - German Librarian, Antiquarian
	 - Theorized historical reconstruction
	 - Shifted focus of classical studies from Italy to Greece
 - Grand Tour
	 - Young aristocratic men from northwestern Europe would tour Italy to contemplate ancient history, collect souvenirs, paint, eat, drink
	 - Prerequisite for most of the most prestigious English social clubs
	 - Typically involved only Italy, some explored Ottoman controlled Greece
 - First excavations in Greece and Rome
	 - Italians, Greeks, Brits, Germans had all been digging in Greece and Rome prior to archaeological methodology
	 - Grand Tour was partly responsible, artifact hunting by pilgrims, antiquarians predates it
	 - Two Italian sites of Ostia and Tivoli are famous examples
 - Pompeii and Herculaneum
	 - Late 16th century, early 18th century, mid 18th century both sites were positively identified
	 - Haphazard and sporadic digging occurred from 1750-1860 until Giuseppe Fiorelli became director (more scientific rigor)
 - Troy and Mycenae
	 - Heinreich Schliemann excavated both Hisarlik (thought to be ancient Troy) and Mycenae in the 1870s, in 1880s he excavated the Mycenaean citadel at Tiryns
