### Classical Art in Context
 - Finding examples is rare, most marble+bronze sculptures attributed to Classical Greece are actually Roman copies, don't know how accurate they are
 - Most did not survive, lots of statues out of wood and painted on wooden planks
 - Literacy was low, sculpture contained figural depictions from the oral traditions
 - Marble, Ceramic, Bronze statuary meant to be painted, many had eyes or held items

### Red Figure Pottery
 - New pottery in Athens at the end of the Archaic, lasted into early Hellenistic
 - Similar to black-figure, black gloss left on backgrounds with red clay subjects, details often outlined in a third colour
 - Allowed Greek potters more refinement and individualistic styles, clear distinctions between different potters
 - Widely produced in Greece and Magna Grecia

### White-Ground Ware
 - Painting style popular from 500-450 BCE
 - Pottery covered in white slip of kaolinite (fine white clay) and painted
	 - Look more expensive (like ivory) or wall paintings
 - Much less durable than black and red figure, used primarily as votive or in burials

### Classical Pottery as Art
 - Art Historians: Classical pottery is near the pinnacle of Classical Greek art
 - Original Context: Potters were low status craftsmen compared to painters, sculptors
	 - Painted pottery meant to emulate vessels made of bronze, silver, gold (mostly recycled)
 - Archaic art more formalized, less individualism to sculpture, pottery, painting
 - Classical art on verge of emotional, naturalized forms and expressionless faces, heightened senses of freedom and personal responsibility
 - Ceramic painting provides a glimpse into domestic lives of women
	 - Higher classes: In charge of all domestic affairs, largely confined to the house
	 - Women in lower middle and lower classes would have left all the time to work fields
	 - Guarded resource, similar to modern Taliban

### Classical Monumental Architecture
 - Only change from Archaic times: Larger with more sculptural flourish
 - Theaters became more common, Drama emerged from religious festivals and became part of public display
 - Theatrical dramas performed in agora and on hill slopes, theaters become monumentalized reflecting importance of Greek performance

### Classical Period Burial
 - Archaic: Aristocrats used wealth to create lavish burial displays
 - Classical: Decreased as reflection of polis ethos, condemns ostentation by the rich
 - Instead of expensive statues most middle to upper class burials had sculpted stone grave markers (stelae)
	 - Became more ostentatious during Peloponnesian war
	 - Area of burial often outlined by short stone enclosure, Peribolos
 - Urban cemeteries built on roadsides leading into the city for travellers
 - Rural cemeteries appear closer to farmhouses for families and guests
	 - Reminds travellers who owns the land
 - Grave Stelae: 5th century Athens, as many female as male figured gravestones, twice as many with both males and females together
	 - Growth of middle class, new balance in genders
	 - Most famous: Hegeso, found in Kerameikos cemetery in Athens
 - Group tombs disappear entirely, people buried individually
 - Most Greeks interred individuals in simple earthen graves
	 - Athenians cremated their dead, ashes in krater or amphora
	 - Northern Greeks continued to use lavish chamber tombs

### Urban Life
 - Most Classical towns grew organically out of Geometric-Archaic period settlements
 - Houses largely under management of women, managed work, household activities, budget
 - Men expected to frequent public spaces like lawcourts, agora, gymnasium, dining-clubs
 - Housing blocks may have been purchased by groups of people of the same economic profiles, professions, or relatives

### Domestic Architecture
 - Rise of citizen rights and family wealth stimulated investment in house architecture
	 - Family enclosed as private unite, spaces for family, animals, reception
	 - Most Greeks were farmers, even those in cities
 - Oikos (family unit) created widely comparable house size, design across most poleis
 - Mediterranean climate helps make central open courtyard a natural focus for houses, surrounded by different rooms in a rectangular structure
 - Little fixed ornamentation or decoration
 - Outside the poleis, peasant mudbrick houses were still common
 - Middle/Upper classes, women and men had separate spaces, likely much internal variation
	 - Women worked in the gynaikonitis/gynaeceum, may have been locked from the outside
		 - More mobile decor than the mens space
	 - Mens space in adronitis/andron, for formal drinking parties where male guests were entertained
 - Courtyard was an important place, accessible from most ground floor rooms
 - Excavations only reveal the ground floor of these structures, assumed much of the womens space on the top floors of houses
 - Rural Houses:
	 - No formalized separations of spaces, impractical
	 - Most were two rooms iwth a small yard
	 - Occupied by poor peasants, agricultural tenants, slaves, maybe seasonal for urban farmers
	 - Some rural houses were far larger and richer than urban ones (relaxed egalitarian ethos)

### Classical Village
 - Villages are known, few are excavated, may have acted as landscaped foci for dispersed farms far from urban centers
 - Loose settlements with farmhouses separated by walled enclosures
 - Some houses had towers, for display or defense (robbers)
 - Most villages had associated rural cemeteries, dining halls for local men, no obvious nucleated center or agora

### Trend at the End of the Classical Period
 - Power of most poleis declined
	 - Politically can flourish if left unhindered, fragile to social, political, military stress from both internal and external sources
 - Over 350s, 340s, Phillip II (king of Macedon and Persian vassal) attempted to unite the Greek world by conquering all the city states
	 - Defeated Athens, Thebes in 338 BCE, achieved his pan-Hellenic dream (minus Sparta) shortly before being assassinated in 338 BCE
	 - Son, Alexander, would take Greek culture far into the east, conquering the Persian empire
 - Greece: Society turns more inward and away from public presentation
	 - More sympathetic portrayal of women and children in artwork and grave stelae
 - Class distinctions become more apparant as individual families emphasize their individuality
