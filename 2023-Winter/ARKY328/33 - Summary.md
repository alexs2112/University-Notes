### Core Tenants of Archaeological Interpretation
1. We cannot cherry pick evidence (choose to only present data that furthers our point, hide data that disproves it)
2. Evidence must be explainable through the logic of historical science (stratigraphy, context, typology, chronology)
3. Cannot make a claim based on negative or weak evidence, deflect the burden of proof to critics
4. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, unproven hypotheses can't form the foundation of new theories or understandings
