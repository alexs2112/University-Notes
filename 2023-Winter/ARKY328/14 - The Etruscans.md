 - The Etruscans were the dominant cultural group on the Italian Peninsula during this period
 - No centralized government, culturally affiliated Etruscan League of city states
 - Dominance based primarily on economic advantage, declined sharply once removed

### Herodotus and the Etruscans
 - Perils of uncritically accepting literary accounts of ancient societies
 - Ancient authors, historians: Obvious they were created from a colony of settlers
	 - Herodotus: Etruscans were settlers from Lydia
	 - Hellanicus of Lesbos: Offshoot of the Pelasgians
	 - Thucydides: Once inhabited Lemnos and Athens, Pelasgian = Tyrrhenian
 - Problem: Material evidence indicates they were an evolution of Villanovan society, no sudden replacement of material culture by foreign groups

### Etruscan Society
 - Best evidence comes from burial contexts
	 - Upper classes buried in chamber tombs, grave goods include fine pottery and metalwork
 - Consumers of imported luxuries: Pottery from Greece, Ivory + Silver from Near East
	 - Regolini-Galassi silver vessels
	 - Great golden fibula
 - 6th century BCE: Producing own pottery and metalwork of exceptional quality
	 - Masters at pouring bronze
	 - No marble, statues and reliefs from clay
 - Tomb paintings: General social equality between genders
	 - Paintings of women wearing outdoor clothes, more public lives
 - Tomb paintings reveal Etruscan origin for Roman Republic things
	 - Togas
	 - Fasces (double headed axe inside bundle of sticks, symbol of authority)
	 - Curule chair
	 - Public blood ritual at funerary rites -> public gladiatorial combat (no gladiators in Etruscan society)

### Eastern Influences
 - Torelli, 1976: Four main phases of eastern influences:
 - 750-670: Villages coalescing into towns
	 - Introduction of wheel-made pottery, Greek colonial styles
	 - Greater specialization of labour + crafts
 - 670-630: Rise of urban society, social classes
	 - Aristocratic families, praenomen-nomen system of nomeclature
	 - Adoption of writing
	 - Artistic reception of Greek myths and pottery shapes
 - 630-580: Arrival of Greeks in Etruscan communities
	 - Beginning of sculpture, wall painting, monumental architecture
	 - Increased Etruscan pottery production for local consumption + foreign export
	 - Aristocratic consumption of foreign imported goods
 - 580-480: Increased aristocratic status and power, decrease in social fluidity
	 - Confining of Greek artisans, merchants to controlled sites (Graviscae, Pyrgri)
	 - Rise of Etruscan urban demos (people below aristocratic class)

### Pottery
 - Villanovan: Made in thick-walled (coarse) impasto style
 - Etruscan: Refined look with Bucchero ware: Black, thin-walled pottery on wheel
 - Bucchere maybe to resemble more expensive bronze vessels
 - Common design: Red on white slip (Phoenicians), terracotta roofing decorations, sarcophagi
 - Noble Bastard:
	 - Aristonothes Krater signed by its painter
	 - One side shows Odysseus blinding the cyclops, other depicts Etruscan naval battle
	 - Aristonothes: Noble/Best Bastard, illegitimate son of Greek aristocrat in Etruria

### Metalwork
 - Masters of working bronze and iron
 - Particularly complex bronze statues and mirrors
	 - Large scale sculptures produced, few survive (Chimera of Arezzo)

### Settlement
 - Cities developed out of Villanovan villages at Tarquinia, Cerveteri, Veii, Vulci
 - Appear early in Orientalising period, operated in city-state model
	 - Likely influenced by both Greeks and Phoenicians
 - Countryside of Etruria was resettled from each of the main settlements in peer-polity type model
	 - Each city had a dependent hinterland of subcommunities, often on hilltops
 - Uniform material culture and common language, social diversity within regions and cities
 - Tarquinia:
	 - First true Etruscan city, gained influence from control over mineral resources from Tolfa Hills
	 - Largest known Etruscan temple (Ara Della Regina)
	 - Necropolis of Monterozzi, over 6k burials
		 - Tomb of the Leopards, Tomb of the Bulls
 - Gravisca:
	 - Trading center for Tarquinia, original settlement of post holes of simple huts around Aphrodite shrine
	 - Successive building phases of the shrine represent growth of settlement
	 - Many votive offerings include inscribed names, tell us about the gods worshipped here

### Architecture
 - More complex than the Villanovans due to increasing Greek and Phoenician influences
 - Highly organized houses with series of interconnected rooms and private courtyard
	 - Stone foundations, solid mudbrick walls, roofed with terracotta tiles
 - Cities demonstrate high political and social organization
 - Architectural marvels of the Roman world prefigured by Etruscans
	 - Atrium: Important to both, entrance hall with open roof and rainwater basin

### Temples
 - Polytheistic religion, adapted from indigenous beliefs mixed with Greek pantheon
	 - Grave goods, likely afterlife
 - Augury and haruspicy: Omens from natural phenomena, organs of sacrificed animals for signs
 - Early temples were simple mudbrick, 700-600 BCE they were solid stone structures with Tuscan columns
	 - Wide front porch, Three interior rooms, Gabled roof, large terracotta roof decorations

### Cerveteri
 - Coastal city, limited rural countryside, sea of immense wealth and power
 - Little farmland, more incentive to be culturally and technologically innovative
 - Associated with spectacular Banditaccia necropolis

### Banditaccia Necropolis
 - Etruscan burial practices were incosistent between regions
	 - General trend from cremation to inhumation
 - Built on a city-like plan, streets, squares, neighbourhoods
 - Thousands of graves, numerous examples of Etruscan art
 - Three different types of tomb: Monumental tumuli, Cube tombs, Underground chambers
 - Most striking: Large earth-covered tumuli, walls of tuff blocks, corbelled/domed ceilings
 - Corridor allows entry towards the tomb area, carved beds, columns, elaborate artwork
 - Underground chambers constructed later than tumuli, most spectacular is Tomb of the Reliefs
 - Sarcophagus of the Spouses
	 - Molded and fired in four separate pieces
	 - Figures depicted contemporary Etruscan fashion, including hairstyle and footwear

### Etruscan Decline
 - Rival economic interests at the end of the 6th century BCE
	 - Cathaginians were pushing the Greeks out of Sicily, Etruscans and Greeks fighting over Cumae
 - Cumae was most northern Greek city, Etruscans wanted exclusive economic rights to this part of the Campanian plain
	 - Etruscans lost in the early 5th century BCE, along with most of their claim to Tyrrhenian commercial supremacy
