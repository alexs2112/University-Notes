# Imperial Society and Economy
### Arretine Ware and Italian Sigillatas (IS)
 - 40 BCE: Arretine ware (sometimes red-gloss), quickly surpassed black-gloss in popularity
	 - Started in Arretium (Arezzo), Mould-formed, very fine relief and applique decorations with diverse forms
 - Reign of Tiberius (14-37 CE): Production of red-gloss expanded outside Arretium and shipped everywhere
	 - From this period on: Typically called Italian (or Terra) Sigillata
	 - Most common form at this time: Very flat footed plates

### Feeding Rome
 - State-subsidized movements of oil, wine, military goods
 - Early Principate: Italy still net exporter of goods
	 - Imported one major product: Grain
	 - Population so large that the city couldn't be fed from its own hinterland
 - 1st Century CE: Increasingly rich through lack of taxation, rise of slavery, revenues of wine and oil
 - 2nd Century CE: Wine and oil from provinces was just as popular and cheaper, fewer military victories = more expensive slaves, production shifted and it was cheaper to import products than buy it at home

### African Red Slip Ware (ARS)
 - Late first century CE, less refined, more orange than red, produced in Tunisia and Algeria
 - Didn't require same delicate firing techniques of Italian Sigillatas
 - Made in huge quantities, variants continue to be the dominant western Roman pottery until 5th-7th century CE
 - Travelling as ballast to Italy, cost subsidized by state-funded grain ships, made pottery so cheap that everybody could afford it
 - Example of Italy becoming a net importer of goods

### Age of the Antonines
 - 100 CE: Italians lived well, prosperity was result of political stability and good economic markeets
	 - No technology developments can explain this growth, just due to social stability and economy
 - Would not last, Military was stalling in Germania and against Parthians (east)
	 - Easy money from looting neighbours through tribute was harder
	 - Provinces were becoming very rich by selling products
	 - Imperial populations increasing, everywhere was better connected by ship and roads
 - **Antonine Plague**:
	 - Poor sanitation, endemic disease load. Life expectancy ~25 years (lots of childhood mortality)
	 - Antonine Plague (aka Plague of Galen) spread through empire from eastern military campaigns
		 - Likely early form of smallpox
	 - End of golden age of the Antonines, after this there is a crisis in military, economic, political stability
	 - Possible spread of Christianity, old gods offered no relief, Christ promised an afterlife

### Death and Burial
 - Very complicated and ritualized funerary practices, celebrate life and accomplishment
 - Late Republic and Principate: Cremation was the norm (some exceptions), had to occur outside city walls
 - Very richest Romans would sometimes get mausolea to house their ashes
 - Small tombs built on roadsides leading into major cities commissioned by families or guilds
 - Even the poorest Romans were cremated, ashes stored in communal columbaria
 - Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker: One of the largest freedman tomb monuments in Rome, looks like baking oven
 - Pyramid Tomb of Cestius: Very strange, Roman politician, resembles Nubian pyramid

### Paleochristian Archaeology
 - Second Century CE: Clear signs of new religion to engulf late Roman world: Christianity
 - Romans tolerated other religions as long as practicioners attended state religious festivals and took part in public sacrificial rites
	 - Christians opposed sacrificial rites, led to periods of persecution in public places like the Colosseum
 - Know of early Christian iconography (fish) in catacombs (rarely in house shrines)
	 - Shrines used in periods of few worshippers, or periods of prosecution

### The Catacombs
 - Many early Christians and Jews cut series of catacombs into soft Roman tufa (2nd century CE)
 - Being buried in a catacomb was desirable to Christians because it placed them alongside martyrs
	 - Many religious services conducted in underground catacombs at this time
 - Tradition continued until 6th century CE, then most martyrs and relics relocated to above ground church cemeteries and basilicas
 - Originally faced with bricks or marbles, then covered over in fresco paintings
 - Valuable as main sources of early Christian artwork from before 400 CE
	 - Many looted of human remains and objects throughout history

### Severan Dynasty
 - Italian political stress after assassination of Commodus
	 - 3 years (1 year with 5 emperors) before Septimius Severus seized power with the Roman army
	 - Power to choose a leader shifting from inherited rights of the senate, to the threat of the army
 - Severan dynasty undertook military operations at the edges of the empire to put down revolts
 - Expanded army substantially, to pay for it he debased the Roman silver standard (80% to ~50%)
	 - Monetary reforms: Huge problem for subsequent emperors
 - Climate of Mediterranean shifting after 200 CE, drought and erosion became more common
	 - Evidence for floods, landslides, earthquakes, famines, small-scale farmers start to disappear
	 - Increasingly risky conditions and inflation due to debasement of the denarius
	 - Poorest farmers sold lands to rich landowners in return for farming rights (just above slavery, colonnate)
	 - Not directly connected, social development appears similar to medieval serfdom

### Roman Economy of Greece
 - First century BCE, Rome gave island of Delos to Athens as a free port
	 - Commercial center became one of the most prosperous in the entire Mediterranean
 - Wealthy Romans benefited from Pax Romana, brought security, maritime traffic, major long-distance roads
 - Key port: Corinth, 85% of amphorae there was imported (other cities have ~50%)
 - Italian red-gloss sigillatas imported into Aegean region in large quantities between 100 BCE to 100 CE
 - Glass blowing (likely invented in Levant around 50 BCE) becomes popular in Greece during Roman period

### Eastern Sigillata
 - Originates from modern Turkey and Syria
 - Red and black-surfaced, begin production in 150 BCE
 - 10 BCE: Production shifts to produce mostly red-surface pottery to copy Roman terra sigillata
	 - Pottery style continued throughout first century CE, gradually replaced by North African pottery
 - Five forms by production location, expert eye to differentiate between Italian sigillata and Eastern sigillata

### Problems with Roman Pottery
 - Most surface pottery found over 150 BCE to 200 CE is broadly dated as "Roman"
	 - Looks like there are more Late Roman sites
 - Nature of ceramic consumption is different, not necessarily depopulation or impoverishment
	 - Maybe people just used less expensive+identifiable pottery
 - Late Roman: Most common artifact on survey is amphora sherds
	 - Using more amphoras in the countryside? Big vessels produce more sherds when they break

### Crisis of the Third Century
 - Empire of Augustus collapses with assassination of last Severan (Severus Alexander) by his own troops (235 CE)
 - Next 50 years feature greatest political, social, economic, military, environmental challenges the empire has seen
	 - At least 24 emperors in this time
 - Causes and outcomes:
	 - No smooth system of succession, when the army realized it could use its power to choose emperors the system convulsed, multiple emperors were named
	 - 249-262: Plague of Cyprian, death count was high, agricultural potential plummeted
	 - Mediterranean climate entered period of unpredictability with numerous famines
	 - Famine in the north caused barbarian groups (Franks, Alemanni, Vandals, Goths) and Persian empire to attack Rome looking for land, wealth, and food
 - Excavation of villa sites in western Greece (Epirus, Patrae) show violent destruction at the end of the third century
	 - Likely due to invading Heruli in 260s
 - 235-284 CE: Roman  Empire almost collapsed into a series of aggressive polities
 - After crisis years: Greece enters Late Roman Period
 - Founding of Constantinople during early fourth century would be transformative for the Aegean world
 - Emperor Aurelian (270-275) reunited the empire, oversaw refortification of Rome with larger curtain walls
	 - First Roman city to have massive walls in late antique style
	 - Over next two centuries, most Italian cities would be fortified in response to growing insecurity of the empire
 - Emperor Diocletian (284-305) would impose sweeping reforms in a bid to save the empire
	 - Successes would have significant repercussions for Italy
		 - Decentralization of economy, landscape reform, monetary reform, administrative reforms
