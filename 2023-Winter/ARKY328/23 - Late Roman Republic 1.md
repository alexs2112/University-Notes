### The Republic at 200 BCE and After
 - 201 BCE: Rome defeated Hannibal in the second Punic War, undisputed power in the Mediterranean
 - After 200 BCE: Italy began experiencing fast imperial economic and interregional territorial expansion
	 - No emperor was crowned, Rome was effectively an empire
 - Around 150 BCE: All Italians, no matter heritage, granted Roman citizenship
	 - Natural progression led to unsuccessful proposal of Gaius Gracchus (154-121 BCE) to grant citizenship to all conquered territories
 - Last century BCE: Series of civil wars, lead to end of Republic constitution and establishment of permanent dictatorship under the emperor

### Army of the Late Republic
 - Republican Rome was a war machine, quickly annexed large territories
 - Army became professional, commanders had long decorated careers to gain more political opportunities
 - Still: Most warfare occurred outside Italy, internal battles left few real archaeological traces
 - Outside Italy: Evidence for Roman warfare is plentiful

### Late Republic Intensification
 - Point: Roman world changing at an unprecedented scale during the Late Republic. Process of Intensification
 - Roman ideals, politics, culture, economics, being spread through military and commercial connections being established all over the Mediterranean
	 - Italy: Growing social complexity + wealth making administrative roles more lucrative
 - Combined with social prestige from warfare created a powder keg situation, shared rule through consuls and senatorial power would inevitably yield to a strong military tyrant

### Being Roman at the End of the Republic
 - Successes and growing complexity of Roman Republic resulted in explosion of social and cultural expressions in associated realms of literature, material culture, elite identity
 - Material culture often used to exemplify Romanitas (Roman-ness), roughly coherent collection of what it meant to be Roman
 - Romanitas tied to various aspects of Hellenistic koine

### Bricolage of Late Republican Society
 - Rather than representing static cultural style, material culture of late Republic shows how Italians display their identity through bricolage of Hellenistic and Roman forms
 - Terrenato: bricolage: complex patchwork made of elements of various ages and provenance
 - Point: Not a static or hybrid material culture of Italian and Greek forms
	 - Seeing an active application of different elements of Roman and Hellenistic koine, changing to suit needs of individuals in particular social or geographical contexts
 - This bricolage managed in social situations by code switching
	 - Must view material culture styles as mix of cultures depending on identity based on situation
	 - No real Roman 'culture' at this point, Romanitas is a tradition in development
 - A Roman could believe in negative stereotypes about Greeks while enjoying Hellenistic art and legends
	 - Saw no contradictions, this is what it meant to be Roman
 - Good example: The act of bathing
	 - Romans not the first to enjoy bathing in hot or cold waters
	 - Advanced bathing by changing it from act of hygiene to one of pleasure, part of daily urban life
	 - Almost certainly learned from the Greeks in Sicily and Southern Italy
		 - Improved and perfected the Greek plans and infrastructure

### Roman City
 - Several ways to theorize a Roman city:
	 - Suite of buildings and infrastructural styles and types that reflect Romanitas
	 - Historically specific services supplied to the surrounding territories
	 - Specific level of demographic density
	 - Specific legal status as municipia, coloniae, or civitates (villages -> vici)
 - Reality: Cities are dynamic places, no one formula

### Late Republican Urbanism
 - 200 BCE: Roman cities show series of common elements derived from aristocratic interests in Hellenistic world, also by new territories conquered by force
 - Late Republic: see Roman cities expand in size, embellishment, number of public buildings
 - 200-175 BCE: Rome sees new structures for official and legal business, roads widened, public spaces paved, wells cleaned, temples fixed with new sculptures, transforming Rome
 - After 175 BCE: Texts show other cities were given these same benefits, some including city walls

### The Basilica
 - Large rectangular multi-functional public space adapted fromt he Stoa Basileios in Athens
 - Originally: Court structures, central naive with two aisles, separated by columns
	 - Did not originate as religious structures, would gain that association
 - First known basilica: Basilica Porcia, build in Roman Forum (184 BCE)
	 - End of second century BCE, basilicas emerging at most Roman towns in forums, essential for urban state

### The Roman Theater
 - Derived from Greek forms, instead of being built into hillsides were free standing and enclosed on all sides
 - Until this point: Performances in makeshift wooden theaters, removed afterwards
	 - Were proud of not having permanent theaters
	 - Trends from other Italian cities, eventually Roman theaters replaced by stone and concrete versions
 - Roman theaters were acoustic marvels, copied and improved on Greek designs
 - Would be a good way to gain political popularity, didnt start out that way
 - **Theater of Pompey**
	 - First permanent theater in Rome, completed in 55 BCE
	 - Instantly ridiculed by aristocracy, thought eastern decadence would weaken Roman values
	 - Made part of a massive complex connecting a monumental garden with the Curia of Pompey, senatorial meeting space (also where Julius Caesar was killed in 44 BCE)
 - **Theater of Balbus**:
	 - 13 BCE, transformational for early medieval studies
	 - After abandoned in late antiquity, reused for settlement in vastly depopulated Rome
	 - Layers of garbage deposits allowed archaeologists to date 7th, 8th century pottery for the first time

### The Aqueduct
 - Highly symbolic of quick urbanization over the late Republic, mastery of Rome over the environment
 - Water drawn into cities to supply public baths, fountains, latrines, some private residences, mines, mills, farms
 - Aqueducs relied on gravity, waterproof cement, sedimentation sluices, architectural knowledge of the arch
 - First aqueduct built in Rome in 312 BCE (Aqua Appia) with another four by the end of the period

### Limits of Expansion
 - Italians became richer over second and first centuries BCE, housing spaces in urban centers highly desirable
 - Cosa: housing plan breaks down against market forces, rear gardens repurposed as smaller houses
 - Pompeii: Houses became extremely elaborate and enormous over second century BCE
 - Rome: Domestic structures expand significantly, rich owners muscled out lesser owners, razed their houses to expand their own
	 - Cicero: His rival, Clodius, forced him into exile, destroyed his house, built a temple over it
	 - Most prestigious houses lined the Via Sacra, Rome's main ceremonial route through the Forum

### The Peristyle Garden
 - New architectural form, use of extensive colonnaded peristyle appears in Italy after contact with Greece
	 - Hellenistic feature, way it was used in Italy was entirely Roman
 - Increased avenues for social competition, new rooms added to the atrium house design
 - Peristyle used to support domestic rituals and bolster political careers, very different from the private spaces of Greek houses
	 - No andron or evidence of gender divisions
	 - Oeci and exedrae used for reception, not private activitiess
