### Archaeology and Annales
 - Annales perspective to describe the Bronze Age Collapse
 - Most famous annales historian is Ferdinand Braudel, framework on 3 different scales:
	 - Longue Duree: Long, slow, almost imperceptible changes of environments and societies
	 - Conjonctures: Medium term of history, cyclical rhythms of rise and fall
	 - Evenements: Lives of individuals and history of events

### What is a Dark Age
 - Renaissance concept to describe lack of writing in post-Roman Europe
	 - No archaeological investigations, lack of writing created a dark spot in historic chronologies
	 - Assumed nothing  much happened, people reduced to state of barbarism
 - Cyclicity of the rise and fall of empires is all-pervasive in historical consciousness
 - Example: Thomas Cole's painting series, The Course of Empire (1833-1836)

### Ubiquity of Regeneration
 - Few societies collapse completely, in almost every case a collapse event is followed by a long regeneration phase
|Trends during Collapse|Trends during Regeneration|
|---|---|
|Social fission|Nucleation and regionalisation|
|Economic simplicity|Rebuilding of trade relationships and wealth|
|Artistic simplicity|Rediscovery of complex styles in pottery and metalwork|
|Depopulation|Slow repopulation|
|Settlement and infrastructural abandonment|Settlements might emerge in new areas|
|Administrative simplicity|Relatively quick reestablishment of power on smaller scale|
|Continuation of religious beliefs|Burial practices undergo transformation|
|Simplification in landscape exploitation|Landscape relationships start local, grow w/ economy|

### Early Iron Age (EIA) Overview
 - Protogeometric: Iron technology arrives in Greece, likely from Cyprus, around 1050 BCE
 - Early Geometric: Prolonged phase of dislocation of social complexity in the southern Aegean after Bronze Age Collapse
 - Middle Geometric: Society best described as small competing cheifdoms, large settlements progressively absorbing smaller ones
 - Late Geometric: Burst of social complexity, 750 BCE, population increase, economic expansion, growing wealth, new alphabet

### Spread of Iron
 - Diffused from Hittite empire after its fall
 - More geologically plentiful than copper and tin, harder to extract
	 - First smelted, hammered to remove impurities, then reworked into other shapes
 - Diffusion of iron was sow in Europe, faster in Greece & Italy. Likely elites were getting forged weapons as gifts and were unable to make them locally for several generations

### Making Iron
 - Abundant in Europe
 - Smelted: Purification process, most of iron age was a small scale operation
	 - Hole dug in the ground, clay cylinder built with an access hole for bellows
 - Furnace loaded with alternating layers of charcoal, iron ore, flux like limestone to attract metals away from the iron
 - Result: Iron bloom, furnace broken apart and the bloom extracted from the bottom. Reheated and any leftover impurities or slags were hammered off
 - Result: Wrought iron bar, could then be reheated and forged into other implements
	 - Some smiths already knew how to alloy iron with carbon to produce steel from the beginning of the Iron Age

### Evidence for EIA Society
 - Administrative centers gone, interregional economics appear to have disappeared
	 - Linear B is redundant (administrative language)
	 - Literacy disappears for 4 centuries, oral histories continue
 - Only Linear script surviving to now: Cypriot Syllabary, descended from Linear A and continued at least until Hellenistic period
 - Most of what we know from this time comes from burials and grave goods
	 - Demonstrate every region of Greece has different social and cultural structures in this period
 - Singular "Dark Age" to cover all of Greece is a simplification

### EIA Society Overview
 - Unity of Greek society disappeared with the collapse of Mycenae
 - Many folk-movements, large scale migrations of Aegean peoples
	 - Attempts to escape violence and unpredictability
	 - Rejects the "invasion model" of Dorian Greeks
	 - Evidence shows a slow diffusion of eastern Greek material culture in a system rooted in Mycenaean-Minoan legacy

### Post-Mycenaean Landscape
 - Palaces destroyed, landscape experiences generalized site abandonments, depopulation, likely famine
 - Many towns and villages disappear, settlements are thinly settled patchwork of close spaced hamlets focused arounda defendable high point (acropolis)
 - Landscape deeply fractured by series of independent regions organized by oikoi, farming households organized by kinship
	 - Oikos: Early precursor to the poleis, Greek city-state model
 - Rulers of these small groups were called basileus, Mycenaean word for chieftain
	 - Likely warrior elites seeing virtue in aggression and feuding
 - Most successful EIA town is Athens, first to achieve regional dominance before the end of the GEometric period
	 - Other successful towns: Thebes, Argos, Knossos, particular toward the end of the period toward the Archaic period

### Northern Greece
 - Doesn't suffer the Bronze Age Collapse as badly as the southern mainland, less connected to Mycenaean world
 - Across LH, EIA, northern Greece experience little disruption on slow accumulation of social complexity
 - Lack of disruption meant these territories continued on trajectory rooted in Bronze Age and rule through kingship
 - Archaic and Classical periods: Northern Greece ruled by traditional monarchies, the south is ruled by different types of democracies

### Age of Homer
 - Late Geometric period time of Homer and Hesiod
	 - Development at the end of this period of "Historical Archaeology", using texts to help interpret material record
 - Homer's Iliad and Odyssey detailed events from the late Mycenaean period, 300-400 years before he was bron
	 - Archaeology of EIA suggests him using his own contemporary late 8th century BCE social norms
 - At face value, could easily misunderstand the social organization of the Mycenaean period. In reality, tells us more about late Geometric times

### EIA Pottery: The Geometric Turn
 - Fanciful figurative decoration of Mycenaean pottery mostly disappear after 1100 BCE, replaced with simpler designs in geometric styles
 - Demand for communicative art was low, likely geometric designs had meanings
	 - Perhaps meant to mimic textile patterning, or building constructions
 - Resulting patterning maintains a pleasing symmetry
 - Nearly all complete examples comes from burial contets, large scale diffusion is likely because of intermarriage, migration, trade between dispersed communities
