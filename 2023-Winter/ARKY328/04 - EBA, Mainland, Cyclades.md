### Overview
1. Birth phase of Aegean Civilization, tendency toward regionalization (EBA 1)
2. Proto-urbanization (EBA 1 and 2)
3. Proliferation of Mediterranean triad of crops: Grain, Olives, Grapes (EBA 1)
4. Spread of donkey to help with transport
5. Bronze Metallurgy
6. Expansion of trade, social connections within the Aegean, beyong
7. Ramping up of complex societies (climate phase from EBA 2)
8. Decline in sites in EBA 3 phase, controversial & debated

### Bronze
 - Metal technology of the EBA was more sophisticated than the copper production of the Final Neolithic (Chalcolithic)
 - Bronze is an alley, copper + arsenic, later copper + tin (arsenic is poisonous)
	 - Melts at lower temp than copper, easier to cast and harder metal
 - Copper, gold, silver available locally in Aegean, tin and arsenic had no sources and needed to be traded for. Bronze manufacture was only possible in Aegean due to interregional trade and communication
	 - Most likely by donkey transport rather than boat

### Early Helladic Culture Sequence
 - Approximately 1000-year long experiment in social complexity
 - Pottery cultures, different types of pottery that is convenient for dividing up time
 - First excavations include Carl Blegen's work at Korakou near Corinth (1916-1918), not until work at Lerna in 1950s that the EH culture sequence was established
 - Most EH archaeology is known from settlements vs burials
 - Period saw the development of chiefdoms in the Aegean
|Culture|Period|
|---|---|
|Eutresis Culture|EH I (c. 3200-2650 BCE)|
|Korakou Culture|EH II (c. 2650-2200 BCE)|
|Tiryns Culture|EH III (c. 2200-2000 BCE)|

### Eutresis Culture
 - Earliest coherent mainland culture following the Neolithic was defined at the site of Eutresis in Boeotia
 - Main pottery types: Unslipped and burnished, red-slipped and burnished, some examples have incised lines
	 - Increasing numbers of kiln finds suggest pottery craft specialization was increasing
 - Settlement numbers increased and many are located over Neolithic sites, more coastal sites and occupation of lower hills rather than inland mountains
	 - Shift from pastoralism toward agriculture
 - Textiles were important, fabric impressions on ceramics, lots of spindle whorls from the site of Tsoungiza
 - Metal was rare in this period, cultural and trade relations outside region were increasing but not yet significant

### EH I - II Exchange Networks
 - EBA exchange networks were widening, compared to early Neolithic and extensive exchange networks exist from EH I
 - Epirus in NW Greece, site of Doliana contained pottery assemblage with large storage jars, slipped and polished bowles with incised lips.
	 - Look like EH I and II sites from the south rather than the north
 - Bratislava lid fragment shows that the site was connected with Moravia, Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Thessaly, even Africa
	 - Less evidence for eastern connections at this time

### Korakou Culture
 - Period of cultural, social innovation
	 - Monumental architecture, metallurgy, wealth disparity
	 - Site of Lerna is the most famous
 - Surveys show that sie numbers increase over EH II, not as fast as EH I
	 - Site hierarchies in the landscape
 - Clay figurines from Tsoungiza coupled with site expansion into deep upland soils suggest that yoked oxen were used to help ploughing at this time
 - Pottery include glazed wares, dark-painted ware, yellow mottled ware/light-painted fine-polished ware.
	 - Sauceboat form is popular during EH IIA
 - EH IIA saw general cultural innovations, EH IIB saw development of corridor houses and influx of eastern influences in pottery styles from the Cyclades
 - **Settlement**: Lithares in Boeotia, central Greece, revealed sprawling late EH I and EH IIA village
	 - Streets, housing blocks likely organized by a guiding authority
	 - Streets were rare around this time
 - EH IIB: Fortifications
	 -  Built at even the smallest EH II B settlements, particularly on coastal sites
	 - Cultural reasons, or constant threat?
		 - Likely most settlements were engaged in internal competition
	 - Walls at Lerna were built and rebuilt several times
		 - Different from sites like Troy II, Lerna fortifications had two walls separated by small rooms
 - EH IIB: Corridor Houses
	 - Domestic architecture, found all over Helladic mainland, characterised by rectangular structures with narrow corridor spaces along their exteriors
	 - Most famous is the multi-story "House of the Tiles" at Lerna, named for dense scatter of stone and ceramic roof tiles discovered during excavation
		 - Elite residence, perhaps the house of chief ruling 50-110 households (one per seal)
		 - Place of communal gathering and storage
		 - Burned down at the end of EH II, violent end
	 - Deposit of over 70 sealings (lumps of clay impressed by a seal, signature) demonstrated aspects of social complexity and economy previously unknown for the EH period
		 - Tax collection, proto-bureaucracy

### EH II-III Exchange Networks
 - Widening exchange networks maintained into EH III
 - Site of Helike in Achaea, coastal site with much late EH II Lefkandi I pottery, also had EH II-III depas amphikypellon (Depas cup) from Anatolia
	 - Link the Peloponnese with the Near East
 - Upland valleys of Arcadia, seemingly remote site of Asea Paleokastro include many non-local artifacts
 - Both sites were central places on a regional exchange network taking advantage of sea transport, travel through interior river valleys

### Tiryns Culture
 - Significant event happened over EH II and III periods (c 2200)
	 - Previous scholars suggest invasion by easterners
	 - Now we believe people were on the move, settling rather than invading, as they fled political collapse in Mesopotamia
	 - May have had an environmental trigger, drier and agriculture was failing
 - Short EH III phase is hard to identify archaeologically
 - Pottery is a form of degenerated glazed ware, dark-on-light ware, yellow mottled ware, more plain wares than previously
	 - Pattern painted surfaces become more common, as do wheel-thrown ceramics
 - EH III: Apsidal Houses
	 - Smaller and unfortified compared to EH II
	 - Thought these were built by an invading culture in Lerna
	 - Apsidal houes found at Tiryns, Epidauros were dated to late EH II, suggesting these people moved to Lerna after the House of the Tiles burned down

### Tumulus Burials
 - Tumulus: earthen mound constructed over a sacred spot
	 - Cist graves, boxes made from marble slabs used to inter multiple family members
	 - Most common in EH I and II, over EH III tumuli increasingly appear
 - At Olympia, tumulus tomb called the Pelopeion had a EH III date, so does a tumulus in Nidhri of Lefkas
 - Not all tumuli commemorate the deceased
	 - Tumulus built encompassing the House of Tiles after it burnt down, no human remains
	 - People continued living on the site in a much reduced state
	 - Tumuli remain part of Greek burial ritual for hundreds of years

### EH III Crisis
 - Greek mainland increasing its connections with wider Mediterranean, Europe over the EBA, ended c. 2200 BCE
 - Evidence of violent destruction at Lerna appears at other mainland sites, EH III period is comparitively depopulated
	 - Even MH I growth appears sluggish
 - Unlikely to be foreign invasion, most sites show destruction at different times throughout EH II, III
	 - Cultural changes were gradual, not sudden as an invasion would dictate
 - Most likely due to worsening climate and political instability in the east

### Early Cycladic Culture Sequence
 - No convenient mythical label, represent "linear upward progress toward civilization, punctuated by periodic impact of outside influence, invasion, attack"
 - Islands famous for producing Early Bronze Age marble figurines
 - Cultures follow Crete and the mainland in sequencing (EC I, II, III)
	 - Individual islands, island groups have their own distinctive cultures, overlap or absent in different islands
	 - Island interaction zones based on sailing radii
 - EC I settlements are poorly known, likely dispersed individual family farmstead with some farming and some fishing
	 - Centralized settlements appear from EC II, usually one town per island
	 - EM Knossos probably had similar population to all the EC islands combined
 - Most archaeological data for this period come from burials, pottery typologies informing relative chronologies
	 - Human remains provide calendrical date ranges thanks to radiocarbon dating
|Culture|Time Period|Settlements|
|---|---|---|
|The Grotta-Pelos Culture|EC I (c. 3400-3000 BCE)|Milos, Paros, Antiparos, Dhespotikon, Naxos, Siphnos|
|The Kampos Group|EC I – II (c. 3000-2800 BCE)|Paros, Ano Kouphonisi, Amorgos|
|The Keros-Syros Culture|EC II (c. 2800-2300 BCE)|Syros, Keros, Dhaskalio, Amorgos, Naxos, Milos|
|The Kastri Group|EC II – III (c. 2500-2200 BCE)|Syros, Amorgos, Kea|
|The Phylakopi I Culture|EC III (c. 2200-1900 BCE)|Milos, Paros|

### Grotta-Pelos Culture
 - Cist graves
	 - Grave goods include dark pottery, incised herringbone decoration, obsidian blades, marble vessels including bowls, beakers, jars (kandiles)
 - Marble figures, mostly female, are schematic but some have simple forms (Louros type) and complex forms (Plastiras type)
	 - Violin-shaped figurines are also known

### Kampos Group
 - Identified from cemeteries on Paro, Ano Kouphonisi and a small settlement on Amorgos
 - Grave goods include ceramic frying pans (bases of mirrors? rituals?), bottles, footed bowls
 - Cemetery of Haghia Phota, port of Pros-Kastambas on northern Crete share these stylistic assemblages, settlers from the Cyclades may have migrated to Crete at this time

### Keros-Syros Culture
 - Named for settlement and cemetery at Chalandriana on Syros, ritual deposit at Kavos on Keros
	 - Many subsequent examples have been identified
 - Known for its sophisticated marble vessels, celebrated folded-arm sculptures and statues
 - Time for increasing prosperity and social complexity
 - Cemeteries also include fine painted ceramics, marble vessels, frying pans (as above), copper daggers
 - Settlements are known from this time, small face-to-face villages
	 - Skarkos is the most celebrated
	 - Sites on the Peloponnese and Anatolia share EC II material culture styles, speaking to an international spirit
 - Golden age of Cycladic civilization
	 - Cereal crops supplemented by olives and vines, small [todo]

### Kastri Group
 - Named for fortified settlement of Kastri on Syros, another foritifed settlement appears on Naxos
	 - Likely large (over 500 people) and constantly at war with each other due to narrow ranges of ecological resources on individual islands
 - Culture is a continuation of the Keros-Syros culture, builds on its international connections
 - Pottery styles from Anatolia, wheel-made plates and two handled depas cups appear in the Cyclades at this time
	 - Arsenic bronze in the Cyclades is also replaced by tin bronze

### Phylakopi I Culture
 - Named for site of Phylakopi on Milos, also appears on Paros
 - Period of disruption, settlements in the Cyclades appear to nucleate and decline significantly in number over EC III, after the First City is destroyed at the end of EC II, Phylakopi is reoccupied, increasing importance
 - Pottery appears dark with incisions, common form is the duck-vase
 - Marble figurines become simple in design
 - [todo]

### Last Words on EC
 - Unique Cycladic cultures, identifiable material cultures and fortified settlements would not developinto larger-scale civilizations
 - Remained small face-to-face villages thanks to limited ecological profiles, essential maritime trade networks, intercommuna warfare
 - Still supported elite families judging by socially differentiated material culture
 - In the MBA, LBA, Cyclades would be dominated by the Minoans from Crete, and then the Myceneans from the mainland
 - From this point forward, the Cyclades would be important for trade and exchange, would not develop a comparable civilization to the Minoans or Myceneans

### End of the EBA, Coming of the Greeks?
 - Don't know what cuased the EBA II crisis, appearance of new features like apsidal houses and tumuli was evidence of a new group moving into the region
 - Know now that these attributes appeared on the mainland in different places and different times throughout the FN to MH periods
 - Also true for Crete and Cyclades, more continuity between the EBA III and MBA I than EBA II and III on most sites
	 - Lerna excavations were essential to this discovery
 - Clear cultural break at the end of EBA II is believed to have resulted from severe drought in the east, climatic land degradation, destruction due to social unrest, all occurring variously over EBA III
 - Ceramic sequences don't always equate to historical periods or defined cultures
