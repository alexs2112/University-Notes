### Archaeological Methods
 - Primary scales: Artifact, Site, Landscape, used to represent the Archaeological record
 - Terminus post quem: The earliest possible date of a deposit or site
 - Terminus ante quem: The latest possible date of a deposit or site

### Environment
 - Really hot and dry summers, cool and wet winters. Subtropical high pressure zone
 - Much of central, northern areas are forested, LBA periods are associated w/ mass deforestation
 - Dense, tough shrubs to survive frequent droughts, very difficult to travel through and find artifacts
 - Mediterrannean Trinity: Grain, Olives, Grapes, olive trees slowly distributed from trade

### EBA Mainland, Cyclades
 - Bronze is an alloy of copper and arsenic, later copper and tin (arsenic is toxic)
 - Tin and arsenic had no local sources, needed to be traded for, bronze production only possible due to interregional trade and communication
 - Eutresis Culture (EH I): Earliest coherent mainland culture following the Neolithic
	 - Shift from pastoralism towards agriculture (inland mountains -> coastal sites, lower hills)
	 - Textiles were important with fabric impressions on ceramics
	 - Metal was rare in this period, cultural and trade relations were increasing but not significant
 - Korakou Culture (EH II): Period of cultural, social innovation (Lerna is most famous site)
	 - Oxen were used to help ploughing in this time
	 - Lithares, Boetia: Streets and housing blocks (organized by guiding authority), streets were rare in this period
	 - Fortifications built at even the smallest settlements, particularly coastal sites. Walls at Lerna destroyed several times
	 - Corridor houses: Most famous is multi-story House of the TIles at Lerna (elite residence, communal gathering place, burned down at end of EH II)
		 - Deposit of over 70 sealings (lumps of clay impressed by seal), social complexity and economy
 - Tiryns Culture (EH III): People migrating elsewhere, fleeing political collapse, may be due to environment
	 - Apsidal Houses: Smaller and unfortified compared to EH II
 - Tumulus Burials: Earthen mound constructed over sacred spot, not all tumuli commemorate the deceased (house of tiles)
 - Grotta-Pelos Culture (EC I): Cist graves with grae goods. Simple female marble figures (violin-shaped)
 - Kampos Group (EC I - II): Cemetery of Haghia Phota, port of Pros-Kastambas share stylistic assemblages, settlers from the Cyclades may have migrated to Crete at this time
	 - Ceramic "frying pans" (bases of mirrors? rituals?)
 - Keros-Syros Culture (EC II): Sophisticated marble vessels, celebrated folded-arm sculptures and statues
	 - Increasing prosperity and social complexity
	 - Settlements as small f2f villages, Skarkos is most celebrated
	 - Golden age of Cycladic civilization
 - Kastri Group (EC II - III): Fortified settlement of Kastri on Syros, likely large with constant war due to narrow range of ecological resources on individual islands
	 - Arsenic bronze replaced by tin bronze
 - Phylakopi I Culture: (EC III): Period of disruption, settlements in Cyclades appear to nucleate and decline significantly
	 - Marble figurines become simple in design

### EBA, MBA Aegean, Minoan
 - EM Settlement, Urbanism: End of Neolithic, 3 types of settlements in Crete: Agricultural sites in productive hinterlands, Trading sites on the coast, Marginal sites
 - By EM II, most marginal sites were abandoned, agricultural sites expand, settlements begin to look like early cities (proto urbanism)
 - Proto-Palatial Central Palaces: MM courts (open spaces in palaces) built, used for large scale communal rituals
	 - EM I pottery is large vessels, eating+drinking from same bowls. By EM IIA they shrink, social hierarchies become more complex beyond household groups
 - EM Production: New and more complicated ceramic wares, start of specialists, wares for markets
	 - Coastal sites were large cneters of exchange, smaller coastal sites proure obsidian, metal, stone
 - EM Burial: New forms of burial reflect increasing social competition
	 - Find conspicuous consumption items in lavish grave goods
	 - Grave goods also include items for body maintenance
 - EM Writing: Administrative seals in EM II, emergence of elite identities and cultures, no good evidence for writing in EM
 - Not period of social equality, competing for status, developing elite identities
 - Middle Minoan Period: Crete sees quick recovery after EBA III crisis, true palaces begin to appear in MM IB
 - Protopalaces: functional locations, may not have residents full time, ritual centers and storage facilities
 - MM Material Culture: Dominated by Kamares pottery, thin due to diffusion of fast potters wheel. Designs of abstract flowers, curvilinear marine motifes
 - MM Writing: Cretan hieroglyphs, Linear A
 - End of the first palaces: Knossos, Malia, Phaistos. Likely due to earthquakes

### Middle Bronze Age
 - Landscape after EBA III Crisis: Depopulation, destruction of sites, changes to settlement hierarchy, changes to burial and material culture
 - Settlement pattern: Small sites abandoned by MH I, remaining ones decreased, world of villages
	 - By MH III: Sites increase, land use becomes more intensive, sites reoccupied
 - Domestic Architecture: organization becomes more organized and socially differentiated
 - MH I-II Burial: Happening within settlements, tumuli and tholoi used sporadically, mostly individual graves
 - MH I-II Social Organization: Agriculture villages, domestic crafts, chamber tombs for common people with richer tombs for elites
 - Shaft burials: Deep shaft, corpse box at bottom plus riches, refill shaft with dirt and marked with stone slab
 - MH III Burial: Extramural cemeteries more popular, shaft graves + chamber tombs, more opulent grave goods
 - MH Material Culture: Tin bronze over arsenic bronze, nearly all ceramics done on a wheel
 - MC Settlement: Mostly large townships, fortification continues, Phylakopi on Melos is most important

### Early, Middle Bronze Age Italy
 - General Chronology: Early Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age 1-3, Recent/Late Bronze Age, Final Bronze Age
 - Bell Beaker culture: known for expert use of bronze and gold, archery w/ new stone, metal arrowheads
	 - Cord-impressed drinking cups, not all for drinking, not all cord-impressed but still distinctive shape
 - Polada Culture: Rooted in bell beaker tradition, built houses on wooden stilts above peat bogs
 - MBA Terramare: Discovery by nutrient rich sediment quarried for fertilizer
	 - Pile-dwelling villages like polada, settlements built on small lakes with perimeter moat
	 - First group to bring entire Italian peninsula into single economic sphere by RBA
	 - When fields dried up and food was scarce they fissioned and migrated away
 - Bronze Age Sardinia: Nuragic culture, very advanced out of Beaker, Bonnanaro cultures in EBA
 - Nuraghi: Famous in Sardinia, defensive towers built in truncated cone shaped. During L/FBA they develop into large complexes of stone towers with curtain walls, sacred springs for sacredness of water
 - Apennine Culture: in MBA, semi-nomadic herders, small defensible hamlets in winter, coastal plains in summer. in RBA turn into agricultural settlements focused on stock raising, abandon coastal areas
	 - Linu Sul Mignone: Excavations revealing portable hearths and hand mills, permamently settled people

### Mycenaeans
 - LBA Crete: MM/LM sees palaces rebuilt after earthquakes of MM, now seats of elites
 - Second/New Palace Period: High settlement density w/ oxen ploughs, palaces begin to exert control
 - Theran Eruption: LM IA-IB period
 - LBA Cyclades: Minoan acculteration until Theran eruption, then Mycenaean takeover
 - Akrotiri, Thera (Santorini): Bronze Age Pompeii, perfectly preserved
	 - Xeste 3: Rites of passage for young girls. West House: Elite mansion to produce textiles
 - Settlements: Share characteristics: Palatial center, Commanding position (fortified), Water + good agricultural land, Situated at lanes of communication between sea + interior
 - Burials: Shaft graves reach peak occurrence & opulence, contain more people, increasing importance of lineage. Diversity of tomb types indicate levels of social competition
 - LM II-III: Post-Palatial Crete, Knossos ruled over Crete under mainland Mycenaean control
 - Destruction of Knossos: Two different explanations depending on date:
	 - 13th-12th century BCE: Part of Bronze Age Collapse
	 - If LM IIIA, early 14th century BCE: Local Cretans rose up against their Helladic conquerors
 - Material Culture: Influenced by Minoan styles, high quality, mass produced, exported all over Mediterranean. Exports of food & textiles are minimal, consumed where it was created

### Bronze Age Collapse
 - Institutionalization of power of LH III: Represented by Mycenaean palaces, New burial practices, Linear B
 - Mycenaean LH III Palaces: Craft production and food storage, also seats of Kings, possible Queens
 - Mycenaean LH III Graves: Most common people buried in rock-cut chamber tombs, few tholos tombs outside Mycenae. Near Mycenae: Treasure of Atreas tomb (Tomb of Agamemnon)
 - Linear B: Examples from unfired clay from Knossos, describe admin system, landowners pay taxes which are used to establish trade relationships
 - End of Mycenaean Palaces: Social system is strained, complex administration collapses
 - Postpalatial Period of LH IIIC: All palaces are destroyed, Linear B, luxury crafts, frescos all disappear, social instability & organizational collapse all over. Massive depopulation
 - Collapse: Unlikely to be internal warfare and invasion, fall of Hittites and sea peoples (raiders). Most likely to be disruption coinciding with internal strife and climatic trigger
	 - Network of power collapsed, food production plummeted, populations decreased
 - Proto-Villanovans: Last phase of Apennine culture, continue to settle on defensible hilltops, agro-pastoralism, develop into Villanovans
 - Villanovans: Cremation became widespread in Italy throughout FBA, different parts of Italy begin to develop stronger regional variations, significant transformation w/ iron, emergence of Italian Peoples
	 - No Italian collapse, simpler society not subject to same stressors as Mycenaeans and Hittites
