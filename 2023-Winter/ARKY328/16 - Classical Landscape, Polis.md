### Political Power at the end of the Archaic
 - Central and Southern Aegean: Polis (city state) dominated settlement hierarchies
	 - Supported by extensive agricultural hinterland (chora)
	 - Half adult male populations of these settlements (full citizens) shared power with aristocratic elite, much internal conflict
	 - Sparta was unique, 2 royal dynasties, council of elders (ephors) and larger citizen body of middle-class men (Spartiates)
 - Northern Aegean: Ethnos (tribal states) continued to dominate
	 - Political control based on ethne, various combinations of dynastic chiefs, or federations of people
	 - Tribal or federal organization, power resided in single elite or king
	 - More common in mountainousregions and northern Greece
 - Lawcourts (prytaneia) and civic council assembly halls (bouleuteria) appear in cities end of period
	 - Symbolic center for democratic polis
	 - Only archaeological signs of this political shift

### Survey and Demography
 - Huge population increase during Classical period
 - Peripheral regions increasingly emulate the core by enhancing their militarism, urbanism, investments in status monuments
 - Ancient sources regarding population are inconsistent and inaccurate
 - Landscape Survey: Walking over landscapes to search for artifacts (usually freshly ploughed)
	 - Sometimes only hints of sites are found
	 - Often scattered artifacts all over the Mediterranean
	 - Surveys can be redone as new fields are ploughed or reploughed, can reveal new sites

### Athens
 - Wider democratic institutions because they paid public servants, lowest social class of many slaves
	 - Reliance on slavery and surplus wealth freed the population to think about politics, philosophy, physical training, arts
 - Extra layer of political complexity that was undemocratic
	 - Used military power to subjugate nearby poleis, extract tribute
	 - Imperial style of government

### The Delian League
 - 478 BCE, Athenians formed the Delian League
	 - Group of allies like a maritime empire
	 - Athens extracting tribute for protection and avoiding military consequences
 - In addition to tribute, Athens had:
	 - Rich agricultural chora
	 - Access to silver mines
	 - Exported of olive oil
	 - Military ventures to secure other resources around the Mediterranean
 - Allowed general and statesman Pericles to restore the Acropolis on a massive scale (450 BCE)
	 - Four key monuments: Propylaea gate complex, the Parthenon, the Temple of Athena Polias, the Temple of Athena Nike

### Organization of the Classical Landscape
 - Dominated by nucleated settlements, most sites originally settled in Archaic times
	 - Small farms -> hamlets
	 - Small villages -> small poleis
 - Poleis controlled vast agricultural hinterlands, Athens grew to control surrounding settlements
	 - Smaller urban cores and territories (demes) were organized to be self-sufficient and to produce surplus to be sent to Athens as tribute

### The Attic Landscape
 - End of Archaic, reforms of Cleisthenes saw Attica further divided into three zones:
	 - Asty (urban), Mesogeia (inland), Paralia (coast)
 - Demes located in the three zones were organized into 30 groups called trittyes, 10 trittyes per zone
	 - Each trittye was assigned a tribe (phylai) in a way so that most tribes had at least one coastal, one inland, one urban territory, which were non contiguous
 - Reorganization designed to distribute landed resources more evenly to territories with somewhat even populations
 - The polis Boule (city council) was reorganized so that it had exactly 500 members, each tribe supplying 50 people
 - 2/3 to 4/5 of the population lived in  nucleated settlements, the remaining likely lived in farms or farm clusters. Most permanent, few temporary

### Key Classical Landscape Studies and Results
 - **The Atene Survey**: Suggests area near Athens supported rich landowners involved in olive cash cropping during the Classical era
 - **The Kea Project**: Island survey suggests much of the Classical landscape might be destroyed, especially once-ubiquitous agricultural terraces
 - **The Pylos and Laconia Surveys**: Vast area controlled by Sparta mostly inhabited by helot-serfs and free communities with limited rights (perioeci)
	 - Nearby Laconia has many sites, Spartan citizens owned rural estates, serfs farmed them
	 - Helots lived in nucleated villages as they were not directly controlled
 - **The Boeotia Survey**: Dense population implied by Classical sources may be accurate if poorer peasants supplemented their smallholdings with labour on larger estates
	 - Otherwise their lands were insufficient for a single family
 - These surveys show taht the family farms from Archaic reach highest numbers in Classical and Hellenistic, almost all disappear by late Hellenistic and early Roman
 - Pottery evidence is most importance
	 - Majority of Classical period pottery is domestic course wares (not fine red-figure pottery)

### Peloponnesian Wars
 - Series of battles between Spartaand Athens from450s, more frequently from 432
 - Plague hit Athens in 430 -> stricter laws and plummeting agricultural production
 - Spartans invaded every year to destroy towns and burn crops, forcing Athenians to buy grain overseas
	 - Would end naval attacks around the Peloponnese to do the same
	 - Even Sicily brought into the war
 - By 413 BCE, Spartans had taken all land around Athens, only protected by its Long Walls
 - Last phase of the war, Spartans built a navy, blocked Athenian supply lines forcing a surrender
 - Long Walls dismantled in 404 BCE, rebuilt in 395 BCE after overthrowing Spartan government
	 - Athens would try but fail to regain its political position

### The Plague of Athens
 - 430 BCE, killed 75-100k people, 1/4 of the population
	 - Including Pericles, Athenian general
	 - Plague returned in 429 and 427 BCE
 - Extremely contagious, Athens already a breeding ground for disease due to their reliance on the long walls for defense against Sparta
 - Thucydides contracted it, describes it coming Ethiopia -> Egypt -> Athens
	 - Writes that the plague caused the decline of morals, religion, rule of law
	 - Nobody willing to care for the sick out of fear
	 - Bodies piled on the streets, mass graves
	 - Many symptoms, many possible diseases theorized to cause the plague
		 - Bubonic plague, typhus, smallpox, measles, hemorrhagic fever (ebola)
	 - Likely caused by multiple contagions, perhaps something that no longer exists
 - Mass graves are uncommon in antiquity, most cultures have ritualized styles of burial, throwing bodies randomly into a pit is particularly uncommon for the Greeks
 - DNA analysis suggests typhoid fever, could be corrupted sample by salmonella

### Rise of the Macedonians
 - Athens tried to revive its maritime empire, rising strength of Thebes in 370-360 prevented that
 - Newpower in 338 BCE: Kingdom of Macedon from northern Greece
	 - Subjugated every Greek statee xcept for Sparta
	 - When the king, Philip II, was assissinated in 336 BCE, Alexander (son) suppressed the rebellious city-states (specifically Thebes) and brought the Macedon war machine to the Persian Empire
		 - Conquered lands east until his death in 323 BCE in Babylon
