### Early Iron Age (EIA) Overview
 - Protogeometric: Iron technology arrives in Greece, likely from Cyprus, around 1050 BCE
 - Early Geometric: Prolonged phase of dislocation of social complexity in the southern Aegean after Bronze Age Collapse
 - Middle Geometric: Society best described as small competing cheifdoms, large settlements progressively absorbing smaller ones
 - Late Geometric: Burst of social complexity, 750 BCE, population increase, economic expansion, growing wealth, new alphabet

### Protogeometric (1050-900 BCE)
 - Pottery uses many of the same forms as LH
 - Paints include horizontal decorative bands, compass-drawn circles, mostly on the shoulder of the vessel
 - Amphorae become common in this period
 - Late Protogeometric period, Greek pottery is once again shipped outside the Aegean to the eastern and central Mediterranean

### Early Geometric (900-850 BCE)
 - Designs are far more intricate, circles are minimized in focus
 - Much of the ceramic is covered in black glaze, decorative panels on neck, shoulder, body
 - Vessels also somewhat grow in size

### Middle Geometric (850-760 BCE)
 - Designs see decorative zones multiply
 - Also coated in black glaze, some have horses or water birds illustrated (rarely people)

### Late Geometric (760-700 BCE)
 - Geometric designs are maintained, figural art returns more regularly to cceramic decorations
 - Amphorae, Kraters become enormous, some made to stand as grave markers
 - At the end of the period, design rules relax, geometric designs appear on secondary zones of vessels and pictoral scenes become the focus

### EIA Burial
 - Most of the knowledge comes from burial contexts and recovered pottery
 - Earlier: Burial cultures were varied, suggest societies were local but culturally distinct
 - Geometric cremations: Men buried in neck-handled amphorae, women were buried in belly-handled forms (not always)
 - Morris (1987, 2000) demonstrated traditional understandings of EIA cemeteries were misleading population reconstructions
	 - Population dynamics: Demonstrated earlier LH IIIC cemeteries, later archaic cemeteries demonstrated social inclusiveness, nearly everyone was buried
	 - EIA not so inclusive, 1050-760 BCE burial only appears for privileged male elite (besides **Rich Athenian Lady**)
	 - Demonstrates population decline occcurred, not as dramatic as previously believed

### Bronze Tripod Cauldrons
 - Metallurgy at EIA Lefkandi, artisan craftworkers retained knowledge from Mycenaean world
 - Produced gold jewelry, distinctive bronze cauldrons and tripods for cooking and warming food (communal eating)
 - Product of the EIA due to prestigious feasting at this time
 - Rare from before the 8th century as bronze was rarely circulating, older examples were likely recycled
 - Large and highly ornamented, may have been high-status gifts and rewards

### EIA Architecture
 - Monumental stone building ceased after 1100 BCE
 - Largest structures during this period were the family homes, one-room curvilinear houses
	 - Elite versions sometimes had megaron form, porch, living space, storage room
 - Mycenaean villages constructed on regular rectilinear plans, EIA settlements had houses dispersed irregularly over site areas

### EIA (Protogeometric) Lefkandi
 - Monumental tumulus in hills of Toumba on Euboea covers large megaron-style apsidal building
	 - Dressed stone foundation, mudbrick and wooden walls, thatched roof
	 - Dated to 1000 BCE, traditional studies suggest Greek society hit lowest levels of complexity
	 - Likely used by elite family for communal feasting rituals
 - Large cemetery on the side of tumulus, grave goods include pottery and gold jewelry
	 - People of Toumba were exchanging for eastern Mediterranean and Egyptian goods
 - Know this was an elite residence by burials
	 - Two burial pits, north pit of 4 horse skeletons, south pit containing elite male and female burial
	 - Male cremated, deposited in bronze urn surrounded by iron weapons, female inhumed with gold jewelry

### Lefkandi Centaur
 - Most recognizable artifact
 - Found Toumba tomb 3 in 1969
 - Late protogeometric ceramic centaur, return to figurative art and growing Greek interest in writing and illustrating individuals and scenes from heroic tales

### EIA Society from Graves, Houses, Pots
 - Use burial and domestic evidence to hypothesise social organization
 - Restricted burial to 1/3-1/2 of population (Archaic agathoi class, the "good") includes the basileus class and yeoman farmers (Archaic hoplite class)
	 - Remaining population was subservient peasant class (Archaic kakoi class, the "bad")
 - Combined with landscape theories, looks like social power of basileus came largely from labour of peasant class
	 - Agricultural land is relatively scarce
 - Late Geometric pottery shows male leaders constantly armed with swords and spears
	 - Ruling cheiftains and middle-class retinues kept peasantry under control with force
	 - Needed labour to fund lavish lifestyles

### End of Dark Ages: Demographic Recovery
 - Problems with trying to understand population dynamics by landscape survey alone
	 - What does the surficial artifact record mean?
	 - How many sherds make a site?
	 - How does it work if the pottery is undatable or damaged beyond recognition?
 - Don't know exact mechanisms of demographic recovery from this period, likely different in each region
 - More people living in the landscape by Late Geometric than Protogeometric, nucleating into competing villages

### End of Dark Ages: Settlement
 - Patchwork of closely spaced hamlets focused on defensible high point tighten into single communities
 - After 750 BCE, curvilinear houses replaced by rectangular houses with stone foundations
	 - First at Athens
 - Civic planning represents emergence of corporate society and citizenry
	 - Anticipates Hippodamian plan (grid street pattern) of the polis
 - Burial moves from within city boundaries to outside, separating living and dead

### End of Dark Ages: Economic Recovery
 - Aegean would not experience Mycenaean-levels of economic integration until Archaic period
 - Cemeteries show increasingly rich grave goods, wooden temples contain rich votive offerings
 - Greek pottery exported as far as Levant (east) and Villanovans (west)
 - Use of iron improved, bronze becomes more intricate and plentiful with resumed import of copper and tin (tripods)
 - All made possible by slow demographic recovery and redevelopment of wealth
	 - Externally by Phoenician traders

### End of Dark Ages: Social Evolution
 - Rising wealth and expanding populations result in social shift in 8th century BCE
	 - Late Geometric Revolution
 - Two solutions for handling growing complexity:
	 - Elite faction wanted to retain traditional hierarchies of aristocratic power
	 - Middling faction (won out with city-state model during late Archaic and Classical periods) wanted more egalitarian citizen community inclusive of peasantry
		 - Emphasize local agro-pastoralism, internalize social life within the city-state
 - See tensions in fluctuations in burial practices, all classes are allowed cemetery burials in this period
 - Investments in art, public monuments, poetry, first Olympic Games in this period in 776 BCCE
 - Tension resulted in half the Classical poleis having moderate democracy and slaves, other half had serfdom or exclusive citizenship rights for upper classes only

### End of Dark Ages: First Alphabet
 - Mid to Late 8th century, Greek speakers adopted Phoenician Semitic script into a new system by introducing vowel sounds
 - Extremely versatile and used by several different eastern Mediterranean societies
 - By end of period, 750-700 BCE, Homeric Poems and works of Heiod recorded in ancient Greek
