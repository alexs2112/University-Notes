# Late Roman Italy
### Restoring the Empire
 - 376 CE: Emperors Valentinian II (West) and Valens (East) decreed no local officials could build new structures in Rome, must instead improve old buildings
 - Many monuments and buildings went into a state of decay during the third century by neglect of Rome from the Tetrarchy
 - Roman Forum underwent period of restoration
	 - Aristocrats and politicians used this as an excuse to put their names to older structures
**The Curia Senatus (The Senate House)**:
 - Tetrarchy and Constantine paid to have the old senate house (Curia Julia) restored in Roman Forum
 - Roman senate, no longer internationally powerful, was still involved in administrating Italy
	 - Noble and aristocratic duty
 - Senate continued to meet until 603, in 630 it was converted into a church (Sant'Adriano al Foro)
	 - Mussolini had it deconsecrated, strip building of its Christian decorations to expose old imperial glory
 - Altar once held golden statue of the Goddess Victory, removed by Constantius II in 357 (pagan connotations)
**Late Antique Church**:
 - Adoption of Christianity as religion of the state in 312 CE (Constantine's Edict of Tolerance)
 - Early worship: Conducted in house-churches, burial secretly in catacombs
 - Open worship: Jewish tradition meant worship needed to happen indoors, burial preferred near holy sites
 - Paganism tolerated during this period, Greco-Roman temples left abandoned or converted to Christian use
**Christian Basilica**:
 - Pagan temple worship meant to be conducted outside the temple, too small for Christian worshippers
 - Roman basilica worked for this, the raised apse at one end to be the space for clergy and bishop
	 - Many of the few buildings constructed in late antiquity were basilicas for ecclesiastical use, mostly small
 - Had wall decorations lining the nave (main hall) to remind mostly illiterate congregation of bible stories
 - Some large ones like Old Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome (360-1505)
**Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus**:
 - Old St Peter's Basilica was demolished, monumental marble sarcophagus was discovered
 - Inscription confirmed to be Junius Bassus, died 359 CE during reign of Constantius II
	 - Senator in charge of city of Rome as praefectus urbi, converted to Christianity on his deathbed
 - Most exquisite late antique sarcophagus with Christian imagery, craftworkers with incredible skill
**Death and Burial**:
 - Most people buried in simple earthen graves or alla cappucina tombs
	 - Sometimes two imbrex tiles combined to create libation tube for wine for the deceased
	 - Use of these tiles speak to recycling mentality of the period
 - These tombs increasingly appeared in cemeteries surrounding martyrial shrines
	 - Both outside and within city boundaries
	 - First time in Roman period, burials encroaching on civic spaces
**Outside the Capitals**:
 - Rest of Italy in early phase of long period of urban contraction and simplification (decay?)
 - One of the largest early changes: Steep decline in private euergetism, little personal gain in civic buildings
	 - Only path to success for aristocrats was in Rome, Milan, Constantinople
 - Traditional parts of urban fabric of Italian towns (temples, theaters, bath complexes) fall into disuse

### The Fourth Century Landscape
 - Continued as it had during the third century: Villas still operated, roads still used, fields and pastures used
 - Regional surveys highlighting small differences in villa survivals, urban contraction, increase in village settlements (vici)
 - More alarming: Inward-creeping militarization of the landscape under Constantine
	 - Weaker part of the Alpine defenses were fortified
	 - Network of forts, walls, towers: Claustra

### End of the Fourth Century CE
 - Imperial succession is confusing after the death of Constantine in 337 CE
	 - Divided empire between three sons, who promptly began murdering each other
	 - No political stability until Theodosius the Great (379-395 CE)
 - Before Theodosius: Barbarian pressure felt on the Danube and Rhine frontiers
	 - Eastern emperor Valens (364-378 CE) killed at battle of Adrianople by Gothic army
	 - Goths entered eastern empire to escape Huns, mistreated by the Romans
	 - Rebellion eventually ended by Theodosius who gave them lands, incorporating warriors into the army
	 - Huns continued to threaten the east, and then the west, into the 450s
 - Theodosius was the last emperor to rule over a united Roman empire

### Fifth Century CE
 - Sons of Theodosius, Honorius and Arcadius, ruled the west and east as children
	 - Generals ruled via proxy
	 - Barbarian raids in the east looked likely to collapse the eastern Roman government
	 - West soon under assault during this migration period
 - Goths, Vandals, Franks, Saxons wanted new lands to farm and build communities
	 - Rome didn't accept them as farmers with their warrior ethos
 - Early 5th century, Honorius' generalissimi Stilicho kept Vandals and Goths out of Italy
	 - In case of attack, royal court moved from open plain of Milan to swampy defendable Adriatic coast
 - Stilicho was executed for his successes in 408 CE, enormous mistake
	 - Visigoths (under king Alaric) invaded Italy from the north, bypassing Ravenna and going straight to Rome
 - City was sacked in 410 CE, a turning point
**Militarization of Towns**;
 - Major investment in urban defenses over 300s, originally Rome, eventually every northern town built walls
 - Some buildings had to be destroyed depending on the route of the new walls
	 - Some walls had earlier buildings stuck in them, others built with spolia from nearby temples/houses
	 - Very difficult to date accurately
 - Unknown who paid for these walls
 - Not build due to panic, serious well-engineered defenses that took a long time to complete
	 - Spolia not out of desperation, calculated and economic necessity
 - By the 5th century, work appears to accelerate
**Late Antique Urbanism**:
 - As temples and public buildings are dismantled and reused in fortifications and churches, latter emerge as central places in towns
	 - Adjacent buildings appear in use, ones on the outskirts fall into disrepair
 - Roman domus, insulae, rural villas have rooms chopped into smaller spaces by wood posts and makeshift walls. For influx of troops needing places to live in the city, unsure why this is in the countryside
**Landscape**:
 - Surviving maps (Tabula Peutingeriana) show an active road network over later fourth century, problems in 5th
	 - Legislation: Road repairs become rare
**Melania the Younger**:
 - 383-439 CE, inherited parents massive wealth, donated all of it to ecclesiastical institutions around 408 CE
 - Owned vast properties in Italy, Sicily, Iberia, North Africa. Forests, agricultural fields, pastures
 - Over late antiquity, increasing insecurity and Christian devotion saw the church accumulate large wealth
**Loss of the Breadbaskets**:
 - Economically: Most devastating was the loss of Africa to the Vandals
	 - Rome and Italy depended on the annona shipments to feed the people
	 - 439 CE,Vandals took Carthage, grain shipments from Africa ceased
	 - Vandals turned the annona fleet into a navy
 - Vandal raiding became common in southern Italy and Sicily
	 - Huns attacked from the north at the same time
	 - Various peace treaties were signed and mostly ignored
	 - The Huns retreated after Atilla died in 453 CE
 - Romans tried buying grain from the Vandals but prices were exorbitant and delivery was spotty
 - 455: Vandal king Geiseric (435-477 CE) sacked Rome
 - 460s: Vandals also took Sicily, cutting off Rome's last secure grain supply
 - Western empire shrank to the size of peninsular Italy, some territory over the Alps
**Empty Landscape**:
 - Italians still needed food and tools, warfare was localized and mainly affected cities
 - Some abandonments, tax burden paused for extended periods (hard time collecting taxes)
 - Only cities still received ARS shipments to Italy from Africa, little found its way to the countryside
	 - No finewars, rural people began making coarsewares
	 - Amphoras still transported

### Late Antique Southern Italy
 - Northern Italy fortifies and villa numbers decline
 - Southern Italy remains unfortified, landscape experiences economic boom
 - Central Italy, particularly Rome, needed supplies. Late antique southern villas increase in size dramatically
 - Architectural development increases use of apses in domestic spaces
	 - Triconch apsidal triclinium becomes popular
 - Rich fled to the east or their country estates, paid to expand with incredible luxury
	 - Rural coloni and slaves increasingly turning to each other in a communal fashion

### End of the Emperor
 - From Honorius on, fate of western emperors were tied to their strong generals (magister militum)
 - Kept Italy secure as the rest of the western empire collapsed to barbarian settlers
	 - Period of constant warefare, boundary disputes, attempted marriage alliances
 - After Honorius, western government held together by various generals who raised puppet emperors
	 - Most saw violent ends within a decade of assuming power
 - Last western emperor: Romulus Augustulus, 12 year old son of magister militum Orestes
	 - Roman general named Odoacer killed Orestes and deposed Romulus in 476 CE
	 - Instead of new emperor, Odoacer sent the imperial insignia to easter emperor Zeno
		 - Odoacer granted title of Patrician, allowed to rule Italy as its king under Zeno
 - Western Roman Empire fell when Romulus Augustulus was deposed
	 - To the Italians, life in 475 was the same as 477
	 - Odoacer brought stability and calm to the peninsula, even managed to retake Sicily from the Vandals and control the whole Adriatic
 - Control of the west constricted to Italy, became easier to manage politically and economically
 - Farmers still farmed, rich owned land, everyone paid taxes
 - Odoacer ruled Italy as a Roman
 - Roman Italy, not over yet, medieval world is fast approaching
