### Material Culture:
 - Objects of human manufacture, modification, use, inform on past human activities
 - Artifacts, artistic productions, monuments, biological remains

### Archaeological Evidence
 - Primary scales of archaeological inquiry:
 - **Artifact**: Typology, manufacture, use, provenience, provenance/taphonomy
 - **Site**: Typology, occupation history, formation history, activity areas
 - **Landscape**: Settlement networks, economic integration (trade), land use, infrastructure
 - Represent the *Archaeological Record*

Everything below is copied from [[02 - Methods of Prehistory]]
### Methods of Investigation:
 - Provenance: History of an object, past roles
 - Survey: Surface of the earth or bottom of a waterbody, collect and identify artifacts, site boundaries
 - Excavation: Controlled stratigraphic removal of depositional layers from a site to understand their spatial and temporal relationships
 - Artifacts < Sites < Landscape

### Context:
 - Spatial and temporal position of all objects, allow for interpretation of material culture, relationships over space and time
 - Horizontal Context: Relationships between artifacts on sites, between sites on landscapes
 - Vertical Context: Encountered through excavation

### Core Tenants of Archaeological Interpretation
1. Cannot cherry pick evidence
2. Evidence must be explainable through logic of historical sciences (stratigraphy, context, typology, chronology)
3. Cannot make a claim based on negative/weak evidence, deflect burden of proof to critics
4. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, ambiguous or unproven hypotheses cannot form the foundation of new theories or understandings
 - Separates study of archaeology from pseudoarchaeology and exercises to undermine public trust in expertise and science

### Chronology
 - Two main types of dating in archaeology:
 - **Relative Dating**: traditional, relational, contextual, regional
	 - Three-Age and Seriation
	 - Often applied to nebulous region or microregion
	 - Must be double-checked and legitimized through synchronisms (when material cultures between two regions match)
 - **Absolute Dating**: modern, calendrical, contextual, interregional
	 - Quantitative
	 - Often relevant only for certain sites or contexts
	 - Dendrochronological dating, C14 dating, Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS), Radiocarbon Dating, Thermoluminescence Dating, Potassium-Argon Dating
	 - In later periods, use artifacts like coins or epigraphy to also provide absolute dates

### Three Age System
 - Danish antiquarian Christian Jurgensen Thomsen (1788-1865)
 - Organized artifact collections in National Museum of Denmark according to evolutionary development scheme called the Three-Age System
 - Recognized a historical progression of artifacts from Stone, to Bronze, then Iron
	 - Recognized associated tools and artifacts must also date to those periods

### Stratigraphic Method
 - End of 19th century, archaeology was a professional discipline. Modern excavation, analytical methods emerged
 - Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie (1853-1942), English Egyptologist
	 - Excavated sites layer by layer, collected all artifacts from each strata
 - Also arranged pottery shards by their evolving forms and styles (*seriation*), recognized importance of creating pottery typologies to determine relative dating of deposits
End of copied notes

### Pottery:
 - Used by Europeans since the Late Mesolithic (9000BCE) and earlier in Asia (20kBCE)
 - Vessels can break easily, sherds are nearly indestructible due to firing process
 - Vessel forms and decorations are highly stylized depending on regional, cultural, temporal variables
 - Pottery sherds can get easily turned up by modern ploughs driving over sites in agricultural fields, find them during archaeological landscape survey
 - Ceramic vessels have undergone significant study, can usually date varieties of vesel forms, paste, glaze, slips, paint, into ranges of 25-100 years (sometimes only 100-200 years)

### Relative Dating
 - Applied to poorly defined regions, microregions
 - Key to double checking, legitimizing relative dating schemes is to find synchronisms
 - Synchronism when material culture from one regional chronology matches material culture (usually pottery) from another region
 - In Greece, pottery synchronisms are important to understand how Cyclades, mainland, Crete, are related to each other
 - Italy, synchronisms help explain the flow of populations

### Absolute Dating
 - **Dendrochronology** (tree-ring dating) is the science of measuring and comparing tree growth rings
 - **Carbon Dating** and **Potassium Argon Dating** in [[02 - Methods of Prehistory]]
 - Consider two concepts when dating a site:
	 - *Terminus post quem*: The limit after which, earliest possible date of a deposit or site. Dated coins provide a terminus post quem for their context sicne they were deposited after the year they were made
	 - *Terminus ante quem*: Limit after which, latest possible date of a deposit or site, we know the terminus ante quem for Pompeii is AD 79 due to eruption. All artifacts buried by pyroclastic material were used and deposited before the eruption
