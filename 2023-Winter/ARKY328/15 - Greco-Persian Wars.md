### Classical Period Overview (500-323 BCE)
 - Period begins with international warfare instigated by the Persian Empire
 - Athens is best known example of a Classical polis, may be least representative due to size and power
 - After Persian defeat, Greek city-states resume warring with each other -> Peloponnesian Wars
 - Sparta defeats Athens at the end of the 5th century, dominate mainland Greece until the Thebans seize power in 370s and 360s
 - After 340 BCE, Macedonians control Greece up to the death of Alexander in 323 BCE

### Classical Greece Foundations in the West
 - Democratic principles are developed and practiced
 - Major achievements in drama and poetry
 - Discipline of History begins
 - Great advances in philosophy and science
 - Many monuments survive to the present
 - Art, mobile and immobile, reach new forms of sophistication

### True Historical Archaeology
 - Writing was present in the Archaic, helps understand minds of poets and playwrights
	 - Homer, Iliad + Odyssey, might provide first Greek texts useful for archaeologists
		 - Not true historical texts, much debate over actual utility in understanding the past
 - Classical period: Writing is of immense utility in understanding the archaeological record
 - Nature of archaeological record: Usually unable to separate out the lives of individuals
	 - Archaeologically, we know the Greeks fought Persian invasion forces at several sites, defenses heightened
	 - Can identify change and hypothesize broad strokes, can't understand the mind of Athenian general Themistocles to identify the efforts he took to defend Athens
	 - Nor can we identify political intrigue behind Sparta's move to oust the general in 478 BCE
 - What we know of Themistocles comes from ancient historians
	 - Should these accounts be taken as fact?

### Historical Archaeological Interpretation
 - Must always question the evidence, whether textual or artifactual
 - Rely on as many data points as possible
 - Interpretations of archaeological data are based on evidence, previous knowledge, and personal biases
 - All interpretations must be designed logically, presented clearly, debated to find expert consensus

### Classical Historical Sources

### Political Background
 - Conflict between aristocratic families while middle and lower classes (hoplites and peltasts) looked to resolve grievances and satisfy ambitions
	 - Different for serf-societies like Sparta and Crete, wider upper class
 - Political turmoil at the end of the Archaic, tyrants leading coups to take control over poleis
	 - Athens: Expulsion of Peisistratid dynasty of tyrants ushered in democratic reforms
		 - They united Attica, started process of Athenian imperial dominance
 - 5th century BCE, all freeborn males could vote, any could reach high political offices, rich were required to subsidize war efforts and public monuments (liturgies, public service)
 - After Athens lost preeminence at the end of the 5th century, democratic reforms continued to spread throughout Greece, particularly from Thebes

### Historical Background
 - Greek experiments in democracy, philosophy, science, almost cut short by territorial expansion of the Persian Achaemenid Empire in the early 5th century BCE
 - Disunited city-states couldn't beat this imperial war machine, easily conquered northern Greece (Macedon, many eastern Aegean islands)
 - Events of the Greco-Persian Wars are numerous, 5 events stand out for their historical significance

### The Battle of Marathon
 - 490 BCE Persians, under King Darius I landed an army at the Bay of Marathon
 - Athenians and Plataeans joined forces and defeated the invading Persians
 - Greeks used knowledge of the landscape to render the Persian cavalry useless by forcing the main Persian army in between mountains and marshlands
 - Demonstrated to the Greeks how useful the phalanx was on lightly armored troops
	 - Previously, used the phalanx on each other, evenly matched
	 - Here it was clear that the formation was devastatingly effective
 - Victory was an immense moral boost for the Greeks, demonstration how effective they could be when united
 - Greek dead were both cremated and interred on site
	 - Two separate tumuli, odd as they were out of style as burial rites since the 7th century BCE
 - Commemorative victory column also raised

### The Battle of Thermopylae
 - 480 BCE (10 years later), son of Darius, King Xerxes, returned to subjugate Greece with a larger force
 - Many of his own ships lost in storms sailing down the Aegean, landed in the Straits of Euboea at the Gulf of Malia
 - Spartans, absent from Marathon, defied their council and sent a small force to hold the only good passage south into Boeotia
	 - Herodotus tells us they were betrayed, King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans were killed
	 - Xerxes continued his campaign south toward Athens
 - Environmental archaeology at Thermopylae demonstrated the modern Malian Gulf is significantly shallower today than during 5th century BCE
	 - Soil cores to collect plant material
	 - Type of plant and its radiocarbon date allowed researchers to map how the shoreline shifted
	 - Data helps reconstruct the 5th century landscape to better understand the environmental context of this event

### The Sack of Athens
 - Attica open to Persian advance, Boeotia fell to the Persians and Thespiae and Plataea were razed
 - Athenian general Themistocles evacuated most of the Athenians to the island of Salamis, abandoned Athens
 - Peloponnesian allies built a wall across the Isthmus of Corinth to slow the Persian advance
 - 480 BCE, Persians arrived at Athens. Few people remained, barricaded in the Acropolis
	 - Defeated, Xerxes ordered the whole city to be burned
	 - Old Temple of Athena and Old Parthenon were destroyed
 - German excavation the Athenian Acropolis
	 - Layers of destruction debris: Pererschutt (Persian Rubble)
	 - Debris full of late Archaic sculptures, some specifically decapitated
 - Athenians returned to the destroyed city, ceremoniously buried the statues on the Acropolis before rebuilding
 - Discovery of the statues were a major discovery for the discipline of art history

### The Battle of Salamis
 - Spartans dominated land, Athenians dominated the sea
 - After Athens was destroyed, remaining Greeks were outnumbered
 - Themistocles had a plan to trick Xerxes into sending his fleet into the straights of Salamis
	 - Cramped conditions, greater numbers were a hindrance
	 - Greek triremes formed a line, advanced on disoriented Persians, fully defeating them
 - Xerxes considered the razing of Athens and conquering of Thessaly, Phocis, Boeotia, Euboea, Attica as victory
	 - Left Greece with much of his remaining fleet, left his general Mardonius to take the Peloponnese
 - 2017: Underwater archaeological research suggested a stretch of laid stone represented the base of a port structure active at Ambelakia Bay (5th-3rd century BCE) on Salamis
	 - Adjacent to the Polyandreion of Salamis, mass grave tomb, victory trophy erected at nearby Kynosoura after the battle
	 - With descriptions from historical texts, likely spot where the Greeks waited for the Persians to enter the straight to spring their trap

### The Battle of Plataea
 - One year after Salamis, 479 BCE, united Greek army of Tegeans, Athenians, Corinthians, Megarians, all commanded by the Spartans, marched out of the Peloponnese to the plane of Plataea to confront the Persian army (including Macedonians)
 - Greeks refused to come into prime cavalry terrain, waited for the Persians to attack
	 - 11 days of skirmishing, Persians cut off the Greek supply lines
	 - Greeks used this as an opportunity to appear fragmented, drawing back and tricking the Persians into thinking they were retreating
	 - Persians crossed the Asopus and pursued each segment of the army individually, dividing their forces
 - Spartans, Athenians, Tegeans then turned back onto the Persians and fought their fragmented army
	 - Definitive victory using superior Spartan tactics and the phalanx
 - After the battle, Persian weapons were melted down to create a bronze column of three entwined snakes
	 - Golden tripod on top, erected at Delphi
	 - In 324 CE, Constantine the Great moved the column to Constantinople in the Hippodrome where it remains today
	 - Golden tripod long lost, column remained intact until the Ottoman occupation
	 - 1400s, turned into a fountain, Mehmed the Conqueror smashed one snake head to show his strength
	 - 1700 it was toppled, all that remains is the base and one snake head

### Aftermath of the Greco-Persian Wars
 - Greeks gained sense of ethnic unity during the wars
 - Various victories encouraged different ambitions among city-states, rivalries emerged immediately
 - After Plataea in 479 BCE, Athenians returned to their city-state and started rebuilding
 - Themistocles initiated a series of building projects called the Long Walls
	 - If unguardad, Spartans could easily take the city
	 - Enormous circuit of Long Walls were built to protect Athens and connect the city with its ports at Piraeus and Phaleron, segments still visible today
 - Project alarmed the Spartans, relations between them degraded over the 5th century
