### Ice Age
 - 2.5 and 2.3 mya, changes to Earth's orbital tilt led to a cooling period
 - Pleistocene: Great Ice Age
	 - Episodic glacial periods of gradual cooling (stadials) and periods of quicker warming (interstadials)
	 - Between glacials, interglacials (warmer)

### Pleistocene Africa
 - During glacial periods, moisture was condensed in northern glaciers with a drier Earth
	 - Sahara desert expanded during glacial periods, shrank during interglacial periods (more plants)
 - Early Homo ancestors lived in a period of extreme climatic shifts every 100k years

### Lower Paleolithic
 - Start of the Pleistocene to 300k-200k BCE is called the Lower Paleolithic
 - two main archaeological cultures, stone tool industries used to define this period
	 - Oldowan (2.5 - 1.7 mya)
	 - Acheulean (1.7 mya - 200 kya)
 - Archaeological Culture: recurring assemblage of artifacts from a group of people, implies shared material culture
	 - Not equal to culture in a modern sense
 - Industry to highlight that they had knowledge about how to make very specific types of stone tools

### Homo Habilis
 - Contemporary with Paranthropus, found at sites between 2.5, 1.6 mya in East Africa
 - 3 ft tall, H. Habilis (500-800 cc) had a larger cranial capacity than Australopithecines (450-475 cc) and chimps (300-500 cc)
	 - Earliest species assigned genus Homo
 - First identified at Olduvai gorge in 1964 by Louis Leakey
 - Much diversity amongst fossils, suggest at least two contemporary lineages in East Africa
 - H. Habilis was a toolmaker

### Stone Tools
 - Objects manufactured by people for use in completing daily tasks
	 - Include whole rocks or naturally fractured items
	 - Generally consist of a core stone and a flake removed from it
	 - Best stones: small even grains (obsidian, cherts/flints, quartzites)
 - Study of stone tools: Lithic Analysis
	 - Collect all stone artifacts from sites to study, including waste products from manufacture (debitage)

### Origin of Tool Use
 - Stone tools: oldest archaeological artifacts on Earth
 - Chimps, crows, dolphins all use tools, learned from observation of parents

### Lomekwian: First Tools
 - First tools probably made of perishable woods, have not survived
 - Oldest stone tools ever found: small assemblage from Lomekwi 3 in Kenya
	 - 83 cores, 35 flakes were recovered
 - Next oldest: 3000 stone tools from a single layer at Gona in Hadar of Ethiopia, made sometime between 2.9-2.3 mya

### Oldowan Industry
 - Tools used by H. Habilis are part of the Oldowan Industry/Industrial Complex/Culture
 - Between 2.5-1.7 mya, Olduvai Gorge Beds I
 - Represent a simple core and flake style of tool (low effort)
	 - Flakes used for finer work like slicing
	 - Cores used for heavy work like crushing or breaking
 - H. Habilis carried these items (curated) through the landscape, sometimes up to 14 km (chimps do not do this)

### Homo Erectus
 - Emerged around 1.9 mya, lived until maybe 100 kya, most succesful human species
 - Huge evolutionary leap from H Habilis, slimmer, taller (5, even 6 ft) with a much larger brain case (1000 cc)
	 - Maybe the first hairless hominin
 - First H. Erectus was found in Indonesia in 1891
 - Used Oldowan tools for the first 400k years
	 - Critical change: take flakes off both sides of the core to create an even sharper edge
	 - Acheulean tools

### Acheulean Industry
 - Earliest in East Africa between 1.7-1.5 mya
 - Site Kokiselei 4 in Kenya, crude Acheulian tools were in a context to 1.76 mya, found mixed with Oldowan tools
 - Characteristic tool: Biface, flaking on both sides of the stone
	 - Not least effort, skillfully crafted with symmetry and sharp edges
	 - Characteristic form: The handaxe, ranging in shape (ovals, teardrops, triangles)
 - Used for over 1 million years, clearly effective, not sure what they were used for
	 - Tanzania suggests they were used for woodworking

### Stone Tools, Human Brain
 - As hominins evolved their tools also did, smaller, easier to grip, more complex
 - Lomekwian: 3.3 mya
	 - Produced quickly
 - Oldowan: ~2.6 mya
	 - Require knowledge of stone mechanics, flaking characteristics that take hours of practice
 - Acheulean: 1.76 mya
	 - Require knowledge of the final form in your mind before you start flaking, need to imagine the shape of the tool inside the raw stone
- Between humans and chimps, not sure which they more clearly resemble

### Hunters or Scavengers
 - Chimps hunt small animals in packs, alpha males share meat as a form of socialization
 - Still unsure about humans. Evidence left on animal forms (gnawing, cut marks from tools) but unsure which events happened first

### Living Floors and Base Camps
 - Chimps hunt and consume meat on the spot, often sharing
 - Modern hunter gatherers also share meat, but bring it back to a camp
 - Glynn Isaac: Developed home-base/food-sharing model
	 - Hominins created places on the landscape to bring meat back and share amongst the community
	 - The ability to share, not kill, drove evolution

### Archaeological Record as Palimpsest
 - Oldest archaeological record is notoriously difficult to interpret
 - Like a palimpsest, overlaid by multiple occupations that partially erase what came before, never a clear picture
 - Sometimes geological, fluvial processes bring bones and stone tools together. Sometimes taphonomic processes modify bones multiple times before final deposition
 - What we know: Early hominins had the knowledge to make and carry stone tools, also appear to move animal carcasses
	 - Can't prove that they moved them into base camps, or if they were effective hunters
