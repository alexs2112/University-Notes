# Themes
### Review of the Holocene
 - By 15k BP, ice sheets began to recede, period of postglacial warmth began around 11.65k BP
 - With these climatic changes, new grasses immigrated into the Zagros Mountains of Iran
	 - Wild wheat and barley
 - In Mexico, ancestor of maize was growing in mountain valleys of central highlands

### Hunter-Gatherers
 - During last Glacial Maximum most late Pleistocene environments could only support small groups of people
	 - Minus favoured areas: SW France, Nile Valley, American Midwest
 - In early Holocene: Populations increased because environments became more supportive
	 - Made it harder to move into new areas, people needed to exploit wider ranges of food resources more efficiently
 - Result: Hunter-gatherers also appear to become more complex

### Koster Site
 - Illinois River Valley
 - Chronicles intensification of lifeways from 7500 BCE to 1200 CE:
	 - First visitors: Paleoindian hunter-gatherers camping on the valley edge
	 - Around 6500 BCE: base camp established for ~25 people to exploit fall hickory nut harvests
	 - Between 5600-5000 BCE: mud and brush houses built, occupied year round. Ate thousands of fish and mussels, hickory nuts in fall, migratory birds in spring.
		 - People ate food from within 5km range
	 - After 2500 BCE: Population was high, experimentation occurred with different resourcecs with evidence for elaborate food storage
 - Trends: Sedentary occupation, intensive exploitation of food resources, organized mass processing, storage of staple foods.

### Hunter-Gatherer Complexity
 - Developed in a number of different conditions thanks to three general conditions:
1. Population movements limited by geography or neighbours
2. Resources were abundant and predictable in their seasonal appearance
3. Population growth may have resulted in food shortages, usually leading to intensification of food procurement that could (not always) result in migration or intensification of food production
 - Traditional view: Complex hunter-gatherers common in places with abundant freshwater or marine resources
 - Process: Increasing population densities appear in restricted territories, more varied diets result in more specialized toolkits, food storage systems, preservation techniques
 - Groups lived in sedentary, large basecamps with kin leaders who monopolized trade and some social rituals
	 - These groups practiced a mix of domestication and hunting+gathering
 - The point: Invention of agriculture itself wasnt important. What was important is the transition from hunting and gathering to cultivation and its results over thousands of years.

### Studying Early Food Production
 - Floatation methods are essential for studying early food production
	 - Soil samples excavated are passed through water. Seeds or pits, usually carbonized, float to the surface while sediment falls to the bottom. Organic matter is scooped off the top, dried, then analyzed macro/microscopically
 - Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is particularly vital
	 - Allows archaeobotanists to see micrmorphological differences between the tiniest wild/domestic varieties
 - Genetic fingerprinting is also important

### Five Consequences of Food Production
 - Spread of food production around the world took about 8000 years
1. Resulted in much higher population densities
2. The territory required for ccultivation is much smaller than for hunter-gatherers
	 - If good farmland is running out, people could easily clear nearby areas
	 - Farming likely spread because of requirements for new lands, issues of inheritence, desires for independence
3. Sedentism occurred before adoption of agriculture. When agriculture emerged, heavier toolkits for farming appear 
4. Food production led to changing attitudes towards the environment. Farmers altered the landscape through exploitation
	 - Cut down trees and burned vegetation to clear plots in cycles of clearing, cultivating, leaving fallow (to regenerate nutrients)
	 - Stripped lands of their grasses and trees, meaning heavy rainfall could strip hills of valuable soil
5. Increasing populations became controlled by new factors
	 - Disease, available food supplies, water supplies, increase in periods of food shortage and famine

### Was Farming Healthy?
 - Old answer: Yes, people theoretically worked less and lived better, longer lives with more food
 - Anthropologists studying Kung San of Kalahari Desert (South Africa) challenged these views. Hunter-gatherers were leisurely and worked much less than farmers, with more balanced diets
	 - Also, sedentary life with high population made farmers more vulnerable to famine or disease
 - Paleopathological studies of early Neolithic skeletons were also informative: High incidences of anemia and slow growth from apparent malnutrition
	 - Farming brought a decline in human life
 - Some groups chose farming for one reason or another and became stuck doing it. Other groups decided not to become farmers at all.

### Animal Domestication
 - Advantage of domestication: Regular meat supply, later items like milk, cheese, butter, skins
	 - During Neolithic, people bred animals for transportation and traction/ploughing
 - Domestication: Implies genetic selection, emphasizing special features of continuing use for humans
 - Examples: Wild sheep have no wool, wild chickens do not lay surplus eggs, wild cows do not produce milk after their offspring mature
 - No moment of invention for this, dont know exactly how domestication began. 3 elements are vital:
	 - Constraints on animal movements
	 - Constraints on animal breeding
	 - Control of feeding to shape future generations
 - Most likely: A long period of herd management preceded full domestication
	 - Magdalenians concentrated heavily on reindeer
	 - Late Pleistocene hunters in the Middle East concentrated on gazelles
	 - Hunters on the Caspian Sea hunted wild sheep and goats intensively
 - Goats and Sheep: High social animals, follow dominant herd members and tolerate feeding and breeding in confinement. Perfect for domestication
 - As people recognized the benefits of partially tamed animals, different species were taken and mutual dependence between humans and animals grew
	 - Different story: Cats are solitary hunters and not pack animals, how were they domesticated? Chose to join us for the opportunities they found for themselves
 - **Archaeology**:
	 - Only evidence of early domestication of their animals is their bones
		 - Problem: Early domesticates are almost indistinguishable from wild varieties at this stage
		 - Evidence must be from profile of entire faunal assemblages
	 - Example: Goats and sheep, small but yield lots of meat
		 - Goat bones from Nevali Cori in Turkey show characteristic mortality profile of a managed herd: Surplus males killed before adulthood, females kept for many years for breeding and milk.
		 - In hunting profiles: Strong focus on large adult males

### Plant Cultivation
 - Far fewer wild plants were domesticated compared to those foraged
	 - First domesticated were flavorful, spicy, sweet, industrial, hallucinatory, or medicinal
 - Domestication scenario: In sub-Saharan Africa, experimenting with planting wild root crops preceded formal agriculture. Maybe it was done unconsciously
 - Difference between wild and domestic wheat: 
	 - Wild cereals have brittle rachis connecting seed to stem, advantageous for spreading the grass naturally
	 - Cultivated cereals selected for tough rachis unconsciously, seeds that survived harvest for replanting were those with tougher rachis and were not eaten
	 - Process probably took 1000-2000 years because of experimentation, starts + stops in farming

### Tools of Domestication
 - Technological consequences of food production are just as important as new foods
 - More settled life led to lasting styles of more substantial houses
 - Earliest farmers in SW Asia made and dried bricks of mud into small houses with flat roofs. Less substantial houses had reed or thatched roofs
 - In temperate Europe: Timber for houses of various shapes and sizes with thatched roofs
 - Africa: Huts made from grass, sticks and clay
 - Nomadic pastoralists of the steppe: No need for permanent houses, used animal skins for clothing and tents

### Storing Food
 - Agriculture is seasonal with long periods where fields are growing or fallow. Food needed storage
	 - Grain bins, ceramic jars, clay-lined pits became essential for stockpiling food
 - Hunter-Gatherers used skins, woods, baskets to carry foods like vegetables and berries short term
 - Farmers had bigger problems: Carry grain and store water
	 - Early farmers used gourds or clay vessels, both waterproof, vessels also for cooking
 - Early pots made by coiling clay or making finger pots, hardened in simple hearths, much more durable than skin or leather bags.
	 - Old thinking: Pottery specifically to store food
	 - Reality: Used at different times in many different places to hold basically anything

### New Handheld Tools
 - People dug up wild roots with simple sticks for 10ks years. First farmers likely used the same method
	 - Before long: Wooden or stone-tipped hoes appear
 - Every farmer had to clear wild vegetation (trees) and weeds from their fields
	 - During Neolithic find new emphasis on stone axes and adzes
	 - Very effective, key: Tougher working edges, prized flint from Grand Pressigny in France over western Europe
	 - Sickles and knives: obsidian was still the most prized stone
 - These developments made people more dependent on raw exotic martials, start to see widespread long distance trade occurring.
