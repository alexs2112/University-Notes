### The Aurignacian
 - Earliest true Upper Paleolithic industry
	 - Found from Crimea to Iberia
 - Several differences compared to earlier Mousterian:
	 - Lithic technology includes more blades
	 - Bone tools become far more advanced
	 - Introduction of personal adornment
	 - First clear instance of artwork

### Aurignacian Lithic Industry
 - Key difference of more formed blade tools
	 - Produced either by Levallois technique or prismatic cores (more common)
 - Many retouched tools made from blades, many forms rare or absent from Mousterian
 - Lots of variability in Aurignacian assemblages over space and time

### Prismatic Core Technology
 - New technology associated with modern humans
 - Cobble prepared by being reduced with a flat horizontal edge
 - Length of the core is further prepared by creation of an arris to help set direction of force
 - If a blade is removed, becomes easier to remove additional blades
 - Continues until the core is exhausted

### Aurignacian Bone Industry
 - Bone and antler tools are better made, far more frequent than ever before
 - Carved and polished rather than chipped, show standardized, repetitive forms
 - Common artifacts include antler batons, bone and antler rods incised with lines (meaning?), bone awls and perforators, antler projectile points with split, forked, and beveled bases

### Aurignacian Ornamentation
 - First period in human history where we find definitive evidence for personal ornamentation
 - Clear sign of personal identity, self expression, possible cultural affiliation
 - Pendants and beads made from animal teeth, shells, fossils, stones, bones, antlers, etc

### Aurignacian Animal Figurines
 - Upper Danube (Swabian Alps) in Germany
 - Earliest examples of human 3d art, small animal carvings
 - 12 figurines in total, carved out of ivory, highly polished suggesting long time of use or suspended as pendants

### Aurignacian Anthropomorphic Figurines
 - Accompanied other ivory figurines
 - Qualify as first potential human depictions in art (not super obvious what they are, interpreted as anthropomorphic)
 - Lion-Human of Hohlenstein-Stadel: Large ivory figurine of a humanoid with the head of a lion, oldest statue ever made, carved with a lithic blade
 - Vogelherd Human-Like Figurine: Ivory cylinder with circular end as the head, covered in dots
 - Geissenklosterle Ivory Plate: Small ivory plate depicting a human with outstreched arms, sometimes an 'adorant' as it looks like a worshipper. Backside is smooth and notched with small dots
 - Venus of Hohle Fels: Oldest venus depiction, 40-35 kya. Highlights voluptuous female characteristics

### Earliest Music
 - 35-43 kya has the earliest musical instrumens
 - Bone flutes: bird bones, carved mammoth bone
 - Found in same region as the figurines
 - Suggests musical culture helped maintain group bonds

### Aurignacian Art
 - Chauvet Cave, France: Over 300 animal figures painted, includes geometric designs, dots, motifs
 - Done in black charcoal and red hematite, dated to 32-30 kya, earliest paintings in Europe

### Aurignacian Subsistence
 - Don't see any changes, still hunting big game and not much vegetation, fish, birds
 - Some suggestion that they had slightly more diverse diet than Neanderthals
 - See fewer animals on sites, suggests more individual/less communal hunting
	 - Less opportunism, greater planning and targeting of prey
 - Changes in subsistence economy is more about equipment used rather than types of animals hunted or foods eaten

### Aurignacian Settlement
 - Many sites on hilltops are eroded, those in river valleys are filled in, caves are mixed by geological processes and animal scavenging
 - Some evidence suggests higher mobility, more special purpose camps in distant areas
 - Probably had to do with warming climate (still freezing cold) allowing people to live in exposed areas
	 - Plants and animals abundant in low valleys

### Aurignacian Exchange
 - Evidence for long-distance trade
 - Items only represent small amounts of assemblages, reflect more structured social relationships compared to middle paleolithic
	 - Relationships allow people to move easily into different areas during environmental stress

### Transition to the Aurignacian: Summary
 - Immigration of biologically modern humans into Europe from Africa around 45 kya
 - Brought an emphasis of prismatic blade technology, bone, antler, ivory manufacture, knowledge of ornaments and artwork
 - Contemporary with Neanderthals who began to imitate them, mixed industries
 - Neanderthals and modern humans interbred somewhat, skeletal material with mixed traits (debate)
 - Biologically and culturally unaffected Neanderthals persisted longer in some areas
 - 28 kya, Europe was populated by groups practicing the same behaviours, similar tools, more modern
