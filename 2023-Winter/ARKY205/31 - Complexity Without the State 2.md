# Europe
### The Middle Neolithic
 - Most southern Europe used pottery forms reminiscent of Cardial culture in Middle Neolithic
 - Central and Northern Europe: The Funnel Beaker (Trichterbecker, TRB) culture
	 - Distinctive ceramic forms resembling funnels
	 - Late Neolithic: Funnel Beaker culture expands south, develops into Globular Amphora and Corded Ware

### First Farmers in Britain
 - Transition to farming happened much later in Britain than the rest of Western Europe
 - No archaeological site evidence prior to 4000 BCE, this date is often used
	 - First carbonized seeds in Britain and Ireland date to 3950 BCE
	 - First sedentary sites to around 3800 BCE, short transitional period before Neolithic life was established

### Beginnings of Metallurgy
 - Late 6th to 4th millenia BCE, first extensive use of copper, gold, silver in Europe
	 - High status individuals associated with metals at this time
 - Many copper deposits, few exploited in later Neolithic, more flint mined than copper
	 - Gold wasn't mined at all, collected from rivers or on the surface
 - Advantages of copper: Cast into shapes not possible for stone, wood, or bone
	 - Disadvantages: Wasn't stronger than wood, bone or stone

### Innovations in Exchange
**Salt**:
 - Paleolithic and Mesolithic people obtained salt from meat diets, changed with cereal diet of Neolithic
 - Middle Neolithic: First evidence of salt exploitation in Romania, Cris culture (6000-5000 BCE)
	 - Salt making vessels, trenches for brine collection
 - Brine poured into wide pots and boiled, when the water was gone the salt was scooped into ceramics, molded into briquettes or cones, then traded to other communities
**Roads**:
 - Under Funnel Beaker megalithic tomb near Kiel, Germany. Supposed cart track discovered
	 - 3500 BCE, oldest road example in Europe
 - No physical evidence, possible pictoral evidence for the first wheeled vehicle in the world
	 - Bronocice pot (Funnel Beaker) in south Poland
	 - Design etched into the body is widely believed to depict a four wheeled vehicle

### First Writing
 - 1960s, three clay tablets excavated at site of Tartaria, associated with Vinca occupation
 - Excavators suggest designs etched into them is writing that resembles Uruk III script from contemporary (3400 BCE) Mesopotamia
 - Heavily debated for two reasons:
	 - Writing in Mesopotamia developed to help deal with complexity of state societies, was administrative
		 - No administration in Middle Neolithic Vinca
	 - Other archaeologists think this plaques are intrusive to Vinca occupation, likely date to later Bronze Age
 - Markings are more likely symbols that relate to group identity or lineages
	 - Symbols used since Upper Paleolithic

### Settlement Organization
 - See greater complexity in Middle Neolithic settlements over Early Neolithic
	 - Not necessarily more sites on the landscape
	 - Farmers expand into new regions, as they move densely settled areas look sparser (exhausted soils?)
 - Middle Neolithic sites have more artifacts in general
 - Cave sites still being used sporadically
	 - Italy: Caves used for burials, shrines, feasts, rituals

### Cucenteni-Tripolye Settlements
 - Easter Carpathian Basin, over 1800 in Romania, 500 in Moldova
 - Some absolutely enormous (Talianki, Ukraine)
 - Cuceteni site was the largest settlement in Europe at this time
	 - 400ha, 2700 structures, 8000 population
 - Settlements greately increase in size from Early to Middle Neolithic, theories:
	 - Population growth due to economic stability
	 - Attempts to attract specialized artisans (potters, smiths)
	 - Intensification of agricultural production in limited spaces
	 - Threat from steppe peoples
 - Don't know much about these settlements, identified by geophysical prospection and aerial photos

### Megaliths
 - Built mostly by hunter gatherers, not agriculturalists
 - Usually refers to burial structures of stone and earth, also freestanding stones called menhirs (orthostats)
 - Four different types of megalith:
	 - Apsidal Temples
	 - Standing Stones (menhirs)
	 - Chamber Tomb (dolmen)
	 - Swinside Stone Circles
 - Designed to remain forever, durability and visibility in the landscape means every successive generation has interpreted and reinterpreted their meanings
 - No mortar used to attach stones, rollers, rope, gravity, trenches, mounds, brute strength were essential
 - Theories about construction involve complex wooden scaffolding and rollers that incrementally raise the stones into position
	 - Aside from construction trenches, no archaeological evidence for how they were built

### Late Neolithic Social Complexity
 - After 3500, more comfortable calling some Late Neolithic European societies "ranked"
 - England: Diversity and number of megaliths put up at this time shows social distinction (at least in death)
 - 3000-2200 BCE, huge number of henges constructed in SW England
	 - Likely impossible without some form of centralized authority
 - Large number probably due to many competing polities
 - Hard to separate Late from Middle Neolithic based on material culture evidence alone
	 - Late Neolithic begins and ends at different times in different places
 - Some scholars say the best-known European Late Neolithic cultures are early or Proto-Bronze Age
 - Cultures include the Globular Amphora, Corded Ware, Bell Beaker cultures

### Globular Amphora People
 - Developed out of the Middle Neolithic Funnel Beaker and Lengyel Cultures
	 - Sometimes referred to as an early form of Corded Ware Culture
		 - Looks like they eventually become subsumed into Corded Ware
 - Don't know much about them
	 - Kept pigs instead of cattle (like earlier Funnel Beakers)
 - Name comes from a really diagnostic amphora pottery form
	 - Extremely round body with 2-4 handles near the neck of the vessel
 - Besides their indicative pottery, best known today as victims
	 - Mass grave of 15 individuals excavated in southern Poland in 2011
	 - Mixed group of men, women, children
	 - Everyone killed either by blows to the head or stone arrows
		 - Most show evidence of defensive wounds on hands and arms
	 - Don't know why they were all killed, maybe expansion of Corded Ware people during violent raid

### Corded Ware People
 - One of the most widely distributed Late Neolithic cultures in Europe
 - Second phase of Corded Ware (2900-2800) appears in Carpathians, shares similarities with nearby Pit-Grave culture of Ukraine, southern Russia, Kazakhstan
 - Also known as the Battle Axe people, frequently buried with axes that had no use as tools, clearly for killing

### Bell Beaker People
 - Appear in Mediterranean and Western Europe around 2900 BCE, central Europe around 2500 BCE
	 - Lasts until 1900 BCE
	 - Often associated with megaliths, overlap Corded Ware, also an early Bronze Age group
 - Recent radiocarbon evidenec: Originated in Spain, south France, north Italy, spread from SW to NE
 - Know almost everything about them from burial contexts
 - Spread extremely widely and quickly with similar material culture
	 - Perhaps ethnic migration inspired by economic or technical specializations (speculative)
 - Gets its names from distinctive ceramics
	 - Also produced daggers, flat axe heads, halberds, all likely used as weapons
 - Clear gender division: male burials usually contained bell-shaped beaker ceramic, copper dagger, wrist guard, and a flint knife
 - Famous warrior archers

### Warfare
 - Globular Amphora mass grave is not the only example, mass graves known of Corded Ware and late Funnel Beaker people
 - Settlement evidence is weak, some sites show defensive constructions
	 - France: over 60 fortified sites from Late Neolithic
	 - Portugal: Most Late Neolithic sites are on hilltops, some fortified
