### Building Knowledge
 - Develop framework of ideas that guide and give meaning to methods and data
	 - Sociology, Anthropology, Philosophy, History, Geography, Ecology
	 - Informs interpretations

### Examples
 - Skara Brae: Neolithic settlement in Britain, interpret places like this as their spaces are familiar to us, shelves, sleeping areas, storage, etc
 - Sungir Burial: Two people are buried with tools and jewelry. Lots of questions remain, why head to head in ochre, why mammoth ivory beads and why so many, who were these people
	 - Use theory to help determine most likely interpretations, use a framework of thinking to include peer review and critique

### Broad Waves of Theory
 - Theories arent perfect
 - Issues arising from each wave has created intellectual baggage and interpretive traps
1. **Evolutionary Approach** (1850-1900)
	- Simplifies the past, unilineal evolutionism presumed all cultures could be ranked
	- Three stages: Savagery, Barbarism, Civilization
		- All cultures of each individual stage were identical to each other
	- Inspired by Darwin but based on little archaeological data, racist reaction to western encounters with indigenous groups all around the world
	- Franz Boas (1858-1942) denounced social evolutionism and the idea of universal laws that govern human cultures, not enough data to make such generalizations.
		- Focus on the historicity of archaeological cultures and the functionalist aspects of their societies (adaptation to environments)
2. **Culture Historical Appreach** (1900-1950)
	 - Created reliance on Archaeological Cultures with little basis in reality
	 - Common to refer to collections of artifacts from one site or period as "cultures" (problematic, broadly generalizing based on style)
	 - Plays into nationalist narratives that can be distorted for political gain (seeking evidence for the glorious past of their country)
		 - German archaeologists excavated sites and interpreted them to legitimize fascist and racist ideas about the past
	 - Surge in archaeological interest led to new excavation techniques and theoretical orientations
3. **Processual Approach** (1950-1980)
	 - Looks to remove bias through positism (objective and quantitative) at the expense of history
	 - Positism: Every rational assertation can be justified with scientific or mathematical proof
		 - Advent of radiocarbon dating in 1950 helped advance this
	 - Turned quantitative and researchers tried again looking for universal laws of human nature in the past, began looking at artifacts as external means of human adaptation to their environments
	 - Celebration of human diversity and individuality suppressed into numbers and equations
		 - Paid more attention to mechanisms of social evolution at the expense of understanding people and social history
4. **Postprocessual Approach** (1980-Present)
	 - Reaction against positivism in the last approach due to lack of human agency
	 - Relativism, want to see the past in its own terms. Moved away from generalization and mathematical laws of human nature
		 - Social and Marxist archaeologies developed along with fringe philosophies (phenomenology)
	 - Problem: these studies insist there are many ways to interpret the past, no one way is correct.
		 - The real past is unknowable
		 - Some studies relied little on actual data, instead turned to philosophy, social theory
	 - Today:
		 - Use social archaeology to talk about gender, inequality, landscape development, effects of heritage on modern populations
		 - Qualitative studies that produce narratives
		 - New processualism to talk about cognitive developments, social complexity, methods of sociocultural selection over time. Quantitative studies to test hypotheses
		 - Focus on using material culture to talk about the past contextually and interpretively

### Analogy and Ethnographic Present
 - Make comparisons between the material record of living societies and the archaeological record of past societies
 - Must be cautious, modern biases to infuence how we think about the past. People in the past didn't have the same values or beliefs

### Cultural Process (Cultural Change)
 - Have the tools and data to explain how change occurs
 - Changes over time were cumulative and slow, resulted from adjusting and evolving responses to internal (social) and external (environmental) feedbacks
 - Look at how people survived and made a living in the past
	 - Study subsistence (procurement and consumption of food) and the environment (paleoenvironmental reconstruction)
 - Societies are complex, no one factor is responsible for cultural change

### Mechanisms of Culture Change
 - **Inevitable Variation**: 
	 - Difference in learned behaviour changes between generations
	 - Can be minor, snowball over time
 - **Invention**:
	 - Some inventions are unique, others spread between regions
	 - Similar things can be invented independently (farming)
 - **Diffusion**:
	 - Ideas and material culture can spread between regions without the mass movements of peoples
	 - Trade, marriage, diplomacy, etc
 - **Migration**:
	 - People moving deliberately to expand their influence
	 - Can be small (new site is settled) or large (colonization efforts)

### Culture as Adaptation
 - Mechanism are descriptive, how do we explain cultural change?
 - Part of Processual Archaeology, culture as adaptation
	 - Suite of technologies and beliefs that societies use to adapt to their circumstances
 - Multilineal Cultural Evolution: Each individual culture has its own evolutionary course determined by long-term success of adaptations
 - Multilineal evolution shows that the most important differences between cultures are those pre-state or state-organized societies
|Membership|Number of People|Settlement Pattern|
|---|---|---|
|Band|Dozens and Up|Mobile|
|Tribe|Hundreds and Up|Mobile or Fixed, 1+ Villages|
|Chiefdom|Thousands and Up|Fixed, 1+ Villages|
|State|10ks and Up|Fixed, Many Villages and Cities|

### Cultural Traditions
 - Interactions and relationships between people in the past are what creates cultures that appear to adapt and change over time
 - Cultural traditions emerge to help societies cope with their circumstances
 - Other traditions are more idiosyncratic and haphazard, hard to understand archaeologically as they are less patterned, more influenced by ideologies, beliefs
	 - Can often only guess at beliefs and motivations, often need texts to help understand

### Current Trends
- Increasing interest in global prehistory: Questions of gender and the incorporation of indigenous perspectives for understanding the past
- Archaeology has been dominated by men, Women have only been involved in large part since the 1980s
- Highlight indigenous knowledge in critiquing western civilization, understanding pre-state societies
