### Upper Paleolithic
 - Two important changes: modern humans in Europe, Aurignacian industry
 - Neanderthals v Humans: Shorter, more robust, pronounced brow, evolved parallel to us, no interactions in middle east
 - Spread of H. sapiens out of Africa occurs on **Crossroads of Eurasia**
 - **Locations**:
	 - Qafzeh and Skhul caves: Evidence for early h. sapiens, incised flint, levallois tools, buried individuals
	 - Bacho Kiro Cave: Evidence humans moved north, supports Out of Africa
 - Three hypotheses for the disappearance of Neanderthals (27 kya):
 - **Out of Africa:** Humans invaded Europe, killed/outcompeted Neanderthals
	 - Supported by fossil evidence, humans moved north, Neanderthals unchanged
	 - Strongly supported by Genetic Evidence, Neanderthal genome mapped, people living outside Africa derive very small DNA percentage from Neanderthals
 - **Hybridization:** Humans invade, Neanderthals bred out
	 - Lagar Velho Child: Skeletal human w/ Neanderthal aspects, could have just been robust little dude
	 - Supported by Chatelperronian industry
 - **Multiregional:** Gene flow between hominins, Neanderthals evolved locally into modern humans
	 - Overlap between humans and neanderthals is problematic, distinct species w/ no genetic mixing
	 - Least likely
 - **Archaeological Industry**: Looking for material culture transition between Mousterian and Aurignacian
	 - Szeletian industry: Eastern Europe, bifacial points
	 - Ulluzian industry: Italy, arched-backed knives, bone points
	 - **Chatelperronian industry**: Bone tools, look like later Aurignacian (human) but users were Neanderthals
		 - Chatelperronian and Aurignacian people lived at the same time, interaction occurred, Neanderthals copied Humans

### Aurignacian Industry
 - Earliest true Upper Paleolithic industry. More blades, advanced bone tools, personal adornment, first artwork, earliest music
	 - Bone tools show standardized repetitive forms, far more frequent than ever before
	 - First period of personal ornamentation, pendants and beads
 - **Blades**: Levallois or Prismatic Cores (more common), many retouched tools from blades
 - **Prismatic Core**: Human technology, core with flat edge, arris created, blades are chipped off the circumference ![[prismatic_core.png|100]]
 - **Animal Figurines**: 12 figurines carved out of ivory, earliest example of human 3d art
	 - Lion-Human of Hohlenstein: Oldest statue ever made, lithic blade to make humanoid with head of lion
	 - Vogelherd Human-Like Figurine: Ivory cylinder with circular end as the head, covered in dots
	 - Geissenklosterle Ivory Plate: Ivory plate depict human w/ outstretched arms, backside notched w/ dots
	 - Venus of Hohle Fels: Oldest venus, voluptuous female characteristics
 - **Subsistence**: Big game, not much vegetation, fish, birds. 
	 - Fewer animals on site, more individual hunting = less opportunism, greater planning
	 - Changes in subsistence economy (little more diverse) more about equipment used rather than animals hunted
 - **Settlements**: Warming climate allow exposed areas, higher mobility, more special purpose camps
 - **Exchange**: Evidence for long distance trade, more structured social relationships

### Gravettian Industry
 - Much finer blades and technology, many types of stone tools (mostly blunt backed blades), burins more abundant, lack of certain bone/antler artifacts, lack of steep/nosed scrapers, many differences suggest these two cultures were different populations
	 - First time with ground stone technology, large grinding stones in Ukraine/Russia
	 - Earliest evidence for **ceramic manufacture**, barriers (windbreaks+drains), no pots due to basket weaving
	 - Time to develop these crafts, werent entirely nomadic
 - **Subsistence**: Lots of variation depending on location. Big game hunting with spears, small game with nets
 - **Settlement**: Definitive huts, wooden/bone frameworks, rocks to hold down hides as tents, some were massive
 - **Exchange**: Evidence for considerable distances, motivated by adornment, social/economic safety nets (relations > goods)
 - **Clay Figurines**: Dolni Vestonice, Czech Republic: 6000 clay pieces found, for ritual performance of hunting magic/divination
	 - Venus of Dolni Vestonice: Larger and more detailed figuring
	 - Venus of Brassempouy: Head of woman wearing a headdress
	 - Venus of Willendorf: Chubby, impressions around the head
 - **Burial**: Most single burials with deceased covered in red ochre + grave goods, Sungir burial in russia

### Solutrean Industry
 - Last glacial maximum (polar desert in north, populations plummeted), huge number of well-made stone points (mostly leaf points, spearheads)
	 - Endscrapers are common, burins very rare, thinnest + best stone tools of the entire stone age (mastery of pressure flaking)
	 - Atlatl was invented (spear thrower)
	 - Regional groups emerge to compete for diminishing resources
 - **Solutre**: Open-air site at the base of cliff, mass animal drives, mostly horses killed here, more meat than needed and wasted
 - **Subsistence**: Reindeer is the main food source (horses only at Solutre), less large game due to environment, more diversification to cope w/ declining environment, exchange networks continued to operate
 - **Art and Ritual**: Pendents, beads, bracelets of bone and ivory. Red+yellow ochre, black manganese for paint, no burials

### Epigravettian Industry
 - Italy, Balkans, Moravia. Gravettian stone tools, very thin traces
 - **Largest Change**: Storage pits dug into the permafrost, intensive hunting in fall for winter storage, larger groups could survive

### Magdalenian Industry
 - End of the ice age, gradual warming, herbs and grasses in tundra+steppes, trees expand, forest grazers flourish, no mammoths
 - Huge numbers of blades and bladelets, burins, backed blades set into bone/antler (composite tools)
	 - Numerous bone points (barbed), harpoons
 - **Badegoulian**: Lower Magdalenian in SW France, short lived culture, transitionary between Solutrean and Magdalenian
 - **Subsistence**: Big herbivores as majority, small mammals, birds, fish begin to play larger roles through time
	 - By Upper Magdalenian very diversified and efficient: Bow and arrow, Domesticated dogs for hunting
 - **Settlement**: Nearly half are open-air for the first time, new site locations of low-lying caves in rover bottoms and close to river fjords (taking advantage of migration paths, fishing)
 - **Structures**: Huts known at many Magdalenian sites, many huts of variable location suggest seasonal hunting strategies
	 - Etiolles, 6m diameter stone circle, some sites (Pincevent) had 100 rings
 - **Exchange**: Isturitz and Mas d'Azil (in Pyrenees): Supersites of huge cave complexes, huge assemblages (storehouses), stone and shells from very far away
 - **Portable Art**: Explosion of artistic activity, utilitarian tools being decorated, ornaments being manufactured
 - **Cave Art**: Most examples from Pyrenees, hand stencils, geometric designs, animal depictions
	 - Mostly bigger animals instead of economically important reindeer
	 - Most decorated caves likely ritual centers or sanctuary sites (Chauvet Cave)
 - **Burials**: Most burials in this period, flexed or straight burials, grave goods, defleshed bones, replaced eyes, social inequality?
 - **End**: Warmer climate, people spread over Europe into new areas, reindeer migration, bow > atlatl, adornment declination

### Southeast Asia and Oceana
 - Dhaba on Son River in Northern India: Bridge linking stone tools between Africa and Australia
 - H.erectus in China and Java, unsure about H.sapiens, increase in brain size and stone tools
 - When sea levels were low:
	 - **Sahul**: Connects Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea
	 - **Sunda**: Connects Southeast Asia
	 - **Wallacea**: String of islands connecting Sahul and Sunda -> Wallace Line, crossed by low sea levels and favourable currents
		 - Stone tools found on island of Flores in Wallacea, suggests H. erectus could cross water, unlikely to be boats
 - Homo Floresiensis: Smallest human species, Indonesian Hobbits, long term isolation -> small bodies
 - Crossing Wallacea to Sahul: Northern route and southern route, southern is more direct but 90 km sea crossing
 - Megafauna Extinction: End of Pleistocene, likely human activity altered ecology detrimentally to megafauna
 - Rock Art: Traditions expressed in artwork, most famous of Ubirr rock shelter in Kakadua National Park (Northern Australia)
 - Lapita Culture: Left Taiwan, rapid colonization, inheritence social structure, leave home to create lineages

### America
 - **#1 Clovis First Model**: New leaf-shaped projectile point, flute extend down the body
	 - Earliest large scale occupation of Americas, resemble Solutrean points but better to absorb shock of hitting bone
 - **Beringia**: Bering Strait between Siberia and Alaska, how ancestors first crossed into NA
	 - Expect to find fluted points in either place before oldest Clovis sites, dont appear until long after Clovis people
 - **Clovis Culture**: Flute tech is American, no evidence for built features on Clovis
	 - Upward Sun River, Alaska: Double infant burial: Red ochre, 3 bifacial points (!clovis), 4 antler rods
		 - Grave goods suggest infant had inherited social status, two infants had different mothers
 - **#2 Pre-Clovis Model**: Evidence is growing (early claims dismissed)
	 - Best example: **Meadowcroft Rockshelter**, Pennsylvania, assemblage from pre clovis
	 - Problem that carbon contaminated by older samples carried through groundwater from nearby coal beds
 - **Monte Verde**: Greatest challenger to Clovis-First, objects 1.5k before Clovis, extraordinary organic preservation in peat
	 - Controversy: Doubted, much hostility and criticism, now widely accepted
	 - Can only say there is some evidence pre clovis, unlikely to be widescale or successful
	 - Excavators suggest the broken stones are natural, not flaked
 - **Caverna de Pedra Pintada**: Site in Brazilian Amazon, same time as Clovis, plants and fish instead of megafauna
 - **#3 Early Arrival Model**: Some people could have arrived 50 kya (13 kya is Clovis), very unlikely, radiocarbon -> 3 kya
 - **Pedra Furada**: Burnt patches of soil with broken rock, critics suggest they are natural brush fires with rock fallen off cliff
 - **Cerutti Mastodon Site**: Broken mammoth bone, possible driven over by a truck instead of ancient peoples
 - **Solutrean Hypothesis**: Upper Paleolithic crossed on sea ice and settled in eastern US
	 - Enormously difficult and illogical, no evidence for seafaring, no other Solutrean cultural evidence
	 - White supremacists can claim white Europeans were original settlers of North America
 - **Folsom People**: Clovis ended abruptly, became Folsom
	 - Mass kill sites emerge, Folsom points are the most sophisticated ever produced (razor sharp, long flute)
	 - First mound builders, Watson Brake Mound in Louisiana predates Stonehenge, reconsider simplicity of hunter-gatherers

### Anthropocene
 - Homo Sapiens, fastest and most transformative changes, social complexity by agricultural surplus & social differentiation
 - Anthropocene begins with nuclear revolution in 1950s, rooted in physical form, peak intellectual capacity, complex social forms
 - Brain size rapidly increased during climate fluctuations, language ready brain and availability of a linguistic code
 - Phenology: Seasonal builogical events in plant/animal species, recorded in abstract marks (writing)

### Early Mesolithic
 - After younger dryas temperature in Europe rose rapidly
 - Preboreal -> Boreal -> Atlantic, increasing amounts of temperatures and trees
 - Cultures and Facies (stratigraphic layers) assigned to Mesolithic based on sites, regions, vegetations, stone tools
 - Period of the microlith, best preserved: Loshult Arrow in Sweden (peat bog) -> Ronneholm Arrow
 - One new artifact in North Europe: Chipped Stone Axe (Tranchet Axe)
 - **Microburin Technique**: Microliths, notch made in blade and then snapped before being retouched
 - **Deer Antler Headdresses**: Deer skull w/ antlers, holes drilled into skull, headgear
	 - 6 found in Star Carr in peat bog (anaerobic) along with many pendants and beads
 - **Subsistence**: Deer, elk, using hunting dogs, diversification as small mammals and fishing are abundant, regular plant foods
 - **Settlement**: Small and highly mobile, some larger sites, most stayed in 100km zones and traded with nearby groups (no long distance)
 - **Burials**: Undisturbed burials uncommon, grave goods almost entirely absent, butterfly posture of remains
 - **Art and Adornment**: Engraving bone and antler tools, barbed line technique
