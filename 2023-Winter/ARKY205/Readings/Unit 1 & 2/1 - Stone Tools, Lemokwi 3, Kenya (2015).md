### 3.3-million-year-old stone tools from Lomekwi 3, West Turkana, Kenya
https://www-nature-com.ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/articles/nature14464.pdf

### Forward
 - Assumption early stone tools made by genus Homo, directly linked to climate change and spread of savannah grasslands
 - Fieldwork in West Turkana, Kenya, identified evidence of earlier hominin technology
	 - Lomekwi 3, 3.3m year old site where *in situ* stone artefacts occur, temporal association with Pliocene hominin fossils in wooded palaeoenvironment
	 - "Lomekwian" tools, predating Oldowan tools by 700k years

### Lomekwi 3 Site
 - Low hill eroded into by a small ravine
 - Plaque of slope deposits, layers of sands, granules, silts are underneath
 - Artifacts have many different sizes, and many are larger and heavier than could be carried by the system that deposited the sediments, only exhibiting slight abrasion

### Technology of the Stone Tools
 - Cores (of heavy and large sized cobbles, to produce flakes)
 - Flakes (whole and broken)
 - Passive elements/Potential anvils
 - Percussors (whole and broken)
 - Extra artifacts of indeterminate fragments, pieces lacking diagnostic attributes
 - Cobbles and blocks were all available locally, the largest were consistently selected.
 - Significant knapping accidents happened during flaking, visible on cores
	 - Flakes were intentionally knapped from the cores
	 - Passive pieces show similar wear and fracture patterns, associations with crushing marks and concentration of impact damage on a single horizontal surface

### Discussion
 - Knappers were able to deliver sufficient intentional force to repeatedly break flakes off of the cores, before rotating or flipping the cores to break more
 - Percussive impacts were poorly controlled, lots of failed blows
	 - Still indicate that the motor control of the user was substantial
 - Use of different objects for several distinctive tasks, technological diversity much older than previously acknowledged

### Methods
**Paleomagnetic Analyses:**
 - Hand-cut blocks measured, recorded, and extracted from the ground
 - Cut into standard cubes for lab analysis
 - Natural Remanent Magnetization (NRM) was subjected to progressive Thermal Demagnetization (TD)
	- Heat is applied from 100-700 C over 17 steps
	- Magnetic usceptibility values determined initially and after each TD step
**Pedogenic Carbonate Stable Carbon Isotope Analysis:**
 - Can't read this
**Site Scanning:**
 - Frequent 3D scans of the site
 - Hand scans, industrial 3D scanner
	 - After the scan, 3D photo was taken to be draped around the can
	 - High resolution 3D digital model was created for the entire site
**Stone Tool Scanning:**
 - Representative sample of each artifact was scanned at the National Museums of Kenya, Turkana Basin Institute facility in Turkwel
