### End of the Ice Age
 - After 18000 BP, last glacial maximum
	 - Now period of variable but gradual warming
 - Herbs and grasses productive in tundra and steppes
	 - Tree's expand, forest grazers flourish while others (mammoths) suffer
	 - Mammoths suffer nutritional stress, by 12000 BP no more mammoths :(
 - Between 16-15 kya, human groups begin expanding north out of Franco-Cantabrian glacial refuge

### Magdalenian Culture
 - Most spectacular of the Upper Paleolithic
	 - Economic innovation, complex social interactions, elaborate art and rituals
 - Characterized by huge numbers of blades and bladelets, burins, backed blades inset into bone/antler
	 - Composite tools
	 - Composite projectile points were an important innovation, emerge by Middle Magdalenian (14-13k BP)
 - Numerous bone points, barbed to detach into wounds, harpoons
 - Magdalenian culture in western Europe, Epigravettian culture continued in eastern Europe and Italy

### First Magdalenians: Badegoulian
 - Lower Magdalenian phase of SW France renamed to Badegoulian Interlude
 - Short-lived culture with flake tools, star-shaped borers, wide "raclette" scrapers, no bladelets
 - Transitionary between later Solutrean and true Magdalenian people
	 - Increasing flexibility in lithic production and specialization

### Magdalenian Subsistence
 - Period of harsh environments with some warming trends
 - Similar to Solutrean: Big herbivores make up 91-100% of faunal assemblages
	 - Mostly reindeer and horse, evidence for growing diversification of animals
 - As the period developed, small mammals, birds, fish begin to play larger roles as food resources for the first time
 - By Upper Magdalenian: Subsistence economies are very diversified and efficient
	 - Introduction of the bow and arrow
	 - Dogs may have been domesticated, aid in hunting

### Magdalenian Settlement
 - During Badegoulian, nearly half of known sites are open-air for the first time
 - Sites expanded out of Franco Cantabrian glacial refuge into SW France, then rest of Europe
 - New site locations are chosen. Low-lying caves in river bottoms and sites close to river fords
	 - Taking advantage of reindeer migration paths, fishing locales?

### Magdalenian Structures
 - Huts are known at many Magdalenian sites
 - Well-known example: Etiolles, 6 m diameter stone circle surrounding hearth and artifacts
	 - Some sites, Pincevent, had 100 such rings
 - Presence of so many huts with variable locations suggest seasonal hunting strategies

### Magdalenian Exchange
 - Exchange networks continue to expand
 - Two sites in the Pyrenees: Isturitz and Mas d'Azil
	 - Well studied, stone and shells from very far away, complex web of interconnections
	 - Supersites, huge cave complexes with river tunnels and wall art
	 - Huge assemblages, may have stored as storehouses (stone and antler), meeting places, ritual centers

### Magdalenian Portable Art
 - Explosion of artistic activity
	 - Around 80% of all known Upper Paleolithic portable art projects from this period
 - Find both utilitarian tools (spear throwers) being decorated along with ornaments being manufactured
	 - Venus figurines also continue
 - Spear throwers have the most spectacular designs, huge variety in subjects
	 - Animals in motion, non-big game animals (salmon), geometric designs
 - Examples: Engrave stone plaquettes (most common), perforated antler batons, engraved bone disks

### Magdalenian Cave Art
 - Most impressive and celebrated art form, 90% of known examples come from Pyrenees area in France, Spain
	 - Black, Red, Yellow pigments
	 - Hand stencils
	 - Geometric designs, impressive animal depictions
 - Reindeer are more economically important, few are depicted
	 - Mostly bison, horses, aurochs, mammoths
 - Dating is very difficult, AMS radiocarbon dating allows more precision
 - Some patterns emerge, female anatomy appear central, male designs are peripheral
 - Most decorated caves were likely ritual centers or sanctuary sites
	 - Chauvet Cave with Skull Chamber (altar w/ bear skull, altar below painted bears)
	 - Child footprints suggest initiation rites

### Magdalenian Burials
 - 85% of all known burials from the Upper Paleolithic
 - Flexed or straight burials, grave goods of tools, bone, ornaments
	 - Other burial styles: Detached skulls with replaced eyes in special chambers
	 - Many human bones show evidence for defleshing
 - Saint-Germain-la-Riviere: Young woman placed flexed on her side, accompanied with animal bones and beads. Slabs placed around her suggest she was important
	 - Social inequality?

### End of the Magdalenian
 - Franco-Cantabrian region is likely complex due to glacial refuge
 - People came here to escape ice, interactions + competition intensified with regional styles emerging
 - Climate ameliorated around 11500 BP start of Holocene, Magdalenian people spread back over central and northern Europe into new areas
	 - Reindeer migrated far north, Europeans shifted to hunting forest game like deer and boar
	 - Spear throwers used less, bow becomes main hunting tool
 - Portable artwork and adornment decline into Mesolithic

### Southern Europe
 - Upper Paleolithic Italy: Oscillating climate, rising sea levels flooded the Adriatic causing many local animals to become extinct
 - Maintained Epigravettian tool industries, some backed bladelets and end scrapers at the period end

### Eastern Europe
 - Russian Plane, Ukraine continuously occupied glacial refuge like Franco-Cantabrian
 - Mostly grasslands, mammoths until 12k BP
 - Epigravettian, large sites like Magdalenian, each with internal hearth and external hearths
 - Decorative items, plus oldest map in the world (14k BP)
 - Exchange was complex, stone tools similar across the whole region
	 - Status differentiation by hut sizes and storage pits

### Northern Europe
 - Magdalenian cultures from the west, Epigravettian cultures from the east expanded north during Allerod
 - Last glacial period had one cold period left: Younger Drays (12900 to 11700 BP), small period of extreme climate oscillation forcing regional variations of Magdalenian lifeways
 - Stellmoor, northern Germany: Ahrensburgian culture, over 100 arrow shafts, oldest examples in Europe

### Summarizing the Upper Paleolithic
 - 40k to 10k BP
	 - Appearance of fully modern humans in Europe
	 - Perfection of prismatic blades, bladelets, microliths, introduction of pressure flaking
	 - New ways to work antler and bone
	 - Systematic food storage
	 - Appearance of cordage,  maybe nets, first eyed needle
	 - First use of fired clay
	 - Invention of spear thrower, then the bow and arrow
	 - Economic specialization and diversification (reindeer, increasing fish, birds, shellfish)
	 - More energy in construction and planning
	 - Increase in exchange
	 - Explosion in art, maybe communal rituals
 - Developments were episodic and patchy, not gradual
	 - Responses to stressful conditions
	 - Another sign: Upper Paleolithic peoples were shorter than Middle Paleolithic, Mesolithic
