### Defining Complexity
 - Today: Institutionalized power in government, police, law, ownership, is a fact of life
	 - Almost entirely linked by centralized authority, economic inequality, concentration of wealth
 - None of this was true for almost all of human existance, these states exist through growing complexity
 - Emergence of these state societies was a major event in human adaptation
 - We use civilization as a shorthand for urbanized state-level societies
	 - Not civilized vs barbaric
 - States have the following features:
	 - Societies based on cities with large complex social organization and large territories
	 - Economies based on the centralized accumulation of capital and social status
	 - Advances toward formal record keeping, science, mathematics, some kind of written script
	 - Impressive public buildings and monumental architecture
	 - Some form of all-embracing state religion where the ruler plays a leading role
 - **Political Complexity**:
	 - Why did people go from small Neolithic farming communities to massive cities with centralized authority, weath inequality, forced labbour?
	 - Many point to political complexity, assumption that as populations get bigger they need more complicated governmental structures
		 - Core issue: Legitimacy, why/when were states granted authority over their subjects
		 - Consensus or coercion? Often a mix of both
	 - Gordon V Childe saw the origins of the city as part of an Urban Revolution

### Defining Cities
 - Not controversial: Cities are a part of state-level societies
	 - Earliest cities were not all the same
 - Complexity of ancient cities makes them difficult to define and study archaeologically
 - Arbitrary criteria:
	 - Large and dense settlement of at least thousands of people
	 - Show evidence for internal specialization between rural hinterland and other cities
		 - Central place for services for the countryside, depends on rural world for food
	 - Degree of organizational complexity beyond small farming communities

### Ladders of Political Complexity
 - Attempted to place state societies in systems of growing evolutionary complexity. Find models of commonalities in how political complexity develops
 - Morton Fried (1967): Four types of societies:
	 - Egalitarian: Differences between members based n skill at subsistence activities, age, gender.
		 - Production is household level, exchange based on reciprocity
	 - Ranked: Fewer positions of prestige, status in birth order rather than ability
		 - No hierarchy, no real political power or exploitation. Leaders collect and redistribute, not expropriate and consume
	 - Stratified: All people don't have access to key resources, access linked with prestige
		 - Growth of explotation, organization based on communities vs houses/kin groups
	 - State: Power is based on supra-kin basis, task of using power to maintain hierarchy through borders, legal systems, police, taxation, conscription
 - Fried saw the evolution of political complexity as a gradual process. Units of organization shifted from kin groups to supra-king communities
 - Elman Service (1971) made similar scheme shortly after. (Bands, Tribes, Chiefdoms, States)
	 - Bands and Tribes roughly correspond to Fried's egalitarian and ranked societies
	 - Chiefdoms have hereditary leadership, little ability to use force to maintain order
	 - States: Use government and law backed by the threat of force. Legitimate monopoly over the use of force to maintain order over large populations
 - Both emphasize emergence of inequality, movement of authority from kin to supra-kin

### Six Classic Theories for the Emergence of States
**1. Childe's Urban Revolution**:
 - Urban Revolution kicked off development of complexity and statehood
 - Development of craft specialization and technology was the cornerstone of the Urban Revolution
	 - Specialization in crafts requires surplus from other specialized crafts, way to order it all
 - Problem: Specialized artisans appear in other contexts, not just emerging states
 - Correlation between appearance of full-time craft specialization and civilization
 - Point: Craft specialization is a sign of state formation, not its cause
	 - Predicting urbanization by surplus production doesn't explain why surplus was generated
**2. Ecology and Irrigation**:
 - Three elements of Childe's model thought to have great importance: Large food surpluses, Diversified farming economies, Irrigation agriculture
 - Ecological Potential of River Floodplains: Theory reasons that floodplains and fertile soils of the Nile and Mesopotamia explained why civilizations began there
	 - Specialized ecosystems mixed with high population densities responsible for states
	 - Doesn't explain Inca and Minoans
	 - Did surplus food lead to higher populations, or did higher populations lead to surplus food?
 - Ecological Diversity of Local Environments: Diversified agricultural societies relied on fewer, more productive crops, but had a wide subsistence base
	 - Resulting diversity of food resources protected people from famine and stimulated trade
	 - This saw development of distributive institutions which encouraged a central authority
 - Adoption of Irrigation Agriculture: Use of irrigation allow for better crop yields, population densities
	 - Societies who had advanced forms of irrigation needed state-level organization to dig and maintain them, while also having the surplus to support massive populations
	 - Problem: In Mesopotamia, major communities ived by the water and had their own irrigation systems that required no administrative supervision
**3. Technology and Trade**:
 - Irrigation technology was important, not everywhere, usually not until states already established
 - Technology was dissemitated through trade
	 - Trade requires goods/commodities being exchanged and people to make the trade through an exchange system (gift exchange, bartering, redistribution)
 - Every year more archaeology is discovered that modifies views on ancient trade
 - Modern Theories: Trade can't be a unifying factor of civilization, no part of exchange systems had primary causation over cultural change
 - What we see: Extensive long-distance trade is a consequence rather than cause of civilization
**4. Warfare**:
 - Coercive Theory (Robert Carneiro): Good agricultural land was rare (in Peru), autonomous villages fought each other for territory until one was successful in dominating the others
 - Archaeology shows no sign of autonomous villages
	 - Instead shows complex evolving settlements over centuries
	 - Only coercive processes in 400 CE, long after complex societies
**5. Environmental Change**:
 - New theories: Many civilizations arose in periods of environmental changes
 - Problem: Hypothetical, no way to prove it
**6. Complex Systems Theory**:
 - 1. Urban life and civilization emerged gradually, 2. Linear explanations are inadequate
 - Turn to intricate, nonlinear systems models to explain the rise of civilization
	 - Nothing emerged first and can be pointed out as causation
 - Results of interacting variables are always random, history has no direction
