### Mesolithic
 - Mostly European term, literature sometimes refers to this period as the Epipaleolithic
 - Begins at the onset of the Holocene 11650 BP with full postglacial climate conditions
 - After Younger Dryas, temperature in Europe rose rapidly
 - Receding glaciars deposited clay, sand, gravel, along with depressions to form lakes
 - Land became colonized by plants expanding from glacial refugia in three phases:
|Phase|Time|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Preboreal|10300-8700 BP|Modern temperatures, pioneer trees colonize, birch and pine dominate|
|Boreal|8700-8000 BP|Warmer and drier than today, increase in hazel and deciduous trees|
|Atlantic|8000-5000 BP|Max temperatures with more precipitation, oak forests develop in higher and drier elevations, Europe remains grasslands with tree|
 - More Mesolithic sites are known archaeologically than the Upper Paleolithic
 - Unlike Upper Paleolithic, most Mesolithic sites are open-air camps
	 - Difficult to understand site activities and land use patterns

### Site Preservation
 - Interpretation falls mostly to few excavations where organic material was preserved (caves, peat bogs, edges of lakes)
	 - More common in Northern Europe
	 - Anaerobic environment, extraordinary preservation
 - As the ice sheets melted and sea levels rose, large portion of lowland plain (Doggerland) was flooded
 - Early Mesolithic: England still not an island, Dogger Bank likely home for Mesolithic cultures

### Mesolithic Cultures
 - Facies: distinct stratigraphic layers
 - Cultures and Facies assigned to Mesolithic based on site locations, regions, vegetation, stone tools
 - Unclear if these divisions represent real distinct social groups or just functional groups based on subsistence strategy

### Early Mesolithic Technology
 - Early Mesolithic is the period of the microlith
	 - Seen before, more widely used
 - Best preserved example: Loshult Arrow in Sweden (peat bog)
	 - Recently: Ronneholm Arrow
 - Like earlier Magdalenian: used with bows and likely spears
 - Assemblages similar to Magdalenian examples
 - One new artifact only in Northern Europe: Chipped Stone Axe (Tranchet Axe)
	 - Absence of tool further souch, likely forests of northern Europe were smaller and easier to fell than the larger harder trees of the south
	 - Shape of axe (round rectangle?) is an important tool in Neolithic Europe

### Microburin Technique
 - Unique technique for making microliths
 - Notch made in a blade and then snapped, resulting break is further retouched
 - Variety of shapes are possible, changing shapes patterned through time, rough chronology

### Deer Antler Headdresses
 - Deer skull with antlers, two holes drilled into the skull
 - Portions of skull deliberately cut away to reduce weight
 - Headgear, unknown functions, possible hunting disguises or a shaman's costume
 - Only present in bog sites, impossible to determine how common they were
 - Star Carr: Early Mesolithic site, demonstrates value of well-preserved anaerobic sites
	 - 6 headdresses found here
	 - Wooden posts and planks to construct a dry trackway
	 - No boats found, likely they had them and fishing was important
	 - What are we missing from dryland sites?

### Worlds Oldest Boat
 - Pesse canoe, Netherlands, oldest radiocarbon dated boat in the world
	 - 10040-10510 BP, very start of Mesolithic
 - Dugout canoe formed from a single scots pine log
 - Bouyancy originally questioned, replica in early 2000s proved its utility

### Early Mesolithic Subsistence
 - Relied on red deer, boer, roe deer, with some big game like elk and aurochs
	 - Use of dogs may have been useful
 - Diversification is evident, small mammals increase in significance
	 - Site of Chateauneuf, more rabbits than any other animal
 - Fishing is abundantly represented, birds and waterfowl also found in quantity
	 - Evidence for marine fish and shellfish, seal bones
 - First good evidence for regular gathering of plant foods
	 - Franchthi Cave, many plants, also known from Italian Mesolithic sites
 - Chemical analysis on human remains from Bois Laiterie (Belgium) suggest one vegetarian individual
 - Why? Reforesting, plant foods becoming more abundant, loss of large game herds

### Early Mesolithic Settlement
 - Abundant sites due to melting of glaciers
 - Didn't last long, isostatic adjustment in the ground lowered some segments, submerging coastal areas like Doggerland
 - Many huts found preserved in peat bogs
	 - Not all were at lakeshores, some open air sites have identified depressions with postholes and hearths
 - Evidence shows Early Mesolithic groups were small and highly mobile
	 - Some larger sites, evidence for repeated occupation over longer periods
 - Scale of movement wasnt great, groups stayed in 100 km zones
 - Stylistic similarities in beads and microliths show overlapping spheres of interaction up to 200 km, open social groups and flexible contacts with neighbouring areas
	 - Long distance trade is lacking

### Early Mesolithic Burials
 - Many sites contain human bone fragments, true undisturbed burials uncommon
 - Single or multiple individuals buried together
 - Remains found extended and flexed (butterfly posture)
 - Grave goods almost entirely absent aside from a few stone tools

### Early Mesolithic Art and Adornment
 - Art and adornment come mostly from European bog sites
	 - Compared to later Mesolithic (and Magdalenian), very few are known
 - Most common form in Denmark: Engraving bone and antler tools
	 - Pendants of bone and amber engraved using barbed line technique
 - Star Carr: Many amber beads and pendants found
	 - Only known shale pendant of the Mesolithic found here
		 - Engraved lines resemble practice in shamanic societies representing kills during hunt, or number of songs needed to be performed after each kill
		 - 11000 BP, oldest piece of portable art ever found in Britain
