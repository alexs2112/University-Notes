### Upper Paleolithic
 - Two important changes (50 kya)
	 - Fully modern humans appear in Europe
	 - Significant changes in stone/bone tools (Aurignacian industry)
 - After 27 kya, Neanderthals disappear form archaeological record
	 - Early humans must have overlapped with them to some degree
	 - What happened to make them extinct

### Skeletal Evidence
 - H. sapiens skulls differ from H. neanderthalensis: Lack pronounced brow, large nose, protruding face
	 - Smaller teeth, larger foreheads, protruding chin
 - Bodies are less robust, more gracile, less pronounced muscle attachments
 - Most Neanderthals appear shorter, but some were tall (if not taller)
 - Neanderthals matured slower but likely lived longer
 - Not much evidence for modern humans from the start of the Upper Paleolithic in Europe
	 - Lots of variation in the few skeletons we do have
	 - Mixture of modern and archaic traits, relationship to Neanderthals, ambiguous evidence

### Crossroads in the Middle East
 - Where did early humans first overlap with Neanderthals? Not Europe
 - Spread of H. sapiens out of Africa occurs on the crossroads of Eurasia, critical role in the origin of modern humans
 - Two sites: Qafzeh and Skhul caves, evidence of early H. sapiens
	 - Stone tools in middle paleolithic fashion (Levallois), no bone tools but buried individuals in shallow graves w/ carefully placed animal bones
	 - One exceptional find from Qafzeh Cave: Incised piece of flint
 - None of the Middle East cave sites from the Paleolithic have evidence for both modern humans and Neanderthals living together
	 - Can't determine their relationship with stratigraphy alone
 - Electron spin resonance, thermoluminescence dating: Neanderthals were not primitive precursors to modern humans, they evolved parallel to us
 - Middle East between both populations (Eurasia and Africa)
	 - Early modern humans moving there between 120 - 80 kya out of Africa
	 - Neanderthal range expanded around 50-60 kya
	 - No evidence the two interacted

### Fate of Neanderthals
 - Three hypotheses:
	 - Out of Africa: Humans invaded Europe and killed/outcompeted Neanderthals to extinction
	 - Hybridization: Humans invaded, Neanderthals werent killed, "bred out"
	 - Multiregional: Gene flow between hominins, Neanderthals evolved locally into modern humans

### Fossil Evidence
 - Supports the Out of Africa hypothesis
 - New evidence from Bulgaria at Bacho Kiro Cave, human bone fragments are 45 kya
	 - Humans moved north
 - At the same time European Neanderthal skeletons DO NOT show any tendency towards modern human traits
 - Persistence of Neanderthals and their overlap with humans is problematic for multiregional hypothesis
	 - Species appear distinct for a long time with no genetic mixing
	 - Not as problematic for hybridization hypothesis, predicts that some later skeletons should show a mixture of traits to suggest interbreeding
		 - Best example: Lagar Velho child, skeletal traits on children are hard to prove and it could have just been a robust H sapiens child, not a neanderthal

### Genetic Evidence
 - Strong support for Out of Africa hypothesis
 - More confusion: Neanderthal genome was mapped due to preserved organic material
	 - results suggest that people living outside Africa derive 1-4% of their DNA from Neanderthals with gene flow occurring between 37 and 86 kya
	 - Hybridization hypothesis support

### Archaeological Evidence
 - Looking for material culture that appears transitionary between the Middle (Mousterian) and Upper (Aurignacian) Paleolithic industries
 - Few have been identified:
	 - Szeletian industry, eastern Europe: Bifacial points
	 - Ulluzian industry, Italy: Arched-backed knives and bone points
 - Best documented: Chatelperronian industry from France and northern Spain
	 - Special kind of knife: Chatelperronian point

### Chatelperronian Industry
 - Found collection of ornaments and bone tools in a Chatelperronian level
	 - Grooved and perforated teeth
	 - Small ivory beads
	 - 142 bone tools, including points, awls, pins
 - Look like theyre from the later Aurignacian (human) but all Chatelperronian sites with evidence for hominins (teeth) suggest theyre Neanderthal
 - Most heavily debated industry in all European prehistory
 - In most cases it is found below (older) than Aurignacian strata, in two examples it is found between Aurignacian levels
 - Suggestion: Chatelperronian and Aurignacian peoples lived at the same time in France and northern Spain, overlap of maybe 2-5k years
 - Archaeologically: Interaction ocurred, Neanderthals were copying the behaviour of modern humans in creating these ornaments (no evidence they made them before H. sapien interaction)
 - Hybridizatin hypothesis is plausible

### Conclusion
 - Multiregional hypothesis is least likely, no local evolution of Neanderthals into modern humans
 - Fossil and genetic evidence supports Out of Africa hypothesis, fossils in the Upper Paleolithic are distinctly modern human and did not evolve from Neanderthals
 - Archaeological evidence supports the Hybridization hypothesis, arrival of humans did not result in immediate disappearance of Neanderthals
