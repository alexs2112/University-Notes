[General features of state societies and Friedâ€™s scheme for social evolution]
[Urban Revolution, Ecology and Irrigation, and Technology and Trade models (but not the other 3)]
### Origins of Complexity
 - **State Features**: At least two required to be a state level society, along with control over violence and information
	 - Societies based on cities with complex social organization
	 - Economies to centrally accumulate capital + social status
	 - Formal record keeping, science, mathematics, writing
	 - Public buildings and monumental architecture
	 - State religion where the ruler plays a leading role
 - **Defining Cities**: Large and dense of thousands of people, evidence for internal specialization, organizational complexity
	 - Central place for services in the countryside that depends on rural world for food
 - **Morton Fried (1967): Four Types of Societies**: Units of organization from kin groups to supra-kin communities
	 - Egalitarian: Distinctions of skill at subsistence activities, age, gender. Production is household level, basic exchange
	 - Ranked: Less positions of prestige, status in birth order, no hierarchy or political power, leaders collect + redistribute
	 - Stratified: All people don't have access to key resources, access linked to prestige, growth of exploitation
	 - State: Power based on supra-kin basis, use power to maintain hierarchy, borders, law, police, taxation, conscription
 - **Elman Service (1971)**: Bands, Tribes, Chiefdoms (hereditary leadership, little force), States (monopoly over force for order)
 - **Childe's Urban Revolution**:  Kicked off development of complexity and statehood
	 - Cornerstone: Craft specialization and technology, need way to order specialized craft surplus between professions
	 - Problem: Specialized artisans in other contexts, not just emerging states. Is a sign of state formation, not the cause
 - **Ecology and Irrigation**: Large food surpluses, diversified farming economies, irrigation agriculture
	 - Ecological Potential of River Floodplains: Theory of floodplains, fertile soils of Nile & Mesopotamia started civilization
		 - Specialized ecosystems + high population densities responsible for states, doesn't explain Inca and Minoans
	 - Ecological Diversity of Local Environments: Diversified agriculture relies on fewer productive crops, wider base
		 - Protected from famine, stimulated trade, development of distributive institutions (encourage central authority)
	 - Irrigation Agriculture: Better crop yields, population densities, need state-level organization to dig and maintain
		 - Problem: Mesopotamia, major communities lived by the water, own irrigation without administrative supervision
 - **Technology and Trade**: Tech disseminated through trade, requires exchange system, usually not until states established
	 - Modern Theories: Trade can't be a unifying factor, no exchange systems had primary causation over cultural change
	 - Extensive long-distance trade is a consequence rather than cause of civilization

[Why uruk is a true city, nature of cities in predynastic egypt, differences between egyption + mesopotamian agriculture]
[Name of specific pyramid from a picture of it]
### Earliest States: Mesopotamia
 - Extremely dry, soils needed irrigation, cities were at the edges of extensive marshlands
 - **'Ubaid Origins**: First good evidence for farming, canals for diverting river waters for irrigation, require communal effort
 - **Eridu**: "First City", earliest levels show no evidence for centralized government, started as shrine, rulers not for millenia
 - **Uruk:** The first city, two small towns on opposite banks of a small channel, grew to 2.5 km, population up to 40k
	 - Two massive temple precincts in the middle of the city, limestone temples on massive mudbrick platforms
	 - Gov't: Ruler managed temple & assembly halls, ruled with hierarchy of priests, minor officials, landowners, merchants
		 - Problem: No evidence until after 3500 BCE, Sumerian civ emerged without king or obvious ruler
	 - State: Elaborate management system, 3 sources of authority (ordered by importance): Temple, Palace, City Council
		 - Chief priest ruled the city, palace leader/king/ensi maintained temple and military, selected by city council
	 - Influence grew rapidly due to Writing (cuneiform) and Metallurgy (import copper, gold, ores, start of Bronze Age)
 - **Early Dynastic Period**: Growth by agricultural surplus -> irrigation
	 - 3000 BCE: social stratification, Royal Tombs at Ur with the Death Pits (ritual killings), unsure how kings came to power
 - **Sumerian Colonization**: Militarized society, Uruk colonies all over SW Asia, dynamic power of individual cities + trade

### Earliest States: Egypt
 - **Predynastic Egypt**: 5000 BCE: patchwork of farming communities; 4000 BCE: individual communities compete and trade
	 - Reliance on the Nile, charismatic leaders took advantage of this to justify conquest over neighbours
	 - First Unification: Quick consolidation of power after 4000 BCE
		 - 3500 BCE: 3 kingdoms dominate: Nagada, Nekhen, This (Abydos)
	 - Kingdoms of Upper Egypt had contact with Mesopotamia (artifacts in Egypt), led to conflict, Nekhen prevailed
	 - Military conquest, unification took centuries, 3100 BCE: Upper and Lower Egypt joined (gods Horus + Seth)
 - **Dynasties**: Earliest evidence for single ruler comes from Narmer Palette (Nekhen, Pot shaped flat tablet)
	 - Kingship prevented chaos using power of sun (Ra) to persevere rightness (ma'at), centralized political power
 - **Mortuary Architecture**: Temples for deceased kings who become incarnations of the god Osiris
	 - Unique and distinct (from cities) centers of power, courts of kings sacrificed on death (kinship between elites & king)
 - **First True Pyramids**: King Snefru of the 4th Dynasty (2600 BCE) responsible, construction attempted 3 times
	 - Broken Pyramid at Meydum: Collapsed during construction
	 - Bent Pyramid at Dahshur: Slope of 60* for bottom half, 44* for the top half
	 - Red Pyramid at Dahshur: Successful, 105m high
	 - Tombs at Giza: Pyramid of Khufu: Largest ever built; Great Sphinx: Limestone bedrock during reign of Khafre
	 - [Check lecture pictures of 11.3 for pyramids]

### Egypt vs Mesopotamia
 - **Biggest Difference**: Mesopotamian civilization founded on urban culture, Egyption sought legitimacy from funerary monuments of its kings
 - **Egypt**: Rituals of kingly death reinforced kinship among ruling class, required producing class to provide food for afterlife
	 - All classes tried to imitate royal burial on smaller scales, network of obligations and debt with class distinctions
	 - Relied on the Nile
 - **Mesopotamia**: Early forms of state centered in urban spaces, no obvious rulers, tradition of communal labour + ritual
	 - Complex state before kings even arrive
	 - Needed irrigation, canals diverted water for irrigation and required communal effort

[General question about Harappan cities, one about Harappan cemeteries,  photo of an urban feature to identify city it is in]
### Earliest States: South Asia
 - **Indus Valley**: winds from Himalayas, frequently changes course, Harappan civilization over whole valley and coast of Sea
 - **Harappan Period**: 2600-1900 BCE, several small sites becoming major urban centers, uniform material culture
	 - Common Features: Regular grid patterns; emphasis on hygiene with drains; buildings made of standardized bricks;
	 - Most sites are small villages, only five are larger than 80 ha, best known: Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro
	 - Excavations revealed larger public buildings (speculative as granaries, no evidence)
	 - Most impressive structure: **Great Bath of Mohenjo-Daro**
	 - Internal walls divide into Lower, Middle, Upper areas, incredible finds of large wells, massive water tanks
 - **Harappan Cemeteries**: Buried on backs with simple clay vessels and jewelry, few cases of multiple burials
	 - Rakhigarhi: Most comprehensive cemetery east of Harappa
	 - Include symbolic burials with grave goods and no bodies

[One question about Asian tombs and one about oracle bones]
### Earliest States: China
 -  **Three Dynasties**: Xia, Shang, Zhou: Emerge in North China around 2000-500 BCE, transition from agriculture to state
 - **Anyang**: Capital of Late Shang Dynasty, palace-temple area supported by platforms, arranged in clusters by function
	 - Enormous associated cemetery: Most famous tomb: Fu Hao (wife of king, buried with enormous quantities of goods)
 - **Oracle Bones**: Sold in antiquities markets as dragon bones
	 - Used by Shang kings to predict things like battles or the weather, ask question during ceremony, heated until it cracks, interpret the cracks. 150k oracle bones are known providing info on the lives of Shang Dynasty rulers
	 - Late Shang period: Interpretations are inscribed on the bone, earliest systematic writing from China
 - **Warfare and Consolidation**: Military strength was important, critical to Shang power
	 - Unification under Ying Zheng (first emperor of Qin), tomb with Terracotta Army (8000+ ceramic soldiers), Great Wall
	 - Cemeteries in Taosi show evidence for extreme violence, including mass burials (social revolution?)

[One question about the Olmec carved heads, two about Teotihuacan related to general trivia]
### Earliest States: Mesoamerica
 - **Olmecs**: Oldest Mesoamerican State, largest city in Monte Alban (Oaxaca Valley, 50-350 BCE)
	 - Artistic tradition of monumental stone heads from volcanic rock (prestige in leaders, reverence for ball games)
	 - Also hollow clay sculptures with infant bodies and adult heads representing divinities (16 w/ 6 polished axes)
	 - Speculation: Town hall? Heads of famous ball game winners? Rejection of power of a single ruler?
 - **Teotihuacan**: End of Olmec influence, massive city around year 0
	 - Laid out on single road (Avenue of the Dead) stretching for 5 km, little residential construction (shanty town)
	 - **Monuments**: Pyramid of the Sun, Ciudedala, Temple of Feathered Serpent, Pyramid of the Moon (all ritual killing)
	 - Original inhabitants mixed different ethnic communities (natural disasters caused mass exodus to this center)
	 - Lots of pictoral art, no obvious rulers, rejected other Mesoamerican city politics, largest center at the time
	 - Before 300 CE: Warrior aristocracy ruled the city, organized labour to build the monuments
	 - **Pyramid of the Moon**: Warrior ethos, surrounding pits have evidence for military obsidian workshops
		 - Beyond symbolic, used to produce military supplies, military + ritual parallels
	 - **Destruction of Feathered Serpent Facade**: 400 CE, smashed and replaced, ritual killing at temples appears to cease
		 - Rejection of rule of military members, adoption of communal rule (stone-built housing replaces shanty town)

[Two questions about the cultures preceding the Inca and how they provided the foundations for later Incan imperialism]
### Earliest States: South America
 - Tawantisuyu (four parts) of the Inca Empire: Sate society developed at North coast of Peru, South-central Andes
 - Agriculture remained secondary when the first sedentary villages appear, new concern with religion and cosmos
 - 17 different complex centers emerged around Supe river region, most impressive is El Paraiso
	 - El Paraiso connected with restructuring of society, increase in harvesting root crops, pottery production
 - **Chavin de Huantar**: Temple testimony to elaborate iconography, widespread influence of Chavin material culture
	 - No empire, material culture at the same time as social complexity emerges in the Andes
	 - Lanzon: Jaguar-like human carving as a deity, place of meditation, priests transformed to jaguars and eagles
	 - People of Chavin drew on Amazonia imagery for religious centers (not migrants, charismatic religious leaders?)
	 - Artifacts emphasize transformation, cult rituals practiced 500km from Chavin, spread without conquest or migration
 - **Chiripa**: Small village, platform mound, modified with carved stone plaques of humans and animals (serpents), ancestral to later Tiwanaku architectural tradition
 - **Pukara**: Residential area and ceremonial complex with distinctive pottery style, not found in later Tiwanaku culture
 - **Nazca** (500 BCE-500 CE): Famous for lines and images on coastal desert floor (not sure why)
 - **Moche** (100-800 CE): Ruled by warrior-priests depicted on pots, sacrificed war prisoners, drank blood, dismembered them
	 - Ruler wielded authority over hierarchical state, each valley had one Moche settlement (one valley per ruler), first state
 - Tiwanaku and Wari states were early territorial empires, integrated smaller states into one, constantly trading and warring
 - **Sican**: Extensive Irrigation systems, entered power vacuum left by decline of Moche
 - **Chimu**: Overthrew Sican in 1375, famous for enormous reservoirs, roadways, infrastructure for enormous territorial empire
 - **The Inca**: Emerged after conquering Chimu and all surrounding states, leaders flourished as expert politicians & warriors
	 - Cusi Inca Yupanqui transformed state, developed royal ancestor cult, mummified rulers treated as alive
	 - Machu Picchu: Royal estate of early kings, rulers start with nothing, conquer to accumulate wealth (expansionism)
	 - Ideology was successful: Massive army, conquered all states, passion for organization, administrative language

### Complexity Without the State: North America
**Chaco Canyon**: [Three questions about Chaco Canyon related to dating, territorial power, and Pueblo Bonito architecture]
 - **Ancestral Puebloans**: Emerge in Four Corners region, most famous locale: Chaco Canyon, San Juan Basin of New Mexico
 - **Pueblo Bonito**: Largest Great House in Chaco Canyon. Size suggest political leadership (200k trees, 800k work hours)
	 - Large circular subterranean chambers (Kivas) with religious significance
	 - Dry climate preserved wooden beams in the floor and ceilings, dendrochronology here is remarkably precise
	 - Number of rooms suggest large settlement, but few hearths, little domestic activites
	 - High number of Kivas suggest ceremonial center with low population
		 - originally elite residence, elite power partly derived from role in religious ceremonies
 - **Chacoan Network**: Many Great Houses in Chaco Canyon, most are linked by roads
	 - Chaco Canyon was central location in a wider landscape, goods accumulated due to cycles of feasting when occupied
 - **Mesa Verde**: Small communities emerge here with links to the ceremonial center
	 - Severe drought led to depopulation, many people migrated from Chaco Canyon to Mesa Verde (farming intensified)
	 - Massive multistory buildings emerge (Cliff Palace), stone towers built due to increasing warfare from severe drought
 - **Chaco** was not a town, other Great Houses were equally sparsely occupied with lots of building effort
	 - Powerful leaders, no evidence of control over violence or information, violence due to collapsing society
**Cahokia**: [Cahokian elites and the traits of the SECC]
 - **Mississippian Culture**: Complexity reemerges after end of Hopewell exchange system and loss of long-distance trade
	 - Increased sedentism, growing reliance in maize agriculture and surplus, population growth and concentration
 - **Cahokia**: Largest (hour to walk from end to end) & most famous site, monumental ceremonial complex
 - **Organization**: Monk's Mound, south of Cahokia Creek, north of flattened Grand Plaza, not a city (no administration)
 - **Gov't**: Two sides of debate to understanding political organization:
	 - Powerful chiefdom, elites ruled over other settlements in the American Bottom (almost a state)
	 - Elite of Cahokia simply most powerful group of many competing chiefdoms, power limited to itself, not surroundings
 - **Inequality**: Used to unravel this problem, most vivid evidence at Mound 72, south of Grand Plaza
	 - Hundreds of arrowheads over burial of man on platform of 20k shell beads, other sacrificed individuals buried here
	 - Wealth is concentrated in the hands of few people, elites could call on skilled craftworkers, controlled lives of subjects
 - **Feasting**: Grand Plaza the site of massive social events
	 - Power from elite ability to organize large numbers through feasting rather than bureaucracy and threat of force
	 - Another possibility: Setting for sporting events, polished granite discs in game called Chunky
 - **Religion**: Bird iconography, ritual significance in birds from feasting, buried with more care than other animals
 - **Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC)**: Cultural traits across most of the eastern US included:
	 - Artistic motifs depicting cosmology, supernatural beings of the Above, Middle, Under world
	 - Ubiquity of the birdman symbol in a variety of forms, associated with warfare, games, family dynasty
	 - Red Horn and his sons: Mythic cycle associated with great deeds, tied to peace pipe ceremonies
	 - Great Serpent depicted as creature of Under World at war with Thunderers (birdmen, Above World)
 - **Decline**: Increased warfare, political turmoil, population migrations to other centers (severe social stress due to drought)
	 - Very close to emerging as a state, authority not integrated enough into social and spiritual life

[Pictures of two European artifacts and ask you identify them]
[Meaning behind megaliths]
### Complexity Without the State: Europe
 - **First Farmers in Britain**: Transition happend much later, no archaeological site evidence prior to 4000 BCE
 - **Beginnings of Metallurgy**: 6-4th millenia BC, extensive use of copper, gold, silver
 - **Innovations in Exchange**: Salt: needed with new cereal diets, exploited and traded. Roads: cart track with pictoral evidence
 - **First Writing**: Uruk III script in clay tablets at Tartaria, heavily debated (no administration needed at the time, intrusive)
 - **Settlement Organization**: Greater complexity, not necessarily more sites, expanded due to exhausted soils
 - **Megaliths**: Built mostly by hunter-gatherers, not agriculturalists
	 - Usually refers to burial structures of stone and earth, designed to remain forever, durability and visibility causes reinterpretation throughout the generations
	 - Four different types: Apsidal Temples, Standing Stones (menhirs), Chamber Tomb (dolmen), Swinside Stone Circles
	 - No mortar used: rollers, rope, gravity, trenches, mounds, brute strength were essential. No evidence for how they built
 - **Late Neolithic Social Complexity**: Ranking, diversity + number of megaliths put up shows social distinction
 - **Globular Amphora People**: Extremely round body with 2-4 handles near the neck of the vessel
	 - Victims: Mass grave of 15 people, killed by blows to the head or stone arrows
 - **Corded Ware People**: Knwon as Battle Axe people, frequently buried with military axes (no use as tools)
 - **Bell Beaker People**: Often associated with megaliths, spread extremely quickly, famous warrior archers
	 - Distinctive ceramics, also produced daggers, flat axe heads, halberds
 - **Artifacts**:
	 - Bronocice Pot: Inscribed with possible four-wheeled vehicle
	 - Jemdet Nasr: Square tablet covered in seals
	 - Globular Amphora: Super round and fat guy with tiny handles on the shoulders

[Conceptualizing the Bronze Age and two questions about Minoan palaces]
[Show you an artifacts related to an Aegean society and ask you to identify it]
### Origin of European Civilization
 - **Bronze Age**: Period between the dominance of small-scale farming communities and the rise of major state-level societies
	 - Bronze melts at a lower temperature than copper, easier to cast, produces a harder metal, very little found on sites
	 - Copper still used along with stone tools, bronze production more plentiful during following Iron Age
	 - Technology likely invented by Sumerians, diffused south to Egypt and Cycladic Greece (Cyprus)
 - **Minoans**: First state-level society in Europe, Crete is a larger island with better resources than other Cycladic islands
 - **Cretan Palaces**: Sir Arthur Evans excavated Minoan palace of Knossos, interpreted as kingly residence by Mycenaeans
 - **Early Minoan**: Three types of settlements dominated Crete: agricultural in hinterlands, trading on coast, marginal
	 - Massive sprawling palatial structures for hierarchical elites, only central courts occupied, large-scale communal rituals like feasting, key parts of commensality (eating together)
 - **Middle Minoan**: Palaces engaged in production, consumption, storage, distribution, no evidence for control of economy
	 - Residences of political/religious/economic authorities, ruled countryside, collected and stored agricultural surplus, produced elite material culture
		 - Textiles in Loom Weight Basement, Royal Pottery Stores w/ plain drinking ware, Vat Room w/ drinking vessels
	 - Economic centrality is speculative, consumes high-quality material culture rather than produces it
	 - Surrounding elite structures imitate palaces on smaller scale, palaces are decentered towns with nearby houses
	 - Should probably be called court-complexes, no evidence anyone lived in them full time
	 - 1700 BCE: First palaces all destroyed due to earthquakes, no evidence for military invasion
 - **Late Minoan**: Palaces quickly rebuilt after earthquakes, shut off from public use, became seats of elites, officials, servants
	 - Appear to control agricultural production through specialized irrigated farming (controlled the landscape)
	 - **Knossos**: Likely ruled Crete, women prominent on many frescoes (rulers?)
		 - Only surviving palace after island-wide destruction on Crete, destabilizing Minoan Crete (toward dictatorship)
	 - **Akrotiri on Thera (Santorini)**: Bronze Age Pompeii, most of the city was perfectly preserved. Some houses:
		 - Xeste 3: Rites of passage of young girls (frescoes); West House: Elite mansion of textiles, international trade
 - **Artifacts**:
	 - Depas Cup from Troy: Long thin cup with two handles
	 - Marble folded-arm sculptures from the Keros-Syros Culture: Folded armo guys
	 - Syros Frying Pan: Looks like a tennis racket without the handle
	 - Phaisos Disc: Disk covered in inscriptions to "decipher" Linear A

[this might be the bonus question, otherwise final lecture is useless]
### Core Tenants of Archaeological Interpretation
1. We cannot cherry pick evidence (choose to only present data that furthers our point, hide data that disproves it)
2. Evidence must be explainable through the logic of historical science (stratigraphy, context, typology, chronology)
3. Cannot make a claim based on negative or weak evidence, deflect the burden of proof to critics
4. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, unproven hypotheses can't form the foundation of new theories or understandings

# Readings
[Benati and Guerriero 2022: single True/False question related to their model for state formation, and specifically how elites convinced nonelites to participate.]
 - Key Tenet: Mix of adverse conditions and innovation pushed groups favoured by old technologies to establish the state
	 - Grants property rights to powerless individuals with new/complementary skills -> more inclusive political process
 - Not just dominated by elites relying only on violence, convince nonelites to participate in state formation by giving them stuff

[Daems 2020: I will ask you a question regarding what he calls â€˜social reactorsâ€™.]
 - Social Reactors: Face-to-face interactions (by population growth and concentration) stimulates innovation and social change
 - When a greater amount of people are closely concentrated, social learning and knowledge transfers are more efficient
	 - Feedback loop, more frequent interaction in highly clustered networks leading to more interaction
 - Emergent effects: Community formation, socio-economic growth, scalar stress
 - Induced by social groups reacting to variable situational events

[Furholt et al. 2020: I will ask you a question related to the case studies used in the article.]
 - Bottom up perspective on the construction of social power
 - Six elements essential to political economy to long-term social change:
	 - Aspiring power; Property rights; Collaboration and balancing; Resistance; Overlapping layers of action; Embeddedness
 - **Decentralized Networks in Coast Salish Political Development**: Stem from structural forms of resistance to centralized power and individual efforts to maintain the household and individual autonomy
	 - Elites provide access to social privilege and wealth unavailable to commoners
	 - Commoners exercised agency by choosing how and where to offer their labour resulting in tense social differentiation
 - **Neolithic Expansion into Europe, Voting With Your Feet**: Property rights fueled more social dependency & social stratification
	 - Early economic specialization and dependency noted in early Neolithic households.
	 - Favours those aspiring power who were balanced and resisted by other social collectives in decentralized society
 - **Migration as a Safety Valve: Voting With Your Paddles**: Maritime colonization was to escape growing structural inequalities
	 - Inequalities generated by success of agricultural economies in supporting population growth

[Kenoyer et al. 2013: I will ask you a question about the sample they used.]
 - Significant variation between Mesopotamia and Indus Valley, non-local individuals from either area should be very visible in the enamel strontium isotope rations
 - Substantial variation at the site of Harappa, multiple homelands for inhabitants of the city in the cemetery
 - Current sample of two human teeth from Ur is not sufficient

[Liu 2009: I will ask you a question about the case studies that she uses (pay attention to the site that she discusses).]
 - Taosi: Regional center in Linfen basin, identified 50 late Longshan sites forming 3 tier site hierarchy.
	 - Elite residences separated from commoners by walled enclosures, social hierarchy clear in mortuary practice
	 - Also craft production center. Major political, economic, ritual center in the region
	 - Elite may have held great ritual power from astronomical knowledge to determine the calendar
 - Wangchenggang: Characterized by multicentered competitive settlement system, settlement center for 22 unwalled sites
 - Liangzhu: Site cluster in Yuhang (particularly high density), 135 sites
	 - Central place is Mojiaoshan (ritual center), also sacrificial altars, burial sites, residential sites, jade/pottery workshops
	 - Known for large numbers of elaborate jade items, elite individuals may have been involved with manufacturing them
	 - State like social organization likely emerged here

[Pozorski and Pozorski 2018: ways in which the authors describe ChavÃ­n de HuÃ¡ntar and compare that to class.]
 - Original mindset that Chavin was the birthplace of Andean civilization, everything "early" was connected to it's influence
 - Burger established dated ceramic sequence for Chavin and its expansion, realized it was not the source of social complexity seen in dozens of coastal mound sites
	 - More likely the recipient of many coastal ideas
