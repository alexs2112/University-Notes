# Africa
### The Nile
 - The Nile Valley is a source of incredible ecological diversity through an arid and harsh desert environment
 - Problem: landscape dependent on rainfall far upstream
	 - Highlands with good winter rains: Nile would flood, bring nutrients to the plant life
	 - Highlands with poor winter rains: Only a meager flood, the valley would bake
	 - If the rains were too strong, the flood would wash everything away

### Stark Contrasts
 - Much uncertainty was eliminated by construction of the Aswan Dam in 1960s
 - Contrast between vegetation of the Nile Valley and the surrounding desert is striking
 - Landscape is an extreme case of circumscription: Limits of inhabitable land are very clearly defined
 - Often divided into two zones:
	 - Upper Egypt: Series of cataracts (rapids) around the modern border between Egypt and Sudan
	 - Lower Egypt: Regions north o the cataracts and inclusive of the Nile Delta, wide fertile land where the Nile spreads into several branches as it drains into the Mediterranean
 - Other major habitable areas in Egypt: Series of small oases in the Western Desert, Fayum Depression are the two best known

### Hunter Gatherers on the Nile
 - For 10ks of years, hunter-gatherer paradise. Rich habitat with game of all sizes, many wild edible plants, abundant fish and waterfowl
 - Flexible lifestyle was required to adjust to constant fluctuations in the flood levels
 - Sites: Little more than scatters of stone tools, bones, charcoal, lying on sandy dunes 3km from the Nile
	 - Key: Sites actually adjacent to a dried stream bed that would inundate with water during floods
 - This period, Upper Paleolithic to rise of Egyption state (3k BCE), the Predynastic Period

### Wadi Kubbaniya
 - Hunter gatherer camp situated NW of Aswan, dated to 17-15k BCE (Upper Paleolithic)
 - **Harvest**:
	 - Floodwaters would inundate the dunes for several weeks each summer, for the rest of the year people would live alongside the marshy floodplain
	 - When water began rising in July, catfish congregate in shallows to spawn
	 - Fish would be sluggish in shallow waters, caught with bare hands, hundreds caught over a few days
	 - Max flood: People continue to forage at the water edge, harvesting dates and acacia seeds
	 - Flood retreat: People catch trapped catfish, harvest nut grass and club-rush tubers. Single family could get enough carbs in a few hours to last many days
 - In fall and winter, inhabitants would turn to water lilies, wild millet, migratory ducks and geese
 - In spring, eat acacia seeds, dates, cattails
 - Life here: Not comfortable, annual flood varied so much that food resources were uncertain
	 - Needed to exploit as many resources as possible

### Qadan Culture
 - Broad-based hunter-gatherer economies continued for the rest of the Pleistocene, into the Holocene
 - Important trend: Move towards sedentary settlement, more intensive exploitation of fish and plants
 - South Egypt/North Sudan, identified thanks to microlithic stone tool industry associated with campsites along the Nile
 - The Qadan hunted big game in the late Pleistocene, grinding wild grains in early Holocene

### The Jebel Sahaba Cemetery, Sudan
 - Many individuals buried were killed by stone tools, or showed signs of violent lives
	 - Gender demographic was roughly 50/50
	 - 67% of burials showed signs of injury, half of heald fractures on hands
 - Dating to 13400 BP, earliest known evidence for human warfare
 - Reality: Groups had to settle around permanent water supplies, these hunter-gatherers battled other groups as natural resources dwindled/changed during the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene

### The Sahara in the Early Holocene
 - As the Pleistocene ended: Rainfall in northern Africa increased, enormous floods cut through the Nile floodplain and swept away the rich marshlands and fertile soils
 - Low areas in the Sahara became grasslands and shallow lakes, allowing hunter-gatherers to exploit that landscape more fully
	 - Movement between desert and the Nile valley increased
 - Life was more difficult after 6000 BCE, drought cycles grew longer and lakes shrank quickly

### Agricultural Origins on the Nile
 - Before modern archaeology, Childe assumed cereal crops and domesticated animals were introduced to the Nile Valley from SW Asia
 - New evidence: Argued food production emerged independently in Egypt, the Sudan, the Sahara, all during the Neolithic
	 - Evidence was fragmentary and controversial
 - Opinions today: maybe agriculture was actually introduced from outside as Childe suggested

### Early Agricultural Environment
 - 6000 BCE: Severe drought hit much of SW Asia, decimating game and causing crop failures in Israel and Syria
	 - Response: Farmers moved from dryer zones into forested Mediterranean near the coast
 - Nile Valley also in drought, territories shrank, people started turning to domesticates as a safety net during unpredictable climates
 - No change on daily life, this farming was a very small scale form of insurance

### Archaeological Evidence
 - Agricultural methods were likely the simplest imaginable
 - In a few centuries, practice produced domesticated versions of wheat that had become staples in the local diet. New strains needed constant attention (weeding, watering), each village became dependent on crops
 - Archaeological evidence for this is nearly nonexistent
	 - Domesticated barley from Nabta Playa dating to 6000 BCE
	 - Larger settlements, houses represented by low pits sunk in the ground
 - These are the first Neolithic group to live in Egypt

### Fayum Debate
 - Small Fayum depression, 6000 BCE: Small fishing camps along waters edge.
	 - Unlike people around the Nabta Basin, people at Fayum did not use cereals
 - Around 5200 BCE: People settled in seasonal camps on the lakeshore, moving with lake level
 - Cultivated wheat and barley, moved plots with the changing water levels
 - Also herded goats, pigs, cattle, most food came from fish
 - Difference from Nabta Playa: Fayum farmers didn't build permanent villages as their environment was too unpredictable to rely on agriculture entirely
 - Current thinking: This seasonally filled depression only supported part-time farmers

### Earliest Farmers in the Nile Valley
 - Earliest evidence dates between 5000-3300 BCE
	 - Valley not used exclusively for farming in this town, nomadic desert groups likely moved in and out of this valley regularly
 - This movement became significant after 2500 BCE, conditions became extremely arid and floods at their lowest
 - People had to get very close to the water to exploit cultivated plants
	 - When flood levels returned, all these early farming sites were buried
 - The point: Movements of farmers, irregular movements of nomadic groups in and out of the Nile Valley resulted in very high cultural diversity

### The Merimde Culture
 - Many of the lost early agricultural villages were likely like Merimde Beni Salama near the Nile Delta (5200-4000 BCE)
 - Cluster of semi-subterranean oval houses, found with superstructures of mud and sticks
	 - 2m occupation mounds discovered here, occupied for 600 years
	 - Buried their dead within the settlement in the flexed position without grave goods
 - Phase 1 of the site (5000-4500) had no evidence for grain or farming tools
 - Phase 2 of the site (4500-4000) has evidence for charred seeds, serrated flint sickle inserts
 - Merimde clay head dates to the end of the Merimde cultural sequence, one of the earliest known representations of a human head in Egypt

### The Badarian Culture
 - Contemporary early agricultural society, further south in the Upper Nile, 5000-4000 BCE
 - What we know about them:
	 - Bows and arrows with flaked arrowheads, unique hollow base
	 - Cultivated emmer wheat and barley, cattle as most of their meat
	 - Settlements made of mudbrick, some wooden supports, evidence is ephemeral
	 - Ceramics were distinctive red and black, black-topped pottery
	 - People buried in linen shrouds, covered in animal skins, most burials were women usually with ivory combs
	 - Female mortuary figurines, carved from ivory, known sporadically. Possible origin for later Egyption beliefs in the afterlife

### Dawn of Complexity in the Nile Valley
 - 3500 BCE, inhabitants living almost entirely off agriculture, very minimal hunting
	 - Population densities were low, not enough social capital to form states
 - No large-scale irrigation in the valley at this time, modern Nile Valley looks nothing like its predynastic condition
	 - Farmers followed the movements of the water, planting in shallow basins and swamps
	 - Small villages flourished on the high ground near the riverbanks
	 - When the water rose again, harvest was over, herds grazed on the dry margins of the river
 - Egyption farmers in 3500 BCE had no use for irrigation technology, could watch natural patterns and exploit the variable environment
	 - Irrigation technology emerges 3000 BCE, so too does centralized government and "the state"

### Taming Saharan Herds
 - Seems like one of the most desolate places on earth
 - Diverse (but dry) ecosystem with many changes since 10k BCE
 - Result: Wild oxen in landscape moved in smaller herds, disciplined about finding food and water
	 - Easier for humans to move among them, predict their habits, modify the herd population by culling
 - Hunters knew their prey very well, prevented them from moving instead of waiting for migrating
	 - Culling animals resulted in biological changes: Easier to control, needed to maintain offspring numbers by regularly introducing new bulls into the herd

### First Saharan Pastoralists
 - Herders began selecting for different cattle traits, like horn shapes and hide colours, according to depictions of cattle in Saharan rock art
 - Archaeological evidence suggests cattle were domesticated by 7000 BCE in the eastern Sahara by hunter-gatherers
	 - Taming them brought stability to their food supply
	 - Ritual significance before they were tamed, bull horns found in burials from 10k BCE
 - Herders had few possessions, known best through their cave paintings, some from 5k BCE
 - By 3500, conditions deteriorated again, herders moved south, likely using domesticated crops now

### Early Food Production in Sub-Saharan Africa
 - After Pleistocene, inhabitants of SubSaharan Africa probably adopted early form of vegeculture on fringes of rainforest
 - African yams easily resprout if the top is replanted
	 - May have been tradition leading to adoption of cereal cultivation
 - As the Sahara was drying up after 6000 BCE, pastoral people moved south in the savannah belt
	 - By 3000 BCE, Egyption state civilization was emerging
	 - Pastoral people lived in East African highlands further south, ideal cattle country, home of Masai today
 - Cattle are demanding animals:
	 - Require water every 24 hours
	 - Large enough grazing lands for large herds
 - Secret: Choose the right grazing land
 - Much of central Africa home to the tsetse fly and its disease: trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness)
	 - This disease limited long term human settlement, herders had to keep moving south

### Pure Pastoralists?
 - No society subsists on herds alone
	 - Saharan herders who moved south to escape drought were cultivating sorghum and millet
	 - 1500 BCE: Agriculture was widespread in the savanna belt
 - Small farming communities existed at the forest edge, practiced shifting/slash-and-burn agriculture
 - This was necessary: African soils outside floodplains have low fertility
	 - Also wooden and stone tools were of limited use to dig in clay rich savannah soils
	 - Farming would remain small scale domestic endeavour here until iron arrives in 700 BCE, after this: slash-and-burn expands across all of South Africa in only 200 years
