# History and Theory
### Tell es-Sultan (Jericho), West Bank
 - Associated with biblical story of Jericho: Joshua led the Israelites to defeat the Caananites here
 - Bible: Joshua and Israelites walked around city forr 6 days with horns and Ark of Covenant
	 - On 7th day, walls of Jericho fell and they slaughtered every man, woman, child, animal due to god
 - No evidence for any settlement dating to the biblical period (middle to late Bronze Age, 1500-1200 BCE)
 - Instead the deepest deposits were an early Neolithic community from 10000 BCE
 - Towards end of excavations in 1953, discovered several human skulls plastered with clay, seashells embedded in eye sockets
	 - Situated in domesti areas, display by occupants
	 - Seven skull sfound in this context
 - Early interpretation: Skulls were revered ancestors, intermediaries between living and spiritual world
 - Maybe symbols of new spiritual order

### Reconnecting With The Natural World
 - Development of agriculture: Profound reorientation in how humans related to plants and animals
 - Still had a sense of balance during a period of significant social change
 - Almost our entire evolutionary history (99%) we've been hunting, fishing, and gathering
	 - Only in last 15k years, human groups have shifted towards agriculture, production of resources through crops and livestock
 - Transition one of the most profound and significant events in prehistory. Three broad forms:
	 - Domestication of plants and animals
	 - Technology (new tools for harvesting and processing food, storage like pottery)
	 - Sedentism (communities of villages and constructed landscapes)
 - Almost every aspect of human society changes during this period.

### Origins of Agriculture
 - Was it a quick and serious switch (an Agricultural Revolution) or was it a long and slow process?
 - Many think of origins of agriculture in terms of myths. Lived in a biblical Garden of Eden before choosing agriculture
	 - Creates concept of private property, falling from the garden, terrible state ever since
	 - Rousseau (1755): "All ran towards their chains, believing they were securing their liberty; for although they had reason enough to discern the advantages of a civil order, they did not have experience enough to foresee the dangers"
	 - Marshall Sahlins (1968): Hunter gatherer lifeways were easy and peasful. Original affluent society with more time for leisure than any human group since. Losing freedom
	 - Jared Diamond (1987): Agriculture is the worst mistake in the history of the human race. Made us dependent on its products
	 - Yuval Harari (2014): Wheat domesticated humans, tricked us into spreading it all over the world by becoming agriculturalists, enslaved to it
 - Reject myths, look to origins of agriculture in terms of the evidence

### Other Perspectives
 - Lewis Henry Mogran, Ancient Society (1877)
	 - Invention of agriculture allowed us to exist outside the world of nature, move toward supremacy over the planet
	 - Scale: Invention of agriculture shifted society from "savagery" to "barbarism"
	 - "Barbaric" society: Invention of pottery, domestication, construction out of mud brick
	 - Important stage in the process of humanity
 - V. Gordon Childe, Man Makes Himself (1936)
	 - Marxism and October Revolution of 1917, took Morgan's ideas about agriculture, suggested change was so profound it must have been a Neolithic Revolution
	 - Theory: Massive drought in SW Asia prompted hunter gatherer groups to settle and find more reliable ways to get food
	 - Agriculture allowed humans a greater control of food supply, enhance population growth. Eventually leads to social complexity with administration to deal with surplus and people
 - Robert Braidwood (1940s):
	 - Investigated sites, found no evidence of climate catastrophes (Childe's theory was wrong)
	 - Developing agriculture was a shift in the relationship between humans and nature. Removed ourselves from nature by inventing agriculture
 - David Rindos (1984):
	 - "The idea that we as a culture, a nation, or a species are in conscious control of our environment and thus of our destiny is one part truth, one part rhetoric, and two parts wishful thinking"
 - Multiple places developed agriculture independent of each other at different times
 - Since 1960s, multivariate models to help explain why people moved from hunting + gathering to producing food. Most involve an external (climatic) trigger
 - We have learned over the last 70 years that hunter gatherer societies were more complex, more preadapted to food production than prehistorians ever realized

### Population Pressure
 - We know agriculture appears in eastern Asia earlier than Mesoamerica and the Andes
 - Theory: Population pressure led hunter gatherers to switch to farming because they reached the limit of what their food resources could support
	 - Need to make food more predictable
 - No archaeological evidence for growing populations during the periods when farming was taking hold in Asia and Mesoamerica

### Co-Evolutionary Theories
 - Dave Rindos, *The Origins of Agriculture: An Evolutionary Perspective* (1984)
 - Tim Ingold, *The Perception of the Environment* (2000)
	 - Argues against the removal of humans from nature
	 - Modern hunter-gatherers don't see a distinction between natural and human
 - The real change: Humans moved from having relationships based on trust to a world where theyre based on domination
	 - Hunter-gatherer relationships with environment and others is based on trust
	 - Agriculturalists must dominate crops and livestock, force it to be predictable
 - Result: Crops and livestock are dependent on us, we're dependent on them
	 - Controlling agriculture becomes a life or death situation that develops through coevolutionary principles

### Social Theories
 - Was the adoption of agriculture a social development?
	 - Creation of surplus, eventually sedentism
 - Another angle: Maybe agriculture was the result of social competition, social prestige via feasts
 - Harder models to test since the variables are many, data is fragmented
	 - Some examples suggest social theories are plausible
 - Ultimately theories are complicated and only work in small regions. Sometimes took groups thousands of years to settle into agriculture
 - Key: Human decision making in the face of selective pressures

### Environmental Theories
 - Climate change was never a prime mover of social developments, undeniable that short-term shifts could force people to make new decisions about food procurement
 - Some ecological models suggest that when hunter gatherers identified these new ways of getting food, they began to expand their search to other attractive resource bases, maybe some stuck?
 - Kent Flannery: How Mesoamericans came to farm maize. Tried different plants and animals based on migration and growing seasons. Eventually became too invested in maize and focused on it
 - Problem:
	 - What processes caused people to deliberately shift to cultivation?

### Big Questions
 - Why did agriculture take hold so late in human history?
	 - Once successful, spread rapidly as increasing populations prevented reverting to hunting + gathering
	 - Periods in Pleistocene when agriculture could have been attempted. Did not, likely due to population. Cyclical changes in climate prevented small groups of people from growing exponentially or staying in one ecosystem for too long
	 - At end of Pleistocene, populations grew to a level that limited population mobility. Needed to find new ways to avoid food shortages
 - Why is there so much difference in when agriculture was adopted around the world
	 - Eg: Farming in East Asia by 10k BCE, Mesoamerica by 5k BCE, tropical Africa by 1k BCE
	 - Populations in Asia and Mesoamerica started manipulating potential domesticates (grasses and roots) immediately after the Pleistocene
	 - Populations in humid tropical regions had lots of game and wild plant foods, did not need to farm them
 - Can rule out "progress" as an explanation for the adoption of agriculture

### Variables
 - Looking for sets of conditions where population pressure, distribution of plants, rate at which the environment was changing, and techniques of harvesting, all made agriculture viable
 - Must account for variations among potentially domesticable plants and animals (some resisted domestication)
 - Must understand seasonal distributions of wild vegetable foods or game, may have prevented experiments in domestication during certain times of the year, forcing people to rely on hunting and gathering
 - **Critical Variable**: Same human intellect that resulted in our mass colonization of the world
