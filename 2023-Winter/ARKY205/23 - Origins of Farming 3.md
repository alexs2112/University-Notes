# Asia and the Pacific
### Origins of Asian Plant Cultivation
 - Rice: Staple of ancient agriculture over much of south and southeast Asia
 - For a long time, we knew almost nothing about how it was first domesticated
	 - Learned from sites like Hemudu, Tianluoshan in the Yangtze region, waterlogged and excellently preserved
 - Another plant cultivated around the same time: Millet

### Introducing Rice and Millet
 - Rice was earliest plant domesticated in the Yangtze Valley, millet was domesticated in colder Yellow River north
	 - Rice: Marsh grass, flourishes in warm conditions as last Ice Age ended
 - Initial propagation of these wilde ancestors: Alluvial swamp area in the middle Yangtze Valley at the northern limits for rice cultivation
	 - Seasonal flooding would disperse the seeds throughout the wetlands
	 - Wetland habitats: Perfect for water chestnuts, camellia roots, lots of fish, attracted deer and pigs
 - Rice was minor in diets because mature seeds easily shatter and are hard to harvest
	 - Over time, humans selected for non-shattering plants, creating domestic variety of today

### Domesticating Rice
 - History of rice domestication covers many millenia
 - Traced by botanists through an abscission layer on the seed
	 - Process first seen at sites in lower Yangtze region (famous at Hemudu)
	 - These sites show first efforts to cultivate rice from expanding seasonally inundated habitats by building dams to trap runoff water, releasing to create newly flooded land in other places (paddies)
 - Sedentary life began in the Holocene in these low-lying seasonally flooded environments, cultivation as response to population growth

### Early Farming in China
 - Farming spreading from SW Asia into Europe, two agricultural systems developed on Yellow and Yangtze rivers
 - Rice gathered between 10k and 6k BCE as documented at Yuchan Cave in Hunan province
	 - May also have earliest evidence for ceramic vessels in the world (16k BCE)
 - Took around 4k years of food production to be established in different regions
	 - Chinese river systems made spread of farming a bit easier

### Southern and Eastern China
 - Archaeology shows that southern China is likely where rice cultivation first began
	 - Warm early Holocene allowed rice to colonize marshlands and lakes in middle and lower Yangtze Valley
 - Diaotonghuan Cave site shows wild rice exploitation by 10k BCE, between 8-7k BCE they were growing it
	 - Right after return of humid conditions after the cold Younger Dryas
	 - When the cold reemerged, wild rice retreated to warmer environments
		 - Maybe they had no choice but to cultivate the rice as it was disappearing
 - Larger permanent settlements soon emerged
	 - Pengtoushan site (6500-5800 BCE) has definitive evidence for rice farming

### Early Farming Cultures in Southern China
 - Rice farming was flourishing after 7000 BCE, one of the best known early cultures: Hemudu, south of Shanghai
	 - Hemudu site was once surrounded by forests and ponds, much ecological diversity, occupied 5.5-3.3k BCE
	 - Incredible mortise-and-tenon wooden construction, bone hoes, cord decorated coarse black ceramics
 - Another later culture offshore on Taiwan: Tapenkeng
	 - Fishing, hunting, foraging around 5k BCE
	 - Same black cord-decorated pottery, no evidence
	 - Many archaeologists think the cord-decorated pottery cultures from this period all had common cultural traits, despite lack of evidence agriculture was part of its dispersal

### Path to Complexity in Southern China
 - Lower Yangtze, rice was still only part of broad-spectrum hunting and gathering around 6k BCE
	 - Around 1k years later, Tianluoshan, rice was clearly very important
 - By 3000 BCE, more sophisticated agricultural societies flourished on the Yangtze and beyond
	 - Graves give us the best information for this
	 - Later graves show social differentiation in quantity, quality of ornaments, pottery, tools
 - What we see: Concentration of wealth, trends towards ranked societies with shift toward greater importance placed on men over women
	 - Not sure, maybe men were becoming more valued for their roles in food production
 - Only with Liangzhu culture (3200-2300 BCE) does rice play a dominant role in local economies
	 - Populations grew significantly after this

### Agricultural Environment in Northern China
 - Second center of early Chinese agriculture occurred where the Yellow River flows out of the mountains into low plains of Northern China
	 - Instead of rice, millet was cultivated here (8400 BCE, rice arrived later around 6500-5500 BCE)
 - During Pleistocene glaciations, loess sediment formed over the north
	 - Loess: Fine, soft-textured aeolian deposit, nutritious and easily tilled with digging sticks
	 - Concentrated summer rainfall meant agriculture took hold easily here
 - Lots of available plants for domestication
 - Villages formed along foothills or plains next to small streams or low river terraces

### Early Neolithic Cultures in Northern China
 - One of the few known sedimentary sites in the north: Nanzhuangtou in the Hubei province
	 - Flourished in warm and wet climate around 12k BCE, no seeds were found here
	 - Wild plant foods were still very important, especially foxtail millet
 - Cishan Village, western edge of North China Plain, cultivated millet around 8400-5500 BCE
	 - Some of the best documented agricultural communities from Northern China are in the central Yellow River valley in small basin surrounded by highlands and swamps

### First Farmers of Northern China
 - 2 Scenarios for emergence of agriculture:
	 - People on Yellow River passed a long phase of experimental+intensive cultivation of plants before developing distinctive agricultural techniques
	 - Agriculture developed in the south and knowledge about it moved north
 - This part of China also has distinctive cord-decorated pottery, perhaps the tradition linked with the south
 - Earliest agricultural society with evidence: Loosely defined Peiligang culture (6300-5100 BCE)
	 - Settlements consisted of semisubterranean houses, large storage pits for millet
	 - Kept dogs and pigs, cultivated huge amounts of millet they stored rather than collecting wild varieties

### Best Known Early Farmers: Yangshao
 - Flourished over much of the Yellow River basin from 5000 to 3000 BCE
	 - Culture covered an area similar to farming centers in Egypt or Mesopotamia
 - Each village was self-contained, usually built on river terrace overlooking the valley and avoiding flood risk
	 - Used digging sticks and hoes to cultivate millet in riverside gardens, flooded every spring
	 - Hunting, foraging, fishing were still important
 - By 3200 BCE, very developed culture with naturalistic art style, expert potters with vessels to steam food
 - Some think roots of modern Chinese cuisine and language originate with the Yangshao

### Spread of Early Farming in North China
 - The Yangshao culture expanded outward along river valleys, eventually (3000 BCE) new regional variations emerge
 - Spread took agricultural practices all around northern China
	 - Led to increasing populations and concentrations of wealth in the hands of the few
 - More famous: Longshan culture developed earthen walled settlements around 3000 BCE
	 - Major difference: based partly on irrigation and rice cultivation
	 - Reduced dependence on dry agriculture associated with millet
	 - Used pottery wheels to create sophisticated thin walled black ceramics
 - This richer, more elaborate farming cultures were the foundations of Chinese civilization

### Holocene Japan
 - 10000 BCE, sea levels around Japan were rising, shrinking territory of hunter-gatherers considerably
 - Like Mesolithic of Europe: Asian groups were settled along coasts and lakeshores, exploited a wide range of maritime food resources
	 - Sedentism appeared near concentrations of resources, well-defined cultural territories
 - One early group from Japan: The Jomon people
	 - 12.5k BCE: making ceramic pots, first for food preparation (steaming mollusks, boiling vegetables), allowing people to exploit food resources more fully
	 - Over time: Jomon pots became more elaborate, functions now include serving and storing food
	 - Culture best known for elaborate and early ceramic industry
 - Other post-glacial development: Jomon people eventually adopted logical practice of deliberately growing crops and taming animals

### The Jomon Culture
 - Thousands of Jomon sites known on Japan, most from Honshu in central Japan
	 - Look like theyre linked by cultural traditions, likely different ethnic and speaking groups
 - Hunted deer, collected shellfish, fished
	 - Diet also depended heavily on wild plants
 - Increasingly sedentary in caves and pit houses
 - Evidence for agriculture in early period is sketchy, probably practiced elaborate processing and storage of nuts along with small-scale cultivation of millet varieties
 - Jomon tradition lasted for almost 10k years, up to 300 BCE. By 5000 BCE they reached high sophistication with ritual pots and lived in wooden houses
	 - After 3000 BCE, colder climate strained island carrying capacity, populations declined
	 - Rice cultivation didnt begin until after 1000 BCE

### Unique Spread of Farming in SE Asia
 - Unlike mainland Asia and Japan: Farming was important to the colonization of the Pacific islands
	 - 15 kya, hunter-gatheres lived in SE Asia with very similar stone tools
	 - Sunda shelf not yet submerged, Borneo, Sumatra, Java were still connected to Thailand, Singapore, Cambodia, Vietnam
 - As sea levels rose around 4000 BCE, coastal communities flourished here, making pottery & consuming rich maritime resources
	 - Also exploiting a range of potential domesticates, including rice and yams
 - Exploiting these resources since the Pleistocene (yams is easy to plant), not sure what factors led to deliberate experimentation with various plants
 - Archaeological evidence is limited. We speculate early shifting agriculture, combined crops and animal herding, had its roots in broad-spectrum hunting and gathering (like everywhere else)
 - Sediment cores around and in Lake Kumphawapi in NE Thailand provides a clue:
	 - 4500 BCE: cores suggest huge decline in forest cover coinciding with an increase in charcoal
	 - Was this due to people?
 - What about rice? Spread into SE Asia or developed indigenously is a mystery

### Khok Phanom Di Site, Thailand
 - Large and wealthy rice farming community at the Khok Phanom Di mound, occupied 2000-1400 BCE
	 - Has evidence for rice husks despite poor soil for cultivation, maybe imported
 - Most famous aspect: Excavated burial known as The Princess of Khok Phanom Di
	 - Grave with numerous pots balanced on pyramid of clay cylinders, placed over female skeleton covered in red ochre
	 - The interred died around age 30, covered in over 121k shell ornaments and a pottery anvil
	 - Likely a potter in life who grew very wealthy trading amongst the travelers passing through the Bang Pakong River estuary. Excavator interpretation: likely an early ruler, roots of later Queendoms in Thailand, Cambodia

### Agriculture on the Islands
 - Constantly changing SE Asian coastlines likely inspired inhabitants to experiment with plants and domestic animals to find some insurance during environmental unpredictability
 - Offshore: Totally different Neolithic world. Rice cultivation occurred in the Philippines in 2000 BCE, root crops like taro instead became staples
 - First settlements: Fairly homogenous groups by coasts and rivers, canoes playing a major role in intervillage exchange in pots, adzes, axes
	 - Similar forms over wide areas suggest a single general economy
	 - Obsidian from New Britain found over hundreds of kms away

### Development of Agriculture on New Guinea
 - Assumed that agriculture first developed in the lowlands of New Guinea, then spread into the uplands
 - New radiocarbon dates of cultivated banana, taro, yam show it was actually well established in the upper Wahgi Valley near Kuk by 4900 BCE
 - Strong argument is made that agriculture developed here independently
	 - 4000-3500 BCE: More organized horticulture works in Kuk basin, much forest clearance
	 - After 2000 BCE: Highly advanced drainage systems, more intensive farming
 - Still don't know how these plants arrived, these people created artificial garden environment after long period of experimenting with native plants
	 - Probably led to sedentism, need to further intensify food production

### Archaeology of Pacific Island Farming
 - Colonisation of the Pacific Islands wouldnt have been possible without the technology to cultivate root ccrops like taro and yams along with breadfruit, coconuts, and sugarcane
	 - Chickens, dogs, pigs also a part of these colonizations
 - Reality: These islands had little natural food, bringing these items were necessary for survival
	 - Items small enough to bring on canoes allow large populations to spread over hundreds of small islands
 - Beyond the Solomon Islands, new lands were particularly impoverished, early cultivation of yams and taro was essential
