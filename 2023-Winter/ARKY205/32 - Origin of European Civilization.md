# The Minoans
### Earliest European State?
 - Neolithic Europe developed many aspects of state societies, but elites did not have legitimacy over violence/control over information (likely charismatic leaders)
 - First European state has its foundation around 2000 BCE, looks like a state by 1600 BCE during the Bronze Age
 - Aegean Sea, specifically the island of Crete
	 - Minoans: Sir Arthur Evans named after Minotaur and King Minos of Crete

### Bronze Age
 - Convenient name for a crucial period between the dominance of small-scale farming societies and the rise of major state level societies
 - Bronze: Alloy of copper with lead, arsenic, tin (much less toxic)
	 - Melts at a lower temperature than copper, easier to cast, produces a harder metal
 - Very little bronze is found on sites in this period, use varied over time and place
 - Copper metallurgy still used along with stone tools
 - Bronze production more plentiful during the following Iron Age
 - Smelting technology likely invented by the Sumerians around 3800 BCE, diffused south to Egypt through the Levant
	 - Knowledge reached Cycladic Greece through Cyprus around 3300 BCE

### Cycladic Civilization
 - One of the more complex societies in the Aegean is known as Cycladic culture (sometimes civilization)
 - 3400-3000 BCE: at least one small farming community on each island developed into a complex settlement
	 - Evidence for wide-scale shipping, social inequality, complex shared material culture
 - 3000-2000 BCE: island societies continued to develop, build on interregional connections with Greek mainland (west), Anatolia and Eastern Mediterranean (east) and large island of Crete (south)
 - Defensive societies, likely required centralized ruler/council to manage affairs
	 - Very limited resources, maintaining neighbourly relations were important
	 - No evidence for direct control over violence or information

### The Minoans
 - First state level society in Europe
	 - Disagreement about when they should be called a state, agree they were the first
 - Crete is a larger island, potential for larger groups to live communally, share in development of social complexity
	 - Also better agricultural resources compared to the small rocky Cycladic islands
 - Common interpretation around 2000 BCE: Kings controlled the countryside from palaces as paramount rulers
	 - Legitimacy of violence, control over information, charismatic rule
 - Bull iconography is popular in Minoan Crete, may be linked to rite of passage of leaping over bulls

### Cretan Palaces: Legacy of Knossos
 - Sir Arthur Evans excavated Minoan palace site of Knossos from 1900-1904
 - Interpretation: Buildings were kingly residences based on mythology and architecture
	 - Reality is more complicated
 - Based interpretations on the later Mycenaean-dominated Crete, applied these to this earlier ambiguous material
	 - Now we view the origins of these palaces differently

### Early Minoan (EM, 3100-2000 BCE)
**Settlement and Urbanism**:
 - End of Neolithic, three types of settlements dominated Crete
	 - Agricultural sites in productive hinterlands
	 - Trading sites on the coast
	 - Marginal sites
 - 2700 BCE (EM I): Most marginal sites abandoned, agricultural sites growing in size, settlements began to look like early cities (proto-urbanism)
 - Growth of proto-urban sites continued into 2200 BCE (EM II)
	 - Supported by more complex social hierarchies, privileged access to prestige goods
 - Coastal sites (Malia, Palaikastro) benefitted from this situation, inland sites (Knossos, Phastos) did not
**Palaces**:
 - Palaces Evans excavated were massive sprawling structures for hierarchical elites
	 - In EM period, only the central courts were occupied
 - Courts: Evidence for large-scale communal ritual like feasting
	 - Monumental spaces with ramped entrances, restrict/control access
 - Key part of communal rites were commensality (eating + drinking together)
	 - EM I pottery: Large vessels, household groups ate and drank from the same bowls
	 - EM IIA: Vessel forms shrank, become widespread, hierarchical differences between ceramic, stone, metal
 - Social hierarchies developing, look more like Cahokia, less like Dynastic Ur and Uruk

### Middle Minoan (MM)
**Palaces**:
 - Evans tried to link this period to dynastic Minoan kings like Minos
 - Colin Renfrew (1972): Palaces were residences of political, religious, economic authority
	 - Ruled countryside, collected and stored agricultural surplus, produced elite material culture
 - Evidence:
	 - Textile production in  in the Loom Weight Basement
	 - Agricultural commodity transactions according to hierglyphs on clay seals of grain, figs, olives
	 - MM IIA Royal Pottery Stores: stacks of plain drinking ware, fine pottery imported from countryside
	 - MM IB Vat Room: Plaster-lined pit with drinking vessels, obsidian debitage, high-value items
 - Economic centrality of these structures is speculative, appear to consume high-quality material culture rather than produce it
 - Smaller elite structures in the surrounding landscape were doing the same thing as palaces on a smaller scale
	 - Palaces appear to be decentered towns with nearby affluent houses conducting affairs the same way
 - New evidence: Palaces should probably be called court-complexes during the MM period
	 - No evidence anyone lived in them full time
	 - Ritual centers for large-scale communal feasting, storage facilities for feasts, not out of economic control
**Writing**:
 - Cretan hieroglyphs used during MM IA, IB
	 - Presumed ideographic script (symbol = concept), remain undeciphered
	 - Inscriptions from four main sites: Knossos, Malia, Petras, Phaistos
	 - Phastos Disc is a contentious example (forgery), several claims of decipherment, no consensus
 - More famous is Linear A, presumed syllabic script (MM II to LM periods)
	 - Cut with a stylus rather than stamped like cuneiform
	 - Also remains undeciphered
	 - Inscriptions from dozens of sites on Crete, few sites on the Aegean islands and the southern mainland
**State?**:
 - Still look more like Cahokia or Pueblo Bonito than the state societies of Sumer and Egypt
 - Palaces engaged in production, consumption, storage, distribution
	 - No evidence they controlled the economies or politics of their territories
 - Written script being developed, perhaps to handle a growing administration
 - 1700 BCE: These first palaces were all destroyed, likely due to earthquakes, no evidence for military invasion
	 - Almost every major site is rebuilt by 1650 BCE, start of the Late Minoan (LM) phase

### Late Minoan (LM)
 - LM IA: Palaces quickly rebuilt after the earthquakes of MM II-III, shut off from public use
	 - Become the seats of elites, officials, servants
	 - Dynastic palace model of Evans, by LM IB subphase the process is complete
 - Survey in the Kavousi district of Crete:
	 - Sites relovated early in the LM period from mixed-crop locations into the lowlands, near coast and roads
	 - Settlement nucleation
 - 1600-1500 BCE: Palaces appear to control agricultural production through specialized irrigated farming
	 - Palaces exerting control over the landscape
**Knossos**:
 - Prior to Mycenaean domination, not clear that Knossos was the seat of a king/queen
	 - Rebuilt after the collapse of the First Palaces (1700 BCE), maybe still a ceremonial center
 - Women prominant on many Minoan frescoes dating from the LM I period
	 - Likely ruling Crete for 200 years between collapse of palaces, later domination by Mycenae
**Atlantis Destroyed**:
 - Island-wide destruction on Crete at end of LM IB (1500 BCE), all Second/New Palaces destroyed minus Knossos
 - Unlikely related to the well-known Theran eruption
	 - Likely destabilized Minoan Crete with factional politics towards dictatorship, didn't destroy it
	 - Factional political situation allowed Mycenaeans to exert their dominance over Crete in LM II
**Akrotiri on Thera (Santorini)**:
 - LBA Cycladic settlement on Thera, buried by 1628 BCE eruption, often called the **Bronze Age Pompeii**
	 - Much of the prehistoric city was perfectly preserved
 - Typical Cycladic settlement, heavily Minoanized with pottery and architectural styles
 - Several houses fully excavated
	 - Xeste 3 used in rites of passage for young girls based on surviving frescos
	 - West House was an elite mansion, produced textiles, likely had international trade contacts
**LM II-III: Post Palatial Crete**:
 - After 1500 BCE: Knossos continued ruling Crete, almost certainly under Mycenaean control (not Minoan elites)
	 - Small Minoan statelets arose from LM IB destructions, may have been semi-autonomous from Knossos
 - LM III (1400-1300 BCE): Palace at Knossos destroyed for the final time (maybe revolution)
 - Following loss of Knossos, mainland Mycenaeans expanded through the Aegean with alarming speed, efficiency
	 - Soldiers at the forefront of this expansion

### The Mycenaeans
 - Centers on the Greek mainland, grows to control most of the Aegean including the Cycladic islands, Crete
 - Surely represent a state:
	 - Linear A was replaced by Linear B
	 - Royal correspondence sent between rulers and pharaohs of Egypt, Hittites of Anatolia
	 - Citadels were essentially urban
	 - Ruled using direct force with a powerful army controlled by a king or wanax
	 - Royal tombs show spectacular levels of wealth, unlike Minoans their palaces had throne rooms
 - Point: Minoans laid the groundwork for the wealth of Mycenaeans by making, keeping trade relations with Eastern Mediterranean
	 - Mycenae conquered Knossos to gain total control over the political and economic spheres of the Aegean

### Were the LM Minoans a State?
 - Evidence is ambiguous, most scholars say yes
	 - Central ruler (likely women) or ruling council
	 - Controlled trade in the southern Aegean, much wealth funneled from the East (Hittites, Egypt) into Greece
	 - Advanced writing system in Linear A
	 - Controlled and stored agricultural surplus from the countryside, at least after 1600 BCE
		 - Don't know how they coerced rural populace into paying
 - Maybe peaceful Minoans were able to build a state, not on threat of violence, but on ideals of trade and international relations
	 - No aspect reflects male kings, women are prominent (priestesses and rulers?)
 - Minoans: Foundation of statehood that would eventually lead to Classical Greeks, Romans, eventually Western Europe
