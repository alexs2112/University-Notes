### Late Mesolithic Climate
 - Rainfall and temperature increased
 - Beginning of the Holocene Climatic Optimum, Europe was hotter and wetter than today
 - 8000 BP, dense forests of oak and other deciduous trees spread over most of central Europe
	 - Northern Europe: Coniferous forests
	 - Souther Europe: Open forests and parklands
 - Sea levels continue to rise, Britain officially becomes an island
 - Dense vegetation, restricting travel and hunting visibility while limiting habitation areas
	 - New plant foods became available, animal movements more predictable

### Late Mesolithic Microliths
 - New trapezoidal form of microlith: Trapezes
	 - Triangular versions of the microburin technique practically disappear
 - More refined blade technique, produced larger and more regular forms
	 - Earliest: Franchthi Cave, Greece, spread rapidly into Sweden and France, didn't reach Britain
 - Dominated assemblages, replaced inset microliths as arrowheads
	 - Did more damage by cutting animal body tissue than simply penetrating
	 - Advantage in dense forests of Atlantic Period, might only have one good shot with less range and less force

### Late Mesolithic Tools
 - Microliths decline in number (fewer needed on arrows?)
 - Flakes axe heads become more common
 - Perforated "Mace Heads": weights for digging sticks used to find roots -> greater dietary importance
 - Hammerstones found in abundance, probably for breaking bones or nuts

### Ground, Pecked, Polished
 - Remarkable diversification in stone tool technology
	 - Instead of totally flaked assemblages, polished artifacts appear
 - Stronger than flakes versions, edges can be straightened to avoid constant breakage
	 - People circulated good stone for making strong axes and adzes

### Late Mesolithic Innovations
 - Vis, Russia: Remains of skis and sleds found in a bog, facilitated winter travel
 - Fishing intensified: Evidence for complex wooden traps and weirs, fishing prongs, ground bone spear heads, nets, baskets
 - Hollad & Denmark: Dugout canoes in much greater quantities
	 - Tybrind Vig, Denmark: Hearth built inside to facilitate night fishing, had a ballast stone

### First European Ceramic Vessels
 - Very end of the Mesolithic, first good evidence for ceramic vessels in Europe
	 - Sherds from Ertebolle sites in southern Sweden, 5600 BP
	 - Pointed bases, allowing them to be placed in sand or bottom of boat
 - Pots from native clays, tempered with crushed stone and organic material
	 - Made using coiling technique, fired unevenly in open hearths
 - Products of the increasing neolithization of Europe, associated with spread of cultural changes experienced in SW Asia 10000 BCE, predate that process in Europe

### Subsistence
 - Hunting as the major activity, faunal assemblages show red and roe deer, wild boar, aurochs, elk, ibex were all important prey
 - Plants important too:
	 - Franchthi Cave, Greece: Preserved wild legumes, fruits, barley
 - Huge importance of shellfish
	 - May be preservation bias due to greater visibility of coastal sites
 - Deep sea fish like Tuna and nearshore fish are also more common. Open-sea fishing appears commonly practiced, some sea mammals are eaten as well (seals, dolphins, whales)

### Populations
 - Subsistence varied by region
 - Studies of human teeth and bone fragments:
	 - Western Mediterranean: Plants, fish, meat dominated. Cavity rates were high
	 - Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, Greece: Fish and other aquatic foods dominated, cavity rates were low. More nutritional stress, evidence for fish tapeworms and other intestinal parasites
 - Other skeletal studies suggest dietary insufficiency was overall rare. Little evidence for infectious disease, arthritis was common, tooth wear was severe
	 - Tooth wear may be related to using teeth as tools
 - Bit shorter than today: 5'6" for men, 5'1" for women

### Settlement
 - Increase in coastal settlements
 - Some lakeside sites are occupied, more important are those next to rivers and streams
 - High elevation sites in the Pyrenees, Alps, Apennines are abandoned
	 - Heightened treelines, decreased grazing lands for ibex
 - Site numbers in northern Europe increase, central Europe decrease

### Site Types
 - Huts of the Late Mesolithic resemble those of the earlier period
	 - Bark floors found in peat bogs, oval shapes pits dug into beaches
 - More variety in site type, illustrates more complex seettlement pattern
	 - Large sites on coast appear occupied year-round (many animal types)
	 - Smaller coastal sites are specialized (one animal type) and seasonally occupied
	 - Inland, large sites are seasonally occupied (summer or winter), smaller sites are short-term seasonal camps
 - People were becoming more sedentary, smaller sites were becoming more diverse and specializing in specific resources
	 - Pottery most often identified at these more sedentary sites

### Early Sedentism
 - Specialized camps use tools manufactured elsewhere
 - Interpretation: Tools made in residential sites, brought to satellite specialized camps
	 - Significant change in settlement organization between Early and Late Mesolithic
 - Overall, residential mobility lessened as some sites were occupied year-roun
 - Social Territories of the period reduce in size, artifact styles occur in smaller areas
	 - Jutland: Site affiliations interpreted from differentiated distribution of stone tools and decoration styles
	 - Several stylistic areas of beads and ornamentation all over Europe
	 - Social territories were around 100-200 km

### Exchange
 - Social territories shrinking, groups expanding contacts through exchange
	 - Reasons: Alliances? Insurance against subsistence problems? Lessen violence?
 - Lithic raw materials normally found within 10-20 km of their source
	 - Some stones, like Wommersum Quartzite, is found 250 km from its source (Belgium)
 - Mediterranean shells (pendants) are found up the Rhone Valley into Southern Germany over 600 km from the sea
 - Obsidian in the Franchthi Cave in Greece came from an Aegean island 150 km away
 - Newlithic materials also found mixed in with assemblages, looks like hunter-gatherers were trading with agriculturalists

### Ornaments and Art
 - Evidence for art and adornment is more abundant (vs Early Mesolithic)
	 - Antler axes, shafts, slotted bone daggers, harpoons, all frequently decorated with complex geometric designs
 - Pendants and beads are widespread in settlements and graves
	 - Materials: Amber, bone, stone, shells, fossils, animal teeth, even hazelnuts
 - Two new mediums of art become very popular: Pottery and Wood
	 - Wooden paddles from Danish bog of Tybrid Vig are exceptional
	 - One of Vis skis from Russia decorated with carved elk head
	 - Pointed-base jars have dotted and linear pattern
 - Rock art reappears in Europe after being absent for thousands of years
	 - Mostly on open cliff walls instead of deep caves
	 - Red with some black or tan
	 - Scenes are coherent, include humans (stick figures) and detailed animals. Scenes include hunting, dancing, fighting
		 - Dating these pieces is challenging, many may be early Neolithic

### Burial, Cemeteries, Social Complexity
 - Customs are diverse, many exampls
	 - Individuals are commonly placed on their backs (supine) or in flexed positions
	 - Few sitting upright or standing in shaft graves
	 - Multiple burials occur, not as common as individual burials
 - Half of all burials had grave goods, red ochre commonly placed around the head
	 - All age groups are represented
	 - Men typically buried with stone blades and daggers, women usually associated with jewelry
 - Most remarkable part: See the first true cemeteries of Europe
	 - Cabeco da Arruda cemetery in Protugal had 175 burials
	 - Cemeteries known all over Europe with 15-400 graves
 - Burials (especially cemeteries) are obvious guides to diet, health, disease. Also guides to social complexity, help understand how people categorized each other in the past
	 - Patterns based on age, sex, differences in status are usually discernable
 - Cemetery on Deer Island in Lake Onega (Russia):
	 - Analysis of grave goods show huge differences in quantity and type, might reflect status in life. Rich children's graves imply inherited status
	 - Some grave goods are distinguished by the types of goods, carved figurines and animal teeth. Imply lineages or clans
	 - Status implied by burial style: four individuals buried standing in shaft graves with many grave goods, could have been spiritual leaders or shamans.
 - Cemeteries are important places with cultural attachment between groups and territories
	 - Implies some sedentism
 - Numerous other aspects of Late Mesolithic mortuary behaviour has been discerned:
	 - Multiple burials of 4-8 individuals known from Zealand
	 - Individuals in Sweden were cremated, disarticulated before burial, at least one buried in canoe
	 - Dog burials are known, both with humans or alone
	 - Structure at Skateholm cemetery, filled with ash and sand, bounded by red ochre, associated with mortuary ceremonies
	 - Skull cult may have existed in central Europe, pits of disarticulated heads have been excavated. Pits of headless skeletons or disarticulated bones nearby
	 - Skull pit of Ofnet Cave show many men died from blunt trauma to the head. Some bodies showed evidence for slit throats, defleshing, microlith arrow wounds, cannibalism. Clear that interpersonal violence was a part of life in the Late Mesolithic
