### Primordium
 - Not the first attempt to understand human origins, every culture has a series of mythis to explain complexities of life.
	 - Creation myths
	 - Rituals and rites associated with these stories create a context for the symbolic life of a society.
 - This symbolic ife is the cornerstone of our existence, use it to establish sacred order of life between generations, tying together beings (people+gods), objects and landscapes

### Earliest Prehistorians
 - Example: Mouldboard plough in eighth century in Europe, increasing exposure to buried artifacts
	 - Folklore developed in medieval Europe around neolithic stone arrowheads found by random people (elf-shot/pixie arrows)
 - Earlier Example: Thunderstones in Europe. Romans found paleolithic bifaces, neolithic axe heads in the landscapes, buried in the corner of their buildings for magical protextion
	 - Middle ages, called heaven axes, believed to be weapons used during a war to drive out Satan
	 - Thunderstones in early modern period, thought to be formed by lightning strikes
	 - Questioned the origins of these rocks. Michele Mercati (1541-1593) suggested they were crafted by people and not lightning strikes
		 - When British, French explorers began to return from their travels the thunderstone myth was scientifically questioned
		 - Suggested they were stone tools, similarities with stone tools from North America, South Asia
		 - No ways to date these materials, sedimentary strata shows they are older than previously thought

### Three Age System
 - Danish antiquarian Christian Jurgensen Thomsen (1788-1865)
 - Organized artifact collections in National Museum of Denmark according to evolutionary development scheme called the Three-Age System
 - Recognized a historical progression of artifacts from Stone, to Bronze, then Iron
	 - Recognized associated tools and artifacts must also date to those periods

### Stratigraphic Method
 - End of 19th century, archaeology was a professional discipline. Modern excavation, analytical methods emerged
 - Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie (1853-1942), English Egyptologist
	 - Excavated sites layer by layer, collected all artifacts from each strata
 - Also arranged pottery shards by their evolving forms and styles (seriation), recognized importance of creating pottery typologies to determine relative dating of deposits

### Culture History
 - V. Gordon Childe (1892-1957) popularized the culture historical approach
 - Believed that artifact assemblages could represent a discrete societal system of belief and behaviours
 - Also recognized two important patterns in the prehistory of Europe and the Near East:
	 - *Agricultural Revolution*
	 - *Urban Revolution*
	 - Lacked the chronological control and global perspective to understand them further

### Chronology
 - Two main types of dating in archaeology:
	 - **Relative Dating**: traditional, relational, contextual, regional
		 - Three-Age and Seriation
		 - Often applied to nebulous region or microregion
		 - Must be double-checked and legitimized through synchronisms (when material cultures between two regions match)
	 - **Absolute Dating**: modern, calendrical, contextual, interregional
		 - Quantitative
		 - Often relevant only for certain sites or contexts
		 - Dendrochronological dating, C14 dating, Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS), Radiocarbon Dating, Thermoluminescence Dating, Potassium-Argon Dating
		 - In later periods, use artifacts like coins or epigraphy to also provide absolute dates

### Radiocarbon Dating
 - Carbon 14 (C14) dating is an analytical technique, measure radiocarbon from organic samples
 - Only measure samples 50k years old or younger
 - Carbon 14 in atmosphere is absorbed into plants, animals that eat plants
 - After death, carbon begins to decay into nitrogen 14
 - Carbon 14 has a half-life of 5730 years
	 - After 50k years all the carbon is gone
 - Uncalibrated ages are given in ranges of probability 
	 - Example: 2150 +- 100 BP (BP: Before Present, 1950 CE)
		 - Equal to 2050-2250 BP, meaning the sample dates somewhere between 300-100 BCE
		 - *cal BP*: BP date that has been calibrated, updated with modern techniques of radiocarbon dating

### Potassium Argon Dating
 - Some sites are too old for radiocarbon dating
 - Potassium (K) is abundant in earth's crust, has small number of radioactive 40K atoms
 - If the K is sufficiently heated (volcanic erupted) it starts to decay
 - For every 100 atoms that decay, 11% becomes argon (Ar) 40, inert gas
 - This gas escapes molten rock easily, when it recrystallizes it gets trapped
 - Sample of volcanic material can be analysed in a spectrometer, measure the 40Ar concentration accumulated since the rock formed, usually in millions of years ago (mya, also kya and ya, more ambiguous)
 - Calculating half-life isn't as straightforward as radiocarbon, altered by presence of other minerals in the rock

### Start of World Prehistory
 - Two things happened to kickstart study of global prehistory:
 - **Discovery of Radiocarbon Dating in 1949:**
	 - Willard Libby, JR Arnold at University of Chicago
	 - Allowed archaeologists to establish absolute dates at sites all over the world instead of relying on relative dates
	 - Learned that human societies developed at different times and in different places globally
	 - Allow us to look at rates of cultural change globally, inspiring work around the world
 - **Publication of World Prehistory by Grahame Clark in 1977:**
	 - First synthesis of prehistory that took advantage of radiocarbon chronologies and global research.
	 - Turned archaeology from provincial discipline to a worldwide science

### How We Study Prehistory
 - Multidisciplinary (geology, chemistry, geography, botany, zoology, climatology) with archaeology at its core
 - Archaeologists are a type of anthropologist who focuses on material culture of the past
	 - European Archaeologists would disagree, history subdivision

### How to Find Sites:
 - Some sites have been known for countless generations. Others have been buried by natural processes (mesoamerican sites swallowed by jungle)
 - Two basic methods for finding sites:
 - **Pedestrian Survey**: walking the surface and looking for signs of artifacts disturbed by ploughing, animal burrows, erosion
 - **Remote Sensing**: tools like satellite imagery or LiDAR scanning to find traces of sites from afar

### Area Excavation:
 - Layers are removed sequentially (stratigraphically) from the most recent (top) to the oldest (the bottom)
	 - Geological Law of Superposition
 - Some layers are cultural layers formed by human actions, while others are natural layers formed by geological processes
 - As artifacts are encountered, vertical and horizontal positions are recorded and distribution patterns emerge
 - Context is important, artifact patterning is essential in helping reconstruction of ancient lifeways from material culture
