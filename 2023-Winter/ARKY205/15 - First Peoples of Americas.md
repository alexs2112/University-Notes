### Antiquity of the Americas
 - 1908, George McJunkin saw bones near Folsom, New Mexico
	 - 1926, archaeologists from Denver Museum excavated
 - Found distinct spearpoint, named it Folsom
	 - 1927, another found embedded in rib of bison skeleton
 - Radiocarbon dating: Folsom points commonly dated to 11-10 kya

### Arrival of Humans in the New World
 - Controversial, sensitive narratives for indigenous peoples
 - Our narrative: Framed on basis of western scientific inquiry in conflict with myths and beliefs
 - One solution: Postprocessual acknowledges alternative narratives, space for constructive disagreement
 - Archaeologists debate three different models for human occupation of the Americas

### #1 The Clovis First Model
 - 1932, Blackwater Draw near Clovis, New Mexico
 - Discovered new leaf-shaped projectile point, flute extended part way along the body
	 - Found with mammoth and horse bones
 - Subsequently found all across western + southern North America
 - Represent earliest large-scale occupation of the Americas by humans
 - Clovis sites regularly date from between 13.4 and 12.7 kya
 - Resemble Solutrean points from Paleolithic Europe
	 - But removal of two basal flakes to create a flute
	 - Makes the points better to absorb shock of striking bone without breaking

### Beringia
 - Glacial advance: Bering Strait (Siberia and Alaska) became dry land
	 - Land bridge, Beringia, how ancestors of Clovis people first crossed into NA
	 - A steppe landscape covered in sage, grass, supported populations of mammoth, horse, and bison
 - End of last glaciation: Ice-free corridor opened between glaciers (western Cordilleran, eastern Laurentide) offering route from Alaska to Great Plains around 15 kya
	 - 1000 years for this corridor to become viable for human occupation with suitable plant and animal populations
 - Second coastal route also likely, from Alasak through BC, between 16-15 kya
 - Siberia -> Alaska: Expect to find well-developed fluted projectile point tradition in Siberia or Alaska before 13.5 kya (oldest Clovis sites)
	 - Earliest dated sites in Beringia: Broken Mammoth, central Alaska, 14-12.8 kya
		 - Nenana culture, tools include small bifacial triangular points, both bone and ivory needles and points
		 - No fluted points
	 - Tools and animals look like later sites on Siberian side
	 - Fluted points don't appear in these regions until 2000 years later

### Clovis Culture
 - Flute technology is a uniquely American invention
 - Some blade tools and flake tools also known, no evidence for any built features on Clovis
	 - Hearths and animal bones found frequently though, allow radiocarbon dating
 - Upward Sun River site in Alaska helps understand social organization:
	 - Burial of young girl, double infant burial discovered, dated to 11.5 kya
	 - Infant burial covered in red ochre, included three large bifacial points (not Clovis) and four antler rods
	 - Grave goods suggest infant had inherited social status
	 - Genetic analysis shows the two infants came from different mothers

### #2 Pre-Clovis Model
 - Early claims were dismissed, no single site is a confirmed case
 - Evidence for this model is growing
 - One of the most spectacular examples: Meadowcroft Rockshelter, Pennsylvania
	 - 11 natural levels excavated, in Stratum IIa near the bottom, assemblage of stone tools and carbon (from hearths) returned a date between 23-15.5 kya
 - Problem: Geologists and geoarchaeologists suggest the carbon was contaminated by older samples carried into rock shelter through groundwater from nearby coal beds in the bedrock

### Monte Verde
 - Southern tip of Chile, greatest challenger to the Clovis First Model
 - Objects date to around 15 kya, 1500 years before Clovis
	 - Layer of peat above the deposit was directly dated between 14-12.5 kya
 - Unusual site, extraordinary organic preservation
	 - Animal bones, preserved meat, rope, modified wood, organic plant material to build huts
 - Unmodified stones, claimed they were brought here by people
 - Human footprint
 - Controversy:
	 - Doubts immediately raised about the collected artifacts, nature of the site stratigraphy
	 - 1997, commission of prehistorians published article: date of 15 kya is valid
		 - Met with much hostility and criticism, one member recanted support
		 - Widely accepted by the scientific community
 - Until another site of this date is identified we can only say there is some evidence before Clovis, unlikely to be widescale or even successful

### Caverna de Pedra Pintada
 - Monte Verde is only South American site with evidence for Pre-Clovis occupation
	 - Other sites doubt on Clovis First model
 - Pedra Pintada cave in Brazilian Amazon, burnt seeds dated to 13-11.5 kya
	 - Stone tools, fish bones, red pigments were all found in these layers
 - Point: At the same time as Clovis cultures in North America, people lived in the Brazilian rain forest subsisting on plants and fish instead of megafauna
	 - Initial occupation of the Americas wasn't as simple as first thought

### #3 Early Arrival Model
 - Both Clovis First and Pre-Clovis agree that the first peoples in the Americas arrived in the last period of glacial advance (Wisconsin glaciation)
 - Small group of archaeologists suggest people arrived as early as 50 kya
	 - Earlies site in Siberia is 30 kya, dead mammoth in 45 kya in Siberian Arctic is intriguing
 - Old Crow in the Yukon claimed to have artifacts dating 50 kya, direct radiocarbon dating show it is 3 kya

### Some Contested Examples
 - **Monte Verde, Chile**: MV-I level, 33 kya, broken stones. Excavators suggest these are natural, not flaked by people
 - **Pedra Furada, Brazil:** Burnt patches of soil with broken rock identified in levels from 48-35 kya. Excavators argue these are controlled burning patches, critics suggest they are natural brush files and that the broken rock fell off nearby cliff and broke on impact
 - **Cerutti Mastodon Site, San Diego**: Fractured mammoth bone with unworked cobbles during road construction, 130 kya. Site very shallow driven over large construction equipment, trucks broke the bone instead of ancient people

### The Solutrean Hypothesis
 - Similarities between Solutrean and North American Paleoindian Clovis complex
	 - Upper Paleolithic peoples crossed the north Atlantic on sea ice and settled in eatern US
 - Lots of problems:
	 - Ice-edge following would be enormously difficult and illogical
	 - No evidence for seafaring at any Solutrean sites in Europe
	 - Aside from fine pressure-flakes points, no other Solutrean cultural evidence (like cave art)
	 - Politically: White supremacists, white Europeans were the original settlers of North America (even though Solutrean people likely brown skinned)
	 - Recent: DNA evidence suggests a Siberian origin for indigenous American populations

### Skeletal and Genetic Evidence
 - Very little human skeletal material hasbeen found before 9kya, none in context with Clovis points
	 - Kennewick Man (Washington) to 9200 ya
	 - Hoyo Negro Skeleton (Mexico) 13-12 kya
 - Genetic studies strongly support the Pre-Clovis model, East Asian origin, waves of migration
 - Possible explanation: Beringian Standstill Hypothesis
	 - Isolated East Asian population in Beringia 25 kya
	 - 16 kya when Pacific Coastal Route was open some dispersed south to Chile
	 - Later when the ice-free corridor opened, another group entered and became the Clovis culture

### Clovis People and Megafauna Extinction
 - Widespread extinction of megafauna occurs just after the arrival of people (13.25-12.9 kya), questioned if humans killed off thee massive animals
 - Only 14 sites show clear hunting of mastodons and mammoths (no other megafauna)
	 - Less about subsistence, more about social dynamics to prove hunting skill?
 - South American megafauna also went extinct, even less evidence for overhunting

### Extraterrestrial Impact
 - Last cold period of the last ice age called the Younger Drya
	 - Often associated with "Black Mat" layers, possible evidence for widescale burning
 - Massive extraterrestrial impact may have caused widespread burning and sudden climate change
	 - Causing megafauna extinction
 - Caution:
	 - Black mat layers may not be burning or massive impact, non-catastrophic sand-like micrometeorites due to prolonged meteor shower
	 - Megafauna extinction was gradual and not sudden
	 - No evidence that human populations shrank (continued to grow)
	 - Black mat layers may not be due to burning, just evidence for a higher watertable

### After Clovis: Late Paleoindian Period
 - Clovis -> Folsom, 12.6-12.1 kya
	 - Clovis ended abruptly
 - Change in hunting during this shift, mass kill sites emerge
	 - Olsen-Chubbuck site, Colorado
 - Folsom points are among the most sophistocated ever produced
	 - Razor thin, flute runs nearly the entire length of the point, very long
 - Paleoindian to Archaic Transition:
	 - Generally, archaic period characterised by stemmed projectile points and focus on hunting smaller game, along with more kill sites

### First Mound Builders
 - Thought indigenous peoples to be hunter-gatherers with simple social structures, inability to build monuments
 - Watson Brake mound site in Louisiana changed this notion
	 - Huge earthworks, dated to 5400 to 5000 ya in the Late Archaic
 - Enormous mound complex predates Stonehenge
 - Presumed simplicity of hunter gather societies needed to be reconsidered
