### Late Mesolithic
 - **Tools**: New trapezoidal form of microlith: Trapezes, triangular versions of microburin technique practically disappear
	 - Refined blade techniques with larger, more regular forms, better as arrowheads (cut tissues rather than only penetrating)
		 - **Earliest**: Franchthi Cave, Greece
	 - Flaked axe heads more common, mace heads (weighted digging stick) for finding roots, hammerstones breaking bones/nuts
	 - Polished artifacts appear, stronger than flaked versions, edges can be straightened to avoid constant breakage
	 - Skis and sleds found in a bog in Russia to facilitate winter travel
	 - Fishing intensified with wooden traps, dugout canoes in much greater quantities (rare hearths for lighting, ballast stones)
 - **European Ceramic Vessels**: End of Mesolithic, sherds from Ertebolle sites, pointed bases to be placed in sand or bottom of boat
	 - Pots from native clays, fired unevenly in open hearths
 - **Subsistence**: Hunting and gathering all important, huge importance of shellfish (possible preservation bias), open-sea fishing
 - **Populations**: Subsistence varied by region, dietary insufficiency was overall rare, arthritis common, tooth wear was severe (tools?)
 - **Settlement**: Increase in coastal settlements, some lakeside sites are occupied, high elevation sites are abandoned
 - **Site Types**: More variety, complex settlement pattern (larger coastal sites: year round, smaller sites: specialized+seasonal)
	 - People becoming more sedentary, smaller sites more diverse and specialized in specific resources
	 - Specialized camps used tools manufactured elsewhere, made in residential sites, brought to specialized camps
 - **Exchange**: Social territories shrinking, expanding contacts through exchange (allies? insurance? less violence?), up to 600km trade
 - **Ornaments and Art**: More abundant evidence for art and adornment. Wood and Pottery now very popular mediums of art
	 - Pendants and beads widespread in settlements and graves. Rock art reappears in Europe on open cliff walls
	 - Tools frequently decorated with complex geometric designs
 - **Burials**: Customs are diverse, half of all burials had grave goods with red ochre, first true cemeteries of Europe

### Age of Agriculture
 - **Three Broad Forms**: Domestication of plants + animals; New harvesting + processing + storage tools; Sedentism
	 - Multiple places develop agriculture independent of each other at different times
	 - Critical variable: Same human intellect required that resulted in our mass colonization of the world
 - **Myths**: Some think in terms of myths, Garden of Eden -> chose agriculture -> fell from garden -> terrible state ever since
 - **Perspectives**: Important stage, greater control of food supply, enhance population growth and social complexity
 - **Population Pressure**: Led hunter gatherers to switch to farming, limit of what their resources could support. **No evidence**
 - **Co-Evolutionary Theories**: Agriculturalists must dominate crops and livestock, force predictability, we're dependent on them
 - **Social Theories**: Social experiment? Maybe result of social competition and feasting, still requires human decision making
 - **Environmental Theories**: Short term shifts in climate, when they found these new ways of getting food they expanded them
 - **Hunter Gatherers**: Most environments could only support small groups of people, populations increased when it became warmer and more supportive. Harder to move into new areas, need to exploit wider ranges of food more efficiently (H-Gs more complex)
	 - Complexity conditions: Limited population movement, abundant resources, population growth
	 - Increasing population densities, specialized toolkits for more varied diets, food storage and preservation systems
 - **Consequences of Food Production**: Spread of food production around the world took about 8000 years
	 - Higher populations, territory required is much smaller than hunter-gatherers, sedentism predates adoption of agriculture, food production led to landscape alteration, increasing population controlled by new factors (disease, water, etc)
	 - Farming brought decline in human life with less leisure, sedentary lives vulnerable to disease, stuck doing farming
 - **Animal Domestication**: Implies genetic selection, emphasizing special features of continuing use for humans
	 - 3 vital elements: Constraints on animal movements; constraints on animal breeding; control of feeding to shape generations
	 - Most likely: Long period of herd management before full domestication
	 - Archaeology: Only evidence of domestication is bones, early domesticates almost the same as wild varieties at this stage
 - **Plant Cultivation**: Far fewer wild plants domesticated compared to those foraged. First had unique attributes
	 - Wild v Domestic Wheat: Wild has brittle rachis for natural spread, domestic has tough rachis to survive harvest for replanting
 - **Tools of Domestication**: Technology is just as important as new foods. Settled life leads to lasting styles of substantial houses
 - **Storing Food**: Agriculture is seasonal, farmers need to carry grain and store water (gourds, clay vessels, pots vs skin/leather bags)
 - **Handheld Tools**: Simple hoes appear to help farming, new emphasis on axes/adzes to clear wild vegetation and weeds
	 - Flint from Grand Pressigny (France) and Obsidian are highly valued stones, more dependant on raw exotic materials, widespread long distance trade

# Origins of Farming
### Southwest Asia
 - **Fertile Crescent**: Dry summers, cool wet winters
 - **Stages of Agrictulture**: Process with distinct stages
	 - Kebaran hunter-gatherers, Natufian (architecture), Early Neolithic (villages, goats), Late Neolithic (pottery, cattle + pigs)
 - **Kebaran Period**: Highly mobile, no domesticates, stone bladelets shaped into geometric shapes, ritual life with small art objects
 - **Natufian Period**: Earliest stone buildings, no domesticates, **Lunate (crescent) bladelets** as first ground tools
 - **Pre-Pottery Neolithic A**: Farming communities, no clay vessels, low crop cultivation on floodplains, people anchored to lands
 - **Pre-Pottery Neolithic B**: Large village societies, trading centers with imported materials, diverse economies, some H-Gs
 - **Late Neolithic**: Ecological degradation by deforestation causing sharp reduction in villages, shift from central to dispersed settlement. Symbolic culture changes: Stylized human figurines dominate, skull-removal and ornamentation ends
 - **First Farmers**: Cultivating wild cereals to supplement foraging diets experimentally.
	 - End of Younger Dryas: Cultivation all over the Fertile Crescent, full domestication with constant sowing and harvesting
 - **Ritual**: Huge number of symbolic artifacts in early Neolithic, ritual objects in households or temples. Three categories:
	 - Hidden rituals (pits, under floors); Display rituals (meant to be seen, structures); Daily life rituals (simple clay figurines)
 - **Gobekli Tepe**: Four (likely more) semi-subterranean structures with T-shaped pillars in the middle
	 - Pillars have carvings of wild animals, no domesticates, some have arms and are meant to look anthropomorphic
	 - Constructed by hunter-gatherers, not farmers, need a ton of communal labour, unsure if people lived here or if its a shrine
	 - Important spot for religious practices, people came here to reinforce and celebrate their beliefes
 - **Catalhoyuk**: Clearest view of early farming, source of good obsidian and many villages coalesced here to utilize it
	 - Densely occupied proto-city was established, many houses (166) constructed, no public buildings or cemeteries
	 - Houses with elaborate symbolism, paintings and body parts installed in walls, ancestors buried directly under house floors
	 - Secular and symbolic, some domestic objects deposited below house floors, wall paintings for interacting with ancestors
 - **Late Neolithic Technological Changes**: Pottery manufacture, decorative elements (polished clay surface, red pigment paint)
	 - Lithic blades disappear, arrowheads become rare (hunting declines)
 - [For test, familiarize yourself with artifact photos and site photos from 9.2]

### Africa
 - **The Nile**: Ecological diversity through arid and harsh desert, landscape dependent on rainfall far upstream
	 - Extreme case of circumscription: Limits of inhabitable land are very clearly defined
 - **Hunter-Gatherers**: Flexible lifestyle required to adjust to constant fluctuations in flood levels
	 - Sites adjacent to dried stream beds that would fill with water during floods
 - **Wadi Kubbaniya**: Live alongside marshy floodplain after flooding, fish sluggish during flooding, hundreds caught with bare hands
	 - Flood rising and retreating would change sustenance and lifeways, flood was variable, food resources were uncertain
 - **Jebel Sahaba Cemetery, Sudan**: Many individuals killed by stone tools, showed signs of violent lives, first signs of human warfare
	 - Groups had to settle around permanent water supplies, battled other groups as natural resources dwindled/changed
 - **Sahara in the Early Holocene**: Rainfall increased, low areas became grasslands and shallow lakes
	 - After 6000 BCE: drought cycles grew and lakes quickly shrank again. People started turning to domesticates, small insurance
	 - Simplest agricultural methods, in a few centuries domesticated wheats became staples, became dependent on crops
 - **Fayum Depression**: No cereals, small cultivations and animal herds, moved w/ variable water levels, too unpredictable for villages
 - **Earliest Farmers in the Nile**: After 2500 BCE, extremely arid, people had to get very close to the water, when flood levels returned all these early farming sites were buried. Movement of farmers, nomadic groups resulted in very high cultural diversity
 - **Dawn of Complexity**: 3500 BCE, inhabitants living almost entirely off agriculture
	 - No large scale irrigation as farmers followed the movements of the water, planting in shallow basins and swamps
	 - Irrigation technology emerges 3000 BCE, before that could watch natural patterns, exploit variable environment
 - **Taming Saharan Herds**: Wild oxen move in smaller herds, disciplined about food and water.
	 - Easier for humans to move among them, predicting habits and culling the herds (resulting in biological changes)
	 - Herders began selecting for different cattle traits, taming them brought stability to their food supply
	 - Demanding animals, require water and large grazing lands. The secret is to pick the right grazing land
	 - Tsetse fly and its disease limited long term human settlement, herders had to keep moving south

### Asia and the Pacific (10.1)
 - **Rice and Millet**: Rice was earliest plant domesticated in the Yangtze Valley, millet domesticated in colder Yellow River
 - **Domesticating Rice**: Covers many millenia, traced by botanists through abscission layer on the seed
	 - First sites: Lower Yangtze region, built dams to trap runoff water to create rice paddies
	 - Sedentary life in the Holocene in low-lying seasonally flooded environments, cultivation response to population growth
	 - Likely started in Southern China, warm early Holocene allowed rice to colonize marshlands
 - **Path to Complexity in Southern China**: Rice only part of broad-spectrum hunting and gathering
	 - Concentration in wealth, trends towards ranked societies after more sophisticated agricultural societies formed
 - **Agricultural Environment in Northern China**: Millet was cultivated here instead of rice
	 - During Pleistocene Glaciations: Loess sediment formed over the north (fine, soft aeolian deposit, nutritious, easily tilled)
 - **First Farmers in the North**: Two scenarios: 
	 - People on Yellow River passed long experimental phase before developing distinctive techniques
	 - Agriculture developed in the South and knowledge about it moved North
	 - Distinctive cord-decorated pottery, perhaps this tradition links it to the south
	 - Best known early farmers: Yangshao culture, self-contained river villages to cultivate millet
 - **Spread of Early Farming in North China**: Yangshao culture expanded along river valleys, moving agriculture all around N China
	 - Some think roots of modern Chinese cuisine and language originate with the Yangshao
	 - Famous Longshan culture with earth walled settlements, partly use irrigation and rice cultivate, less dependent on millet
 - **Holocene Japan**: Settled along coasts and lakeshores, exploited maritime food resources, sedentism near coasts
 - **The Jomon Culture**: Ceramic pots for food preparation to exploit food resources more fully
	 - Best known for elaborate and early ceramic industry, high sophistication with ritual pots and wooden houses
	 - Eventually adopted to deliberately growing crops and taming animals, no early agriculture
 - **Khok Phanom Di Site**: Thailand, Large and wealthy rice farming community, poor soil for cultivation (maybe imported)
	 - **Burial**: The Princess of Khok Phanom Di, many pots on a pyramid of clay cylinders over female skeleton
		 - Interred died at age 30, covered in 121k shell ornaments and pottery anvil, likely a potter in life who grew wealthy from trading amongst travelers passing through, likely an early ruler and roots of later Queendoms in Thailand, Cambodia
 - **Agriculture on the Islands**: Instead of rice cultivation, root crops like taro instead became staples in the Philippines
	 - First settlements: Homogenous groups, canoes playing major role in intervillage exchange

### The Americas
 - **Origins of Maize**: Central role in many American farming communities
	 - Single original center of domestication in the highlands of Mexico of teosinte grass, origin of Maize
 - **Mesoamerica**: Guila Naquitz, Oaxaca Valley: Show squash was the earliest domesticated plant in Mexico
	 - Earliest maize in Tehuacan Valley shows gradual increase in size, tough rachis shows clear domestication
 - **Peruvian Agriculture**:
	 - **Food Production in the High Andes**: Mountainous highlands, harsh lowlands, need to settle in multiple verticle environments by modifying the landscape with terraces, encourage plants and animals to adapt to new elevations
		 - Extended range, still struggled to maintain settlement outside natural faunal and floral ranges
	 - **Staples**: Great variety of wild plants and animals, only a few were domesticated, agriculture to control food availability
	 - **Peruvian Coast**: Narrow desert shelf cut by small river valleys (oases with rich soil, vegetation, good water)
		 - Valleys where cultivation began, series of micro-environments of water and land resources
		 - El Nino countercurrent flows for a year, irregularly, major changes every 25 years, super unpredictable
	 - **Early Settlement**: People moved right to the coastal edge, living in more lasting dwellings with deep-sea fishing
	 - **Early Domesticates**: Cultivated some plants (squashes) and kept llamas near simple hut sites
 - **Arrival of Maize**: Settlements more permanent, agriculture remains secondary to fishing, maize changes Peruvian social structures
	 - Requires large irrigated fields, centralized organization of labor, crop yields expand and social stratification emerges
	 - More housing, large ceremonial pyramids, stone platforms and temples emerge, form basis of later Peruvian civilization
	 - First Maize: Chapalote form, genetically diverse but small, crossbred with wild teosinte to produce more productive maize
 - **New Maize**: Chapalote maize could not be relied on entirely, lacks vital amino acides in beans and squash
	 - Different maize: Maiz de ocho, key to development in the SW, larger and more productive, flowered earlier
	 - After 500 BCE, beans arrived, planted under maize to return nitrogen to the soil 
		 - Late arrival -> why maize dependence didn't occur sooner
	 - Eventually becomes central in the SW, shift accompanied by growing sedentism and further investment in crops
 - **Eastern North American Mound Builders**: New ideological foundations with mortuary ritual and ancestors
	 - Earliest mound: Watson Brake, predates arrival of agriculture by 1000 years, not necessary step towards social complexity
	 - Predates stonehenge, required significant amount of social cohesian and communal labour, local materials
 - **Early Woodland Adena Period**: Seasonal camps relying on hunting, gathering, cultivating squash and starchy plants
	 - Burial mounds and impressive earthworks for ceremony (not defense), geometric shapes, got larger over time
 - **Hopewell Tradition**: Small settlements with hunting, gathering, planting, distinctive stone tools
	 - Applied much wealth and creativity on objects and rituals related to the afterlife
	 - Hopewell mounds are more elaborate than Adena, Mound City (Ohio) is enormous, 32 acres w/ 24 mounds
	 - Housefolds concentrated around burial mounds
 - [Familiarize with site pictures, probably Watson Brake or Mound City?]

### Europe
 - **Origins of Farming**: Earliest evidence for agriculture comes from the Aegean area
	 - Keep wild grasses predictable, Mesolithic people would cut down trees, partially domesticated sheep
	 - SW Asian domesticates arrived here, knowledge of farming arrived with trade, introduction of domesticated plant species
	 - Greece is mountainous and farmland is poor, unlikely domesticates originated there, **Anatolian immigrants makes sense**
 - **Starčevo–Körös–Criș Pottery**: Earliest Neolithic culture out of Greece, unique barbotine painted pottery (raised linear patterns)
	 - **Red Hair Goddess** Venus figurine with the fattest ass
 - **Impressed/Cardial/Cardium Pottery**: Named for use of heart-shaped shell to make a series of designs
 - **Farming in Central Europe**: Earliest farmers may have been migrants, linear potter (LBK) derived from Koros culture (east)
	 - No complex late Mesolithic forager societies to develop Neolithic traits
 - **Linear Pottery Culture** (LBK, Linearbandkeramik): One of the most intensively studied cultures of the European Neolithic
	 - Three attributes: Ornamentation of ceramics consist of incised lines; polished adze-axe; longhouse communities
	 - Earliest farmers distinguised by the presence of LBK-like pottery
	 - LBK sites found on loess, while Mesolithic peoples preferred sandy areas (farmers and foragers able to avoid each other)
 - **Farming in Early Neolithic**: No evidence for plows, used digging sticks and flint sickles, limited to smaller fields
	 - Unpredictable farming with poor yields
	 - In Greece: Sheep/goats dominate, may have add ritual significance (clay figures)
 - **LBK Sustenance**: Slash-and-burn (swidden) agriculture, forced to move periodically by soil exhaustion
	 - Analysis suggests fixed plot agriculture was most common, cultivated fields within 1km of settlements
	 - First time milk and cheese consumption are archaeologically visible, domestic animals easier to milk, cheese preserves well
 - [Familiarize with artifact photos (probably Red Hair Goddess) and site illustrations, 10.3]

### Readings
 - For Hodder 2022: focus on the terminology he uses to discuss organizational differences at Catalhoyuk
	 - Molar: Emphasize the whole of something, unifiable, totalizable, organizable
		 - Early + Middle phase, highly complex overlay of demands on constituent units (over-coding, hierarchical)
	 - Molecular: Constituent parts, composed of particles
		 - Mode of articulation allowing for greating independence, autonomy of parts (egalitarian)
 - For Zeder 2011: review all the plant species she discusses
	 - New archaeologial insight into plant domestication:
		 - Cereals: Einkorn, Rye, Barley, Wheat

			 - Emmer?
 - For Jones et al 2021: be sure to understand their conclusions
	 - Plant evidence first to show ecological processes played significant part in plant domestications, origins of agriculture
	 - Size is important factor in selection of crop progenitors, seed size != yield, bigger seeds not of human selection
	 - Crop progenitors germinate faster, selected for suite of traits to give advantage in resource abundant environments
		 - Rapid germination, early growth rate as particularly advantageous attributes of early selection
	 - Unintended selctive pressures: Plant size and photosynthetic capacity, coevolutionary factors rather than intended
	 - Pace of domestication dependent on relative roles of human intent and selective pressures
 - For Fuller et al 2011: focus on their core argument
	 - Instead of rapid plant domestication in a single area, numerous parallel processes of domestication across region
	 - PPNA cultivation was widespread, early stage on slow millenial road to domestication and agriculture
	 - Evidence from Near East indicates complex mosaic of crop origins and animal domestications
 - For Morales et al. 2013: focus on the nature of the archaeological site itself
	 - Ifri Oudadane: Maquia-forest type of small trees, human activities responsible for deforestation, depletion of resource
	 - Cave divided into 2 occupation periods: Epipaleolithic period, possible Early Neolithic (pottery, domestic bones)
		 - Neolithic further divided into three sublayers (Early Neolithic A, B, C)
	 - LIkely seasonally occupied, foragers with high marine diet, mostly for processing+consumption of marine resources
