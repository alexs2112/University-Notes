### Review of Complex States
 - Factors:
	 - Societies based on cities, with large, very complex social organization and wide territories
	 - Economies based on the centralized accumulation of capital and social status through tribute and taxation
		 - Long-distance trade and division of labor (with craft specialization) are characteristic
	 - Advances toward formal record keeping, science, mathematics, some form of written script
	 - Impressive public buildings and monumental architecture
	 - Some form of all-embracing state religion where the ruler plays a leading role
 - These factors made possible by leaders having control over violence, information
	 - Maintain power through individual charisma
 - For most archaeologists: At least two required to be considered a state-level society

### Does Easter Island Qualify as a State:
 - Monumental stone heads (Moai) dot the island of Rapa Nui, why did these people construct them?
 - Competing leaders built Moai during times of prosperity, fueled cycle of competitive constructions
	 - Very fragile ecosystems, deforestation required resulted in decimation of resources
	 - During environmental stress: Increased levels of violence
 - Not a state society, no control over violence or information
	 - Much political complexity, leaders were charismatic, an enigmatic society

### Ancestral Puebloans
 - Around 700 CE in American SW: Massive increase in social complexity
	 - Southern Arizona: Hohokam culture, largest site of Snaketown (two ball courts, large-scale irrigation)
 - Around 800 CE: Ancestral Puebloans peoples emerge in the Four Corners region (Pueblo I)
	 - Most famous locale: Chaco Canyon, San Juan Basin of New Mexico
	 - Center of regional settlement network
	 - Contained several huge multistoried Great Houses
 - Pueblo Bonito is the largest Great House in Chaco Canyon
	 - Large circular subterranean chambers: Kivas, structures with religious significance
	 - Grew over the centuries, dry climate preserved wooden beams in the floor and ceilings, dendrochronology here is remarkably precise
	 - Construction began around 800 CE, complex reached full size between 1000-1100 CE (Pueblo II)
 - Number of rooms suggests a large settlement, but few hearths and little domestic activities
	 - High number of kivas suggests this was a ceremonial center, population ~100 instead of 1200
	 - Function changed over time, originally elite residence, then ceremonial. Demonstrates elite power was partly derived from their role in religious ceremonies
 - Size of Pueblo Bonito suggests political leadership, 200k trees, 800k hours of work
	 - Social inequality clear from Rooms 33 and 38
 - Some interesting observations:
	 - Looks like elites controlled trade networks required to get turquoise, jet, and macaws
	 - Pottery hsows they were drinking cacao and ilex vomitoria (holly plant to make caffeinated drink), probably used in communal context
 - **Chacoan Network**: Many Great Houses in Chaco Canyon, roads linking many of them
	 - Chaco Canyon was at the center of this network, no evidence valley people controlled anyone outside it
	 - Maybe it was a central location in a wider landscape, goods accumulated due to cycles of feasting when it was briefly occupied throughout the year
 - **Mesa Verde**: Small communities emerged here with links to the ceremonial center
	 - Severe drought from 1130 to 1180 (early Pueblo III) led to depopulation of the San Juan Basin, many people migrated out of Chaco Canyon to Mesa Verde
		 - Led to intensification in agriculture, deforestation to help build pueblos
	 - Massive multistory buildings emerged in places like Cliff Palace, stone towers built as testimony to increasing warfare brought on from severe drought of the 12th century (1276-1299)
		 - Violence + cannibalism are documented
	 - Interpretation: Ancestral Puebloans experienced environmental stress that destroyed their food supply, most groups migrated south, this area mostly abandoned into the contact period
 - Chaco was not a town, other Great Houses were equally as sparsely occupied, lots of effort in building them
	 - Leaders were powerful, no evidence their power included control over violence or information
	 - Violence associated with the collapse of the society, would it have evolved into a state if droughts had not occurred?

### Mississippian Culture
 - Hopewell exchange system ended around 400 CE, mound building of Middle Woodland period was interrupted, involved maize cultivation, abandonment of long-distance connections
 - Signs of complexity (and mound building) reemerge around 800 CE as part of Mississippian culture
	 - Increasing sedentism (800-1000 CE) and growing reliance on maize agriculture
	 - Growing maize surplus occurred as charismatic chiefs began emerging in surrounding villages
	 - Led rapidly to population growth and concentration in major centers during Middle Mississippian period (1200-1400 CE)
 - **Cahokia**: Largest, most famous site, monumental ceremonial complex (1000-1400 CE)
	 - Huge, 4.5km, an hour to walk from end to end, landscape of rich meandering stream channels, wetlands, swamps. Explored by Henry Brackenridge (1813)
	 - Principle mound: Monk's Mound
 - **Organization at Cahokia**: Monk's Mound, south of Cahokia Creek, north of flattened Grand Plaza
	 - Small clusters of settlement surround the plaza, poor preservation makes estimates imprecise
	 - Most researchers say it is not a city, no administration, service areas, or sense of community
 - **Governing Cahokia**: Biggest challenge: Understanding political organization
	 - Two sides of the debate: Powerful chiefdom with elites who ruled over other settlements in the American Bottom (verge of becoming a state).
	 - Or, elite of Cahokia were simply the most powerful group among many competing chiefdoms, power limited to the site itself and no surrounding communities
	 - Look for signs of inequality to try to unravel this problem
 - **Inequality at Cahokia**: Most vivid evidence: Mound 72, south of the Grand Plaza
	 - Hundreds of complete arrowheads over the burial of a man on platform made from 20k shell beads
	 - Other individuals found there, likely sacrificed to accompany the main burial
	 - Looks like wealth is concentrated in the hands of few people, elites could call on skilled craftworkers and maybe controlled the lives of their subjects
 - **Feasting at Cahokia**: Mound 51, stratified sequence of botanical+faunal+pottery remains, large-scale feasting
	 - Grand Plaza was the site of massive feasting events, 30k people could have fit in here
	 - If true: Power stemmed from elite ability to organize large numbers of people through feasting, rather than bureaucracy and the threat of force
	 - Another possibility: Setting for sporting events, polished granite discs part of a game called chunky
 - **Religion at Cahokia**: Bird iconography is popular
	 - Nearby communities also suggest the ritual significance of birds from feasting (summer solstice)
	 - Birds treated differently than other animals in the assemblage (buried with more care)
		 - Ritual role as creatures of the upper world
 - **Southeastern Ceremonial Complex**: Cahokia at the center of the SECC (900-1250/1350 CE)
	 - Cultural traits across most of the eastern US during this period included:
		 - Series of artistic motifs depicting cosmology, supernatural beings of the Above, Middle, Under World
		 - Ubiquity of the birdman symbol in a variety of forms, associated with warfare, games, family dynasty
		 - Red Horn and his sons: Mythic cycle associated with great deeds tied to peace pipe ceremonies
		 - Great Serpent depicted as creature of Under World at war with Thunderers (birdman), beings of the Above World
	 - Iconography declines as Cahokia is abandoned
 - **Decline of Cahokia**: Increased warfare, political turmoil, population migrations during Late Mississippian (1400-1540 CE)
	 - Population disperses to other centers, decline in mount building, communal feasting, increase in construction of defensive structures
	 - Signs of severe social stress emerge from most sites around 1500 CE
	 - Possible explanation: Drought reduced maize agriculture yields at the same time as deforestation and overhunting by huge populations forced populations to disperse
 - Climate scientiests recognized period of regional cooling in North Atlantic region (1400-1800 CE) called Little Ice Age. Winters became more severe, summer heat declined, increasing dryness
	 - Early in this shift, slight increase in dryness devastated ecological balance at Chaco Canyon
 - Moreso than Pueblo Bonito, Cahokia was very close to emerging as a state like the Maya
	 - Lacked appearance of authority integrated more fully into social and spiritual life
	 - If not for Little Ice Age -> European contact, this might have occurred
