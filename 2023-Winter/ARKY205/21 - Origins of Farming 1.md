 - Ribbon of Mediterranean climate through Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Iran
	 - Fertile Crescent: Dry summers, cool wet winters
 - Adoption of agriculture was a process with distinct stages:
	 - Kebaran hunter-gatherers subsisted on range of plant and animal resources, no domestication
	 - Natufian peoples built architecture and used elaborate material culture, no domestication
	 - Early Neolithic people lived in villages, farmed lentils and peas, domesticated goats
	 - Late Neolithic peoples created pottery, less densely settled sites, domesticated cattle + pigs

### Climate Change and Adaptation
 - Deep sea cores and pollen studies suggest climate was cool and dry from 21k - 16k BCE
	 - Fertile Crescent was dry steppe with forest along the Turkish coast uring Kebaran period
 - After 16k BCE: Climate warmed and forests expanded. Rich in animals and plants
 - Early Holocene: Climate shifted in favour of the Mediterranean: Warm arid summers, cool wet winter
	 - Favoured cereal grasses, moved north into this environment
 - Younger Dryas cold snap (10800 BCE) made the area cooler and dryer
	 - Main trigger for people to begin turning to managing wild grasses (emmer, barley, rye, millet)
 - Hunter Gatherers (Natufian) use variety of strategies to handle natural phenomena. In SW Asia, stayed and adapted to drier times
 - Northern Levant: Forest declined, cereal grasses were decimated, a lot more people in this region than before and needed to intensify exploitation strategies
 - Around 9500 BCE, some groups began growing wild cereals as a way to increase supplies

### Kebaran/Geometric Kebaran Period
 - Between 25000 and 15000 BP, people lived in small hunter-gatherer encampments with no evidence for domesticates
 - Stone bladelets, later shaped into geometric shapes
 - These people were highly mobile
 - Ohalo in Israel: Preserved under Sea of Galilee, six huts with skeleton next to stone circle
 - Wadi Mataha in Jordan: Several skeletons, one man face down and hog tied with skull smashed, broken stone bowl and long flint knife at the grave, violent event
 - Hard to understand ritual life, art objects are rare but some small stone plaques with geometric art

### Natufian Period
 - Earliest stone buildings between 15k and 12k BP, no sign of domesticates
 - Stone tool technology: Lunate (crescent-shaped) bladelets for mounting on bone knife or sickle, first ground tools in the region
 - Houses appear to have been wooden or brush superstructures on stone foundations. Shrunk rapidly in size and number during Younger Dryas cold period
 - People buried under the floors of the houses during this period, heads were removed
	 - Burial contained shell necklaces, traded from the Mediterranean and Red Sea (distant)

### Pre-Pottery Neolithic A
 - Pre-Pottery groups (PPN) between 12k and 6k BP
	 - Key feature: Farming communities that don't use clay vessels
 - PPNA lasted 40 generations (12k-10.5k BP) with clear roots in Natufian society
	 - Most sites were small (minus Jericho, Netiv Hagdud)
	 - Oval mud-brick huts with grain storage bins, flint blade sickles for harvesting
 - PPNA people at Jericho built massive walls around their settlement, including a tower with rock-cut ditch, one of the oldest stone monuments in the world
	 - Why did they need these walls? Defended from competition or flood-control works?
	 - Possibly an exchange center
 - Hunted gazelles, aurochs, pigs, goats. No domesticated varieties found in faunal assemblages
 - Small scale crop cultivation on floodplains, had grain storage, no domesticated plants
 - Settlements contain communal buildings for ritual or assemblies
 - Part of a major social change: People were becoming anchored to their lands

### Pre-Pottery Neolithic B
 - During favourable conditions of Younger Dryas (10500 BP): Large village societies developed in the northern Levant and beyond
	 - PPNB spread into Cyprus and Anatolia, bringing large-scale permanent villages based now on domestication (both agriculture and herding)
 - Large settlements were trading centers with imported materials and exotic items after 10k BP
	 - Farmers were using obsidian from Anatolia, turquoise from Sinai, seashells from the Mediterranean and Red Sea
	 - This interaction sphere included diverse economies
		 - Some people relied on cereals, others on lentils
		 - By 9000 BP, most animals oon sites were sheeps and goats
		 - Around 8100 BP, climate became more arid and this interaction sphere collapsed
 - Hunter-gatherers were still living alongside these farmers in large numbers

### The First Farmers
 - Evidence in SW Asia is meager. These people were cultivating wild cereals to supplement foraging diets experimentally
 - By the end of the Younger Dryas: Cultivation was practiced all over the Fertile Crescent
	 - Archaeobotanists think it took between 1-2k years of experimenting with wild cereals before non-shattering ears and increased grain sizes appear
	 - Full domestication needed constant sowing and harvesting of these species
 - Don't fully know why domesticated cereals came into use.
	 - Diverse practice, took many centuries
	 - Was a logical culmination of risk-reducing strategies used over a long time

### Early Neolithic: Birth of the Gods?
 - Huge number of symbolic artifacts associated with PPN sites in early Neolithic
 - Ritual objects found in households, also in sacred precincts or temples
 - Ritual is often discussed in three categories:
	 - Hidden rituals: Objects hidden in pits or under floors (includes plastered skulls, plaster figures)
	 - Display rituals: Objects or structures meant to be seen (like Jericho tower, Gobekli Tepe pillars)
	 - Daily life rituals: Objects handled daily with some symbolic meaning (simple clay figurines)

### Mesopotamia and the Zagros
 - Developments east of sites like Jericho were parallel but independent
	 - Hilly highland areas where agricultural conditions were less favourable
 - Pleistocene: Humans lived in the lowlands, probably where agriculture started in the Holocene
 - As climate ameliorated, groups moved into the uplands, following Zagros mountain valleys into the open steppe
 - Ideal for herding sheep and goats, may have developed here earlier than other parts of SW Asia

### Early Farmers in Anatolia
 - Turkey was a diverse and favourable highland and lowland environment for settlement in the early Holocene
 - Landscape of experimentation of farming
 - Cayonu Tepesi: Numerous rectangular houses surrounding a large open center with three distinct buildings
	 - One had stone built cells in the bottom, crammed with human bones of at least 400 people
	 - Flat stone slab with traces of animal and human blood
	 - Captives or sacrifices?

### Gobekli Tepe
 - One of the earliest and most important sites from Neolithic Turkey (9600-8000 BCE, PPNA and B)
 - Site consists of four (likely more) semi subterranean structures two T-shaped pillars in the middle and as many as 12 around the edges
 - Pillars had carvings of wild animals but no domesticates
	 - Some pillars have arms, clearly meant to look anthropomorphic
 - Most amazing thing: People that built these structures are hunter-gatherers, not farmers
	 - Capable of amassing enough communal labour to build these structures
 - Not entirely sure if anyone lived here full time with residential structures, or if it was just a shrine
	 - Lots of wild gazelle bones, suggesting people coming here seasonally
 - Important spot for spiritual observance or religious practices. People cam ehere to reinforce and celebrate their beliefs

### The Late Neolithic
 - End of PPN (8500 BP): Sharp reduction in villages in most of SW Asia
	 - Collapse looks like the result of ecological degradation associated with deforestation
	 - Short collapse period sometimes called PPNC
 - Most of the large sites in Israel, Jordan, Syria, Eastern Turkey are abandoned
 - Some think this period saw a shift from central to dispersed settlements, focused on grazing herds with less dense farming
 - Symbolic culture changes: Stylized human figurines dominate, skull-removal and ornamentation ends

### Catalhoyuk
 - Clearest view of early farming
 - Central southern Turkey
 - Source of much good obsidian, villages coalesced here to monopolize it
 - By 7500 BCE, densely occupied proto city was established
 - Many houses built of sundried bricks set against each other, no streets, access via a flat roof above
 - Rebuilt 18 times over 1400 years, last occupied in 6000 BCE
 - 166 houses excavated
 - No public buildings or cemeteries here, all aspects of daily life occurred in these houses (both secular and ritual)
 - Houses demonstrate elaborate symbolism, paintings and body parts installed in walls
 - Instead of cemeteries, ancestors buried directly under the floors of the houses
 - Blurring here between secular and symbolic, some domestic objects deposited below house floors while wall paintings may have been ways of interacting with ancestors

### Late Neolithic Technological Changes
 - Pottery manufacture is clear in the Late Neolithic
	 - Small bowls and jars are common for storage, pots for cooking
	 - Much variation in forms and decorations, all ceramics made by hand and fired in low temperatures
 - Two common decorative elements:
	 - Burnished clay producing polished surface
	 - Application of red pigment paint
 - Lithic blades disappear during this period, arrowheads become rare
	 - Sickle blades are still common, usually with serrated edges
	 - Hunting for subsistence declines, no longer need arrowheads
 - Still vaue in the concept of a Neolithic Revolution, as envisioned by Childe
 - Not a sudden shift, it was a process
	 - Began during the Natufian period with construction of small settlements
		 - Grew throughout PPNA, evidence for community planning and monumental architecture
 - Pottery, often mentioned as a hallmark of the Neolithic, only appears in the Late Neolithic in SW Asia when there was a decrease in size and density of settlements
