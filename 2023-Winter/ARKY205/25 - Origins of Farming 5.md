# First Farmers in Europe
### Origins of Farming in Europe
 - Main question: Were plants and animals locally domesticated, or was there a diffusion from SW Asia
 - Current thinking: Earliest evidence for agriculture in Europe comes from the Aegean area
 - Keep wild grasses predictable, Mesolithic people would cut down trees and partially domesticated sheep. Preconditioned them for eventual arrival of SW Asian domesticates
 - How did SW Asian domesticates arrive here? Knowledge of farming arrived with trade, some immigrating farmers, and the introduction of some domesticated plant species
 - Greece is mountainous and farmland is poor, unlikely domesticates originated here.
	 - Anatolian immigrants makes more sense
 - **Spread of Farming from Greece:
	 - V  Gordon Childe said farming diffused through Europe from a single Balkan origin
		 - Too simplistic, genetic evidence somewhat supports it
	 - Ultimately, no single model to account for this shift from foraging to farming
		 - Must be analysed and discussed in specific geographic regions
 - **Summary of Farming from Greece**:
	 - Radiocarbon dates show a clear northern + western expansion out of Greece
	 - Unlikely foragers domesticated plants independently of Anatolian farmers (most domesticates not native to Europe)
	 - Took 1200 years for farming to spread from Greece to central Europe, very gradual process

### Pottery
**Starčevo–Körös–Criș Pottery**
 - Earliest Neolithic culture out of Greece, 6200 BE
	 - Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria
	 - Unique barbotine painted pottery: Mix of clay and water applied outside of the vessels to create raised linear patterns
 - Most famous for the ceramic "Red Hair Goddess" Venus figurine (fattest ass)
**Impressed/Cardial/Cardium Pottery**
 - First in Adriatic Italy (6400 BCE), spread into Portugal
 - Named for the use of a heart-shaped shell to make a series of designs

###  Farming in Central Europe
 - Earliest central European farmers (5700-5600 BCE) may have been migrants
	 - Linear pottery: LBK, linearbandkeramik, derived from Koros culture to the east
	 - No complex late Mesolithic forager societies to develop neolithic traits
	 - Early LBK material culture is quite uniform over a wide area (not indigenously developed)

### The Linear Pottery Culture (LBK)
 - One of the most intensively studied cultures of the European Neolithic
 - Three characteristic attributes:
	 - Ornamentation style of its fine ceramics consisted of straight or curved incised lines
	 - Particular type of polished adze-axe
	 - Settlement patterns of communities of longhouses
 - Earliest farmers in central Europe are distinguished by the presence of LBK-like pottery, derived from Hungary and Lower Austria from 5550 BCE
 - LBK Sites are found on loess, whereas Mesolithic peoples preferred sandy areas
	 - Farmer and foragers were able to avoid each other

### Farming in the Early Neolithic
 - No evidence for plows during this period, Farming by digging sticks and flint sickles
	 - Limited to smaller field to remove trees, rocks, and harvest without aid
 - This farming is unpredictable, poor yields were common. Threat of starvation every year from crop failure
 - In Greece: Sheep/goats dominate, may have had ritual significance (clay figures)
	 - Cattle provided the most meat, most killed as immature individuals to cull herds
 - LBK communities settled in very specific areas: river terraces overlooking streams with thick loess soil deposits
	 - Other words: damp lowland pastures iwth light, friable upland soils
 - Built large permanent timber houses in clusters of settlements with 20-30 km between them
	 - Continuously rebuilt, people lived in same spot for several generations

### Early Neolithic LBK Subsistence
 - Assumed they practiced slash-and-burn (swidden) agriculture, forced to move periodically by soil exhaustion
 - However settlement pattern analysis, plant remain analysis, soil experiments, estimates on field sizes suggest fixed plot agriculture was most common
 - Cultivated fields within 1km of settlements based on evidence for burning
	 - Some forests cleared for cultivation, still needed nearby forest for other uses
 - **Milk and Cheese**:
	 - Early Neolithic: Period where milk consumption and cheese production are archaeologically visible
	 - Domesticated animals are easier to milk, cheese preserved for months
	 - Vessels punctured with hols found in early Neolithic deposits, thought to be associated with milk rocessing
	 - Molecular analysis on pot sherds: Anima milk fats present on some sites

### Agricultural Europe
 - 5000 BCE: Most Europeans were farmers with regions of hunter-gatherers
 - Some of these boundaries didn't shift for hundreds and thousands of years
 - Information and goods exchanged over these borders of hunter-gatherers and farmers, traded or taken after conflict?
 - Point: Evidence for farmer-forager interactions
 - Southern Germany: Mesolithic sites disappear rapidly, some likely absorbed by farming communities, some became farmers, others driven away or killed
 - Little genetic evidence for intermarriage and mixing
 - Very few early Neolithic projectile points, maibe they traded grain for game

### Early Neolithic
**Enclosures**:
 - Many types of closures all over Europe, rondels (ditched enclosures) most common
 - Debate over the purpose of these places continue, variety of functions
 - Most interpretations highlight their symbolic aspect, stood out in the landscape
	 - Some even associated with star alignments (calendars)
 - Huge investment in time and labour to make them, advanced level of sociopolitical organization
**Violence**:
 - Not much info about organized warfare, interpretation between endemic warfare and peaceful egalitarianism
 - Early Neolithic Balkans and Poland were relatively peaceful, few graves suggest violent deaths
 - LBK people were more violent. Several mass graves of violence are known
	 - Talheim: 34 people shown to be killed by axe blows to the head, settlement was raided and people massacred
	 - Other sites contain skeletons with projectile points embedded in spines and shoulders
 - Many LBK enclosures subsequently interpreted as defensive sites
	 - Warfare not intensive, violence occurred
**Burials**:
 - Status differences clearer in cemeteries based on grave goods, evidence isnt conclusive
 - Jewelry often associated with women, polished axes with men, pottery with both
	 - Gold pendents known but rare, political or spiritual leaders
 - Largest known cemetery: Wandersleben-Gotha, Thurungia: 175 inhumations, 132 cremations
**Ritual and Belief**:
 - Assume they performed ritual, magic played an important role
	 - Based on artifact characteristics, unusual features and rooms, ethnographic analogy
 - Best known debate over ritual is the ceramic figurines of women
	 - Thousands known between 6500-3500 BCE
 - Found mostly in SE Europe, almost entirely absent from central Europe and LBK sites
 - Why don't they appear on LBK sites?
	 - Possibly not preserved
	 - Maybe used pots instead of figurines
	 - Central-Europe is more war-like, perhaps lack of female figurines is reflective of warrior male ethos

### Sociopolitical Organization
 - Evidence suggest most settlements had one administrative level, could be classified as tribal
 - Evidence for such leaders is circumstantial. Some inequality
	 - Power wasn't hereditary, people followed them for charisma and success, natural leaders

### Incipient Complexity
 - No single path from early neolithic farmers to complex states and urbanization visible in the early civilizations like Egypt and Mesopotamia
