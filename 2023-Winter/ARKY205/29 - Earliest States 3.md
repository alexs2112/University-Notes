# Mesoamerica and South America
### Mesoamerica
 - Not a well-defined geographic region, place where inhabitants share cultural traits (calendars, bloodletting, games)
 - Patterns emerge in cultural zone with social/urbanizing agricultural communities
	 - Preclassic/Formative Period
 - State formation in Mesoamerica follows no one pattern
	 - Hierarchy with exclusionary strategies (single ruler at the top, Egypt or Mesopotamia)
	 - Corporate power strategies (shared across different sectors, Harappa)

### Earliest Mesoamerican State: The Olmecs
 - Emerging political complexity often first celebrated archaeologically with the Olmec sites
	 - Roots in farming communities of Tabasco (5000-4500 BCE)
 - Main Olmec sites: San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan, La Venta, Tres Zapotes
	 - Well-watered alluvial soils, similar to Nile, Indus, Yellow, Mesopotamian rivers
 - Largest later city: Monte Alban, Oaxaca Valley (50-350 BCE)
	 - Defensive wall and central court plaza used for temples and ball games
 - Emerged with an artistic tradition that included monumental human head sculptures made from volcanic rock
	 - Vivid sense of prestige in societal leaders, reverence for ball games (headgear)
 - Other artwork: Hollow clay sculptures with infant bodies and adult heads might represent divinities
	 - Series of 16 carved male figures in front of 6 polished stone axes
 - Speculation from artwork: 
	 - Town council with a balance of power?
	 - Heads of famous ball game winners, nothing to do with rulership?
	 - End of Olmec influence around 400 BCE result in people rejecting growing power of a single ruler?

### Early Maya: Case of Teotihuacan
 - End of Olmec influence on the region, massive city around year 0, reach 20 km in size with population > 80k
 - City was laid out on a single road (Avenue of the Dead) stretching for 5 km
	 - Great monuments were built (Pyramid of the Sun, Ciudedala, Temple of Feathered Serpent, Pyramid of the Moon), each associated with ritual killing
	 - At this time: Little evidence in residential construction, people lived in shanty town along main Avenue
 - Original inhabitants were a mix of different ethnic communities throughout the Mexican Highlands
	 - Natural disasters drove huge populations out of their homes, all came to this ceremonial/economic center
	 - Folk memories of this mass exodus survive up to Spanish conquest
 - Lots of debate over what kind of city this was and how it was governed, few inscriptions and lots of pictoral art
	 - No obvious rulers are depicted
	 - Self-conscious rejection of what other Mesoamerican cities were doing
	 - This was the largest center at the time
 - Before 300 CE: Warrior aristocracy ruled the city, responsible for organizing labour to build the large monuments
 - **Pyramid of the Moon**: Warrior ethos, pits around the pyramid contain evidence for military obsidian workshops
	 - Role of this pyramid was beyond symbolic, used to produce military supplies. Parallel with military and ritual?
	 - Contained burial deposits of sacrificial victims (human and animal)
 - **Destruction of Feathered Serpent Facade**: 400 CE, smashed and burned, replaced by new construction
	 - At this point: Ritual killing associated with temples appears to cease
	 - Good quality stone-built housing replaces shanty-town, visual arts celebrate community, collective values
	 - Interpretation: Teotihuacan rejected rule of military members after 300-400 CE, adopted communal rule

### Broader Mayan World
 - As Teotihuacan was growing in influence, other cities of the Classic Maya were also developing
	 - Unlike confusing political situation at Teotihuacan, classical Mayan cities had centralized kingship organized through powerful dynasties
 - Generalize evidence from Tikal and Copan: Many powerful Mayan cities founded by rulers connected to Teotihuacan
 - Still: Power was not absolute or unchallenged, late Classical period texts suggest broader aristocracy challenged kingship

### Classic Maya Collapse
 - Teotihuacan reached its zenith around 450 CE after extending influence throughout much of Mesoamerica
	 - Climate change in 535 CE may have led to droughts and ecological collapse
	 - As Teotihuacan collapsed, other Mayan centers filled the power void
 - 870 CE: Cities of the Maya lowlands collapsed, cycles of violence and warfare were escalating
	 - End of Classic period: Many of these cities were burned and abandoned
 - Series of severe droughts (short but intense) stretched agricultural support to its limits (lacked resilience)
 - Center of power in Mesoamerica moved north around the Aztec homeland
	 - Lasted until the Spanish in the early 16th century

### South American States
 - Pacific coast is a dry desert with rich marine resources, narrow arable zones along river valleys
 - Focus of research: Tawantinsuyu ("the four parts") of the Inca Empire
	 - State society in the Andes developed at two poles:
		 - One at the north coast of Peru
		 - One at the south-central Andes
	 - Only the Inca succeeded in joining these two regions
 - Agriculture remained secondary in this region when the first sedentery villages appear (2500-1800 BCE)
 - Critical change with sedentary villages: New concern with religion and the cosmos, new monumental construction
 - At least 17 different complex centers emerged around the Supe river region
	 - One of the most impressive examples: El Paraiso
 - Monumentality of El Paraiso is connected with a radical restructuring of society
	 - Major economic changes: Increase in harvesting root crops, pottery production
	 - Shift in settlements to inland valleys
 - People came together to conduct building project, channelling surplus energe and resources to a place where few people lived (congregated for ceremonies): Chavin de Huantar

### Chavin de Huantar
 - Not a massive city or core of a state, is a temple that is testimony to elaborate iconography
 - First occupied around 1500 BCE, saw expansion around 500 BCE
 - After this point: Widespread influence of Chavin-style material culture at the same time as social complexity emerges in the Andes
 - No empire, Chavin Horizon used to discuss appearance of Chavin culture on numerous sites from this period
	 - Don't know what underlies these connections
 - Lanzon: Jaguar-like human carving thought to be a deity
	 - Place of meditation with the heavens and underworld, priests transformed to jaguars and eagles
- Iconography: Jaguars, snakes, crested eagles, caymans
	- From the Amazon tropical lowlands, not the highlands of Chavin
	- Point: People of Chavin drew heavily on Amazonia imagery for their religious centers
		- This site was not built by migrants from the east, maybe charismatic leaders transferred religious beliefs?
- Artifacts emphasize transformation, found throughout highlands and coastal lowlands to the west
- Coastal site of Karwa textiles are excellent examples of Chavin art styles
	- Chavin cult rituals practiced on Peruvian coast over 500km from Chavin
	- How did the belief system spread so widely without conquest or migration
- Textiles required much skill, craft and ritual specialists must have been travelling along with religious beliefs

### The Initial Period (1800-900 BCE)
 - Prior to the spread of Chavin iconography, other groups developing towards statehood independently
 - Several kingdoms would develop on the Peruvian Coast where agricultural land was best
	 - Communication networks were established
	 - Trade routes spread technology, ideology, pottery, some architectural styles, giving impression of unity
 - People moved inland from the coast, derived most of their food from large-scale irrigation agriculture
	 - Communities grew large enough to require cooperative irrigation efforts

### Chiripa and Pukara
 - As Chavin was growing: Contemporary horizon of complex society emerged around Lake Titiaca in the south
 - Chiripia: Small village until 1000 BCE, platform mound built, modified with carved stone plaques of humans, animals (especially serpents). Many features are ancestral to later Tiwanaku architectural tradition
 - Pukara: Large residential area and ceremonial complex emerged with distinctive pottery style, not be found in later Tiwanaku culture
 - Overall trend: Initial Period onward, several small complex societies emerge with somewhat different culture, art, organization, religions. Broad similarities in cosmology united them.

### Nazca and Moche:
 - Nazca (500 BCE - 500 CE): Famous for lines and images illustrated on coastal desert floor
	 - Not sure why, astronomical, ritual procession, rain ceremonies, all argued for
	 - Cahuachi site is best known Nasca ceremonial center, many ritual objects have been recovered
 - Moche (100-800 CE): Ruled by warrior-priests depicted on pots, presided over sacrifices of war prisoners, drinking their blood and dismembering them
	 - Moche people: Farmers, fisherfolk, artisans, priests
	 - Ruler wielded authority over hierarchical state, each valley had one Moche settlement (one valley per ruler)
	 - Common argument: Moche were the first true state in this area

### Middle Horizon, Late Intermediate Period
 - 600-1000 CE: Tiwanaku and Wari states ruled in central and southern highlands. Early territorial empires
	 - Experts at mining and hammering copper
 - Middle Horizon: These two states grew large, started to integrate many smaller states into one, the two states constantly interacting with trade and war
 - North Coast: States of Sican and Chimu (700-1460 CE) are part of Late Intermediate Period
	 - Sican: Extensive irrigation systems, entered power vacuum left by decline of Moche
	 - Chimu: Overthrew Sican in 1375, famous for enormous reservoirs, creating + maintaining roadways
		 - Created infrastructure for enormous territorial empire

### Late Horizon: The Inca
 - 1476-1534: Inca empire emerged after conquering the Chimu and all surrounding states
	 - Leaders flourished in competitive environment as expert politicians and warriors
 - Cusi Inca Yupanqui transformed Inca state around 1438, developing royal ancestor cult
	 - Dead ruler mummified, court and possessions still their property, maintained by dependents
	 - Mummified ruler treated like he was still alive
 - Machi Picchu: Royal estate of these early kings
	 - Rulers started with nothing, had to conquer to accumulate their wealth, explains expansionism
 - Incan ideology was very successful: Massive army, conquered states through all South America, passion for organization. Administrative language (Khipus, strings of knots and colours) remains undeciphered

### Mesoamerica and South America Compared
 - Mesoamerica: State formation emerged suddenly with Olmec, different forms of state societies rise and fall in relation to cities
 - South America: Rather than political or economic foundations, ritual iconography of Chavin lays the groundwork for later emergence of Moche, Wari, Tiwanaku, and finally the Inca
