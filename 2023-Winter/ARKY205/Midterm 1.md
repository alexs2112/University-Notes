### Readings:
 - Lomewki 3 (2015): Pay attention to the hominin species associated with these tools
	 - Kenyanthropus Platyops, not Homo Habilis (named for its "first" tool use)
 - Oscurusciuto (2019): Know what 'Stratigraphic Unit 13' is and why it is important
	 - Stratigraphic Unit 13 of Oscurusciuto Rockshelter (Ginosa, Taranto, Southern Italy) is a short Mousterian palimpsest 
 - Early Humans in China (2010): Study the results of their paper
	 - Perhaps evolved there, did not come out of Africa
 - Sangiran, Java (2009): Review contexts that these researchers use to talk about paleoenvironments, where H. erectus lived (stratigraphically)
 - Reversal of Human Phylogeny (2020): To what models for the spread of genus Homo do they refer?
1. Earliest stone tools in genus Homo = Kenyanthropus platyops in Lomekwi 3 West Turkana Kenya
2. Stratigraphic Unit 13 = Evidence of first reoccupation of site after volcanic eruption; neanderthal settlement strategy and activities
3. Insufficient evidence (stone tools) for new conclusions about human evolution in China; must reconsider "Out of Africa" theory
4. Homo erectus forced into Java in early Pleistocene due to low sea levels and glaciers Rethinking of "Out of Africa" in genetic studies; Homo erectus left Africa and came back as Sapiens with the help of Eurasia mtDNA
5. Rethinking of "Out of Africa" in genetic studies; Homo erectus left Africa and came back as Sapiens with the help of Eurasia mtDNA

### Terminology
 - Provenance: History of an object, past roles
 - Survey: Surface of the earth, collect and identify artifacts, site boundaries
 - Excavation: Controlled stratigraphic removal of depositional layers from a site
 - Horizontal Context: Relationships between artifacts on sites, between sites on landscapes
 - Vertical Context: Encountered through excavation
 - Three-Age System: Stone -> Bronze -> Iron
 - Radiation: Wide diversity of new species evolves, each adapted to a particular ecological niche
 - Dispersal Event: Single species dramatically expands geographical range into new ecological niches
 - Symbols: Artifacts meant to represent something
 - Artwork: Incisions meant to be aesthetically pleasing

### Methods of Prehistory
 - Stratigraphic Method: Petrie, excavated sites layer by layer, collecting all artifacts from each strata
 - Relative Dating: Regions, must be double-checked through synchronisms
 - Absolute Dating: Quantitative, often relevant only for certain sites or contexts
 - Radiocarbon Dating: Only measures samples up to 50k years old, Carbon 14 has half life of 5730 years
 - Potassium Argon Dating: Potassium is abundant in earths crust, if it is sufficiently heated (volcanic) it starts to decay. Escaping gas leaves molten rock, recrystallizes and gets trapped. Volcanic material can then be analysed in a spectrometer to measure the 40Ar concentration
 - World Prehistory: Discovery of Radiocarbon Dating, Publication of World Prehistory
 - Basic methods for finding sites: Pedestrian Survey and Remote Sensing

### Interpreting Material Culture
 - Skara Brae: Neolithic settlement in Britain, looks similar to our spaces
 - Sungir Burial: Two people buried with tools, jewelry, buried in ochre, a ton of mammoth beads
 - Evolutionary Approach: 
	 - 3 Stages: Savagery, Barbarism, Civilization, cultures were identical to others in the same stage
 - Culture Historical Approach:
	 - Reliance on Archaeological Cultures with little basis in reality
	 - Plays into nationalist narratives, can be distorted
	 - Led to new excavation techniques, theoretical orientations
 - Processual Approach:
	 - Positism: Every rational assertation can be justified with scientific/mathematical proof
	 - Quantitative, tried looking for universal laws on human nature in the past
	 - Celebration of human diversity and individuality suppressed into numbers and equations
 - Postprocessual Approach:
	 - Relativism: See the past in its own terms, move away from generalization
	 - Insist there are many ways to interpret the past, the real past is unknowable
 - Mechanisms of Culture Change: Inevitable Variation (difference in learned behaviour across generations), Invention, Diffusion (trade, etc), Migration

### Stonehenge
 - Salisbury Plain, southern England
 - Description:
	 - Outer ring of vertical sarsen (local) standing stones with horizontal lintels
	 - Smaller ring of bluestones (nonlocal) inside the sarsen stone circle
	 - 5 trilithons arranged in horseshoe pattern with an altar stone in the middle
	 - Henge: Neolithic earthwork consisting of ring-shaped bank with a ditch inside
 - Legend: Stones brought from Africa to Ireland by giants, Merlin befriended them, made monument to fallen celtic nobles slain by invading saxons
 - 5 Stages:
	1. Built earthenwork enclosure, numerous wooden post structures, depositing cremation burials
	2. Built trilithon horseshoe with double bluestone circle outside, built sarsen bircle
	3. Bluestones added to trilithons, avenue built to link Stonehenge to River Avon
	4. Bluestones dismantled, rebuilt in a new arrangement
	5. Some bluestones worked into artifacts, working floor built outside enclosure, artwork applied to sarsens+trilithons, barrow cemeteries built int he surrounding landscape
 - Solar Calendar, possible purpose from stage 2
 - Landscape: Woodhenge is a monument to the living near Durington Walls, Stonehenge was a monument to the dead

### Australopithecus
 - 3 distinct genera: Kenyanthropus, Australopithecus, Paranthropus. Considered together as Australopithecus
 - East African Savannah: Drop in world temperatures -> increasingly open environments -> benefit ground species
 - East African Rift Valley: Massive trough began separating 22-25 mya, excellent for finding sites
 - Olduvai Gorge: Most important site for human evolution, small lake eventually filled with sediments, then eroded
 - Paranthropus: Robust Australopithecus due to massive molars, face muscles that aided in chewing (nutcracker man)
 - Lucy: Most famous (Hadar, Ethiopia). Pelvis nearly identical to modern humans, walked upright, proved brain size and bipedal locomotion did not evolve together
 - Laetoli, Tanzania: Shows Pliocene hominins were habitually walking upright (no knuckles), fully bipedal before big human brains
 - Dikika Child: Toddler nicknamed Selam, very good at walking bipedally (intact left foot) and climbing
 - Leaving the Trees: Travelling open country is hard, full of predators, high quality plant foods widely dispersed

### Emergence of Homo, Stone Tools
 - Episodic glacials of gradual cooling (stadials, cool) and periods of quicker warming interglacials (interstadials, warm)
 - Homo Habilis: Earliest species assigned genus homo, first identified and Olduvai Gorge, much diversity, toolmaker
 - Homo Erectus: Most successful human species, slimmer, taller, bigger brain than H Habilis, lower paleolithic
 - Lomekwian: Oldest stone tools found in Lomekwi 3, Kenya
 - Oldowan: Olduvai Gorge Beds, simple core (crushing) and flake style (slicing) of tools, low effort, carried around
 - Acheulean: characterized by biface flaking on both sides, skillfully crafted with symmetry, sharp edges

### African Exodus
 - End of hominin radiation, Australopithecus variants all extinct, only Homo erectus remained
 - Ubeidiya: Likely first stop out of Africa, freshwater lake with similar animals, stone tools look like late Oldowan
 - Dmanisi, Georgia: Oldest hominin site outside Africa. Elderly individual lost all but one tooth, cared for by the others.
 - Paleomagnetic Dating: Earth's geomagnetic field switches polarity, chronology of these switches relate to sediments, some periods are enormous
 - Bose, China: Earliest Acheulian industry discovered outside Africa
 - Geshor Benot Ya'akov, Israel: Next earliest dated site, Hominins here used fire to cook nuts
 - Boxgrove, England: One of the best known Acheulian sites in Europe, handaxes become much better made
 - Zhoukoudian Caves, China: Peking Man fossil, Massive site, earliest confirmed evidence for fire due to dark caves (contentious)
 - H. heidelbergensis to refer to H. erectus after 500 kya in Europe, Africa
 - Spears: H. erectus, maybe H. neanderthalensis, making spears to hunt as early as 500 kya (evidence from Schoningen, Germany and Kathu Pan, South Africa)
 - Pit of Bones: Atapuerca, over 4k bone fragments, huge variation in skeletal characteristics, disposal of bodies

### Neanderthals
 - Skeletal remains show lots of variability in H. erectus populations (ergaster, antecessor, heidelbergensis), by 250 kya these hominins evolve into Neanderthals in Europe, Denisovans in Asia, archaic Homo Sapiens in Africa
 - Denisovans: Genetically distinct from Neanderthals, H. Sapiens. Common ancestor with humans, Neanderthals, all evolved out of H. heidelbergensis
	 - All had different teeth, suggests physical differences with very little physical evidence of Denisovans
 - Artistic Depictions: hairy, stooped, dim-witted, violent. No longer have these opinions
 - Oldest clear Neanderthal fossil from Biache-Sant-Vasst (France)
 - Most recent Neanderthals in Spain, Mezmaiskaya Cave (Russia)
 - Glacial Cycles: Surficial evidence of scouring of valleys due to glacial advance + retreat, can't date periods based on this alone (older events may be distorted)
	 - Other evidence is stratigraphy, alternation of soil, loess deposits
	 - Best to use deep sea record, higher ratio of oxygen isotope ratio in shellfish when it is colder, consistent results worldwide
 - Mousterian Industry: Most common stone tools from Middle Paleolithic, flake tools from prepared-cores
	 - Debate about diversity in stone tools, Neanderthals had very small handaxes
 - Francois Bordes: Claimed 5 different types of toolkits, interpreted as different social groups, tribes, ethnicities. Wrong, are functional groups
 - Frison Effect: Over lifetime of use, stone tools constantly get resharpened and become smaller
 - Disc-Shaped Cores: Easier variety or prepared-cores, flakes struck off cores radially, as this is done the core becomes a flat disc
 - Levallois Technique: More complex, take a single sharp thin flake to then make additional tools out of it
 - La Borde, France: Thousands of fragmented bones, most were from aurochs (wild cattle)
	 - Sinkhole repeatedly used by small groups of Neanderthals at different times of the year, drove cattle into it and killed them from above, also short-term camp, no evidence for food storage but would provide ton of meat (sharing)
 - Middle Paleolithic Subsistence: Diverse economies of animals, several habitats at once, could produce fire for cooking
 - Hunting: Both solitary and collective, seasonality to it that changes over the year, animals butchered on site, meat carried back to camps to cook in hearths (little evidence for food storage)
 - Scavenging: Played a role, hunting main contributor, specifically carnivorous. Would expect diversity of species, lots of very old+very young animals, lots of bones from parts with little meat
 - Isotope Analysis: Can detect if food had chemical signature, relative frequencies of isotopes changes between plants, animals
	 - Adult teeth mineralize at 13, oxygen isotope of local water is recorded in teeth, tell if buried individuals moved around
 - Cannibalism occurred: Moula-Guercy cave, France, Human bones bearing cut marks and breaks similar to deer bones
 - Settlement: Highly mobile, lacked complex social structures, settlements to access multiple habitats, changed w/ climate
 - Society: Series of base camps characterized by sharing, small isolated groups (10-20 pop), no evidence of status or ritual

### Homo Sapiens
 - Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH), very low genetic variation w/ big brain
	 - Jebel Irhoud, Morocco: Earliest H. sapiens fossils
 - African Middle Stone Age Industries: Some similar to Mousterian tools (Levallois), most Acheulean. Much regional variation
 - First Bone Tools: Kantanda, Congo, barbed projectile points likely hafted onto spears, bone awls to make clothes
 - Middle Stone Age Subsistence: Like Neanderthals, but with lots of shellfish and seal bones (marine resources). Also plants
 - Blombos Cave, South Africa: Earliest evidence of hominins marking a pattern in the world, ochre decorated with incised lines
