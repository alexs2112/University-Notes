### Mycenaean Arms and Armor
 - Included heavy bronze panoply (plate armor) with boar-tusk helmets
	 - Short swords worn likely by officers
	 - Common soliders used long spears, heavy bronze plated wooden shields
 - Best archaeological example comes from village Dendra in Argolid
 - Panoply almost certainly used for ceremonial purposes, maybe 1v1 combat
	 - LH IIIC: Warriors depicted on Warrior Vase have leather corlets and fringed leather apron, more mobile

### Palatial Period of LH IIIA-B
 - AKA Third Palace Period
 - Late phase of LH period witnesses full political, military, social power of Mycenaean city states after destruction of Knossos in 14th century BCE
 - Mycenaean civilization grew rapidly
	 - Expansion of military control over Aegean led to period of relative peace, economic flourishing
 - Institutionalization of power best represented in three main forms of material culture:
	 - Architecture of Mycenaean palaces
	 - New burial practices in the form of tholos tombs
	 - Spread of new language and script, Linear B

### Mycenaean LH III Palaces
 - Strong cultural continuity with the MH period
	 - Main examples: Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos, Thebes
 - Share common attributes with Minoan palaces, administrative and ceremonial centers which undertook craft production and food storage
 - Unlike Minoan palaces, seats of powerful individuals or dynasties
	 - Kings, possible queens
 - Architecturally, center of Minoan palaces were open-air courts, center of Mycenaean palaces was the megaron
	 - Long hall fronted by open portico, interior vestibule, then a throne room with 4 olumns and central circular hearth with an oculus above
	 - Visible focus of the space was the throne
	 - Paths into the megaron were complex and indirect, possible routes for ritual processions
 - Many of these palace structures were occupied for centuries prior to Mycenaean domination
	 - Megarons likely modified from open-air Minoan-style courts
 - Attribute of 13th century BCE (LH IIIB): Expansion of settlement defenses by developing hilltop settlements into true citadels with walls and gates
	 - Evidence that many Mycenaean settlements were under sporadic attack by unknown enemies
	 - Accompanied better roads, drainage, water supplies, along with expanding rural population, land exploitation, specialized labour

### Mycenaean LH III Graves
 - Most common people buried in rock-cut chamber tombs during LH period
 - Few tholos tombs constructed in LH III outside mycenae
	 - Likely the result of their rulers, retructuring right to monumental tombs for elites at select palatial centers
 - Mycenae, Treasure of Atreas tomb (Tomb of Agamemnon) built 1250 BCE (LH IIIBI)
	 - No evidence either Atreus or Agamemnon buried here

### Linear B
 - Bulk of examples come from unfired clay tablets that were burned and preserved by destruction of Knossos and Pyos
 - Unlike Linear A, Linear B has been translated thanks to Alice Kober, Emmett Bennett, Michael Ventris
	 - Ventris notices tablets from Pylos and Crete had matching symbol groups, suggested palace names
	 - Worked out enough of the texts to realize that the underlying language was a form of ancient Greek
 - Adapted from Linear A to write down early form of Mycenaean Greek
	 - Administrative language used exclusively at palaces, primarily to keep track of accounting, social organization through land management
 - Describe administrative system with wanax (king) ruling over administrators who manage the political economy of the palace
 - Land was the most important resource, landowners required to pay taxes to the palaces in agricultural surplus
 - Palace used this wealth to establish trade relationships with other centers around the Aegean, importing raw materials, exporting specialized craft products like oils, textiles, wine, pottery

### End of Mycenaean Palaces
 - Signs of trouble in late 13th century BCE (LH IIIBII) shortly after Knossos
	 - Political, economic control by palaces becomes stronger while a few instances of palace destruction, decline occurs
	 - Social system appears strained
 - By end of next period, Mycenae and Tiryns are in states of active decline, Pylos and Thebes are fully destroyed
 - Complex administration described in Linear B tablets appears gone

### Postpalatial Period of LH IIIC
 - 12th to 11th centuries BCE (LH IIIC) are postpalatial
	 - All palaces are destroyed, most regions of landscape are abandoned
	 - Linear B, luxury crafts, frescos all disappear over the course of several decades
 - Social instability, organizational collapse appears all over the landscape
	 - Some sites, Tiryns, Mycenae, reoccupied after their destruction but on a much reduced scale
 - Burial evidence suggests massive depopulation in many regions
 - 11th century BCE, little that appears Mycenaean, homogeneity of Palatial period is gone
	 - Regional and local preferences emerge all over Aegean in the period known as Submycenaean

### What Collapsed Mycenaean Civilization
 - Internal Warfare and Invasion:
	 - Internal dynastic struggles, archaeology does not confirm any one city state is victorious, unlikely a civil war would destroy every palace without exception
	 - Another theory, widespread invasion by Dorian Greeks, widespread destruction and spread of language (Doric)
		 - Problem: no good evidence, later Greek societies develop out of Mycenaean society, not an invading force
 - Fall of the Hittites and Sea Peoples
	 - Other civilization collapsed due to northern invasion
	 - Same time, group of Sea Peoples began raiding New Kingdom Egypt along the southeastern Mediterrannean
 - Likely: Disruption in eastern Mediterranean coincided with internal strife in the Aegean, also likely earlier climatic trigger for economic downturn, migration of people
 - Network of power collapsed, food production plummeted, populations decreased
 - Some cities fought each other, others destroyed from within
 - Palace model became anachronistic, served no purpose by the end of this period

### Sybmycenaean Athens
 - By Submycenaean, Aegean society was significantly simpler than it was during LH IIIA-B, but not all
 - Athens experiences continuity from Mycenaean to Submycenaean, into modern times
 - Some believe the exceptional social longevity of Athens and its resistance to foreign invasions begins with survival through submycenaean period

### Final Bronze Age in Italy: Proto-Villanovans
 - Last phase of Apennine culture is also called the Proto-Villanovan period (1200-900 BCE), pottery designs foreshadowed Iron Age Villanovan culture
	 - From 1200 BCE, numbers of sites sharply increase, population increase
 - As Terramere Culture was in decline, growing influence in Italy from the Central European Urnfield CUlture (1300-750 BCE)
	 - Protovillanovan is a branch of Urnfield Culture
 - Protovillanovans continued to settle on defensible hilltops, practice agro-pastoralism, cremated their dead like Terramare people
	 - Difference was use of Urnfield biconal urn for burial

### Villanovans
 - Cremation became widespread in Italy throughout final Bronze Age until inhumation regained population in Southern Italy
 - Between 1200-900 BCE, different parts of Italy began to develop stronger regional variations
 - 900 BCE, region of modern Tuscany underwent significant transformation associated with introduction of iron working into Italy
	 - Led to emergence of Iron Age Villanovans, later the Etruscans
	 - Emergence of "Italian Peoples"

### No Italian Late (Recent) Bronze Age Collapse?
 - Second half of RBA, nearby Aegean Civilization, Hittite Empire ended
	 - Large-scale societal collapse had little apparent impact on iItaly besides cutting off trade relations with eastern Mediterranean
	 - Contact with central Europe continued unabated
 - No collapse, perhaps Italian society of small scale agriculturalists and sheep herders were more resiliant, comparatively simpler older agrarian economy
	 - Simpler society isn't necessarily more resilient, consider Terramare
	 - Rare for society to collapse into nothing
	 - Most cases, societies that collapse become simpler and populations shrink quickly
 - Answer: Levels of socioeconomic complexity of Mycenaeans and Hittites could not withstand barrage of shocks and stressors
	 - Including environmental change, human migration
	 - No evidence that Italian society was subject to the same shocks and stressors, continued largely unaffected

### Sardinians and the Bronze Age Collapse
 - Italians were involved in the Late Bronze Age Collapse in the eastern Mediterranean
 - One factor was likely migration of peoples alongside endemic piracy
	 - Commonly combined into theory of Sea Peoples
 - Only surviving contemporary account of these peoples come from Egypt
	 - Ramses III defeated coalition of migrants at Nile Delta attempting to enter Egypt
	 - To celebrate, commissioned a wall carving illustrating his victory
	 - Sea Peoples were warriors, also brought families looking for a new place to live
 - Medinet Habu Temple carving shows warriors in helmets that look like those found on bronze sculptures found in Bronze Age Sardinian burials
	 - Sherden or Shardana, both part of the Sea Peoples as migrants
		 - Also served as mercenaries for North African and Near Eastern states, like Egyptions
	 - Some scholars claim these are Sardinians, heavily debated
