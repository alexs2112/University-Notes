### Greek Dark Ages
 - Ferdinand Braudel: Longue Duree (long, slow, environment changes) -> Conjonctures (medium, cyclical rhythms rise and fall) -> Evenements (lives of individuals and events)
 - Dark Age: Lack of writing, dark spot in chronologies, cyclicity of rise and fall of empires
 - Regeneration: Few societies collapse completely, followed by long regeneration phase
 - Iron: Spread from Hittite empire, more plentiful than copper and tin but harder to extract (smelted, purified, reworked)
 - EIA Society: Administrative centers gone, literacy disappears for 4 centuries, knowledge from burials + grave goods
 - Post Mycenae: Palaces destroyed, many towns and villages disappear, independent regions organized by oikoi
	 - Basileus: Chieftains of these small groups
 - Northern Greece: Less connected to Mycenaean, doesn't suffer as badly, rule through kingship (bronze age trajectory)

### Geometric Period
 - **Protogeometric**: Iron technology arrives in Greece, likely from Cyprus, around 1050 BCE
	 - Paints of horizontal decorative bands, compass-drawn circles on shoulders of vessels, amphorae are common
 - **Early Geometric**: Prolonged phase of dislocation of social complexity in the southern Aegean after Bronze Age Collapse
	 - Designs are far more intricate, circles are minimized in focus, mostly covered in black glaze and grew in size
 - **Middle Geometric**: Society best described as small competing cheifdoms, large settlements progressively absorbing smaller ones
	 - Decorative zones multiply, also black glaze, some with illustrated horses+water birds, rarely people
 - **Late Geometric**: Burst of social complexity, 750 BCE, population increase, economic expansion, growing wealth, new alphabet
	 - Geometric designs maintained, figural art more regular, geometric designs on secondary zones and pictoral scenes become the focus
	 - Amphorae, Kraters become enormous, some as grave markers
 - **EIA Burial**: Men buried in neck-handled amphorae, women in belly-handled forms
	 - Not so inclusive, only for privileged male elites (besides the Rich Athenian Lady), population decline but not super dramatic
 - **Bronze Tripods**: Cooking and warming food for communal eating/feasting, large and ornamented gifts and rewards
 - **EIA Architecture**: No monumental stone building, family homes of one room curvilinear houses
	 - **Lefkandi Heroon**: Long building of stone and mud brick, plastered smooth interior
	 - Central room of two pits, north pit contained four horse skeletons, south pit of a female buried with tons of jewelry and a bronze krater of the cremated remains of a man
 - **Lefkandi Centaur**: Most recognizable artifact, found in Toumba tomb 3 (Lefkandi), return to figurative art
 - **EIA Society**: 1/2 of population buried (agathoi class, the good) including basileus class and yeoman farmers (hoplite class)
	 - Remaining population was subservient peasant class (kakoi class, the bad)
	 - Late Geometric pottery shows male leaders armed with swords and spears, kept peasantry under control with force
 - **End of Dark Ages**
	 - **Settlement**: Curvilinear houses replaced by rectangular houses with stone foundations, tighten into communities
	 - **Economic Recovery**: Increasingly rich grave goods, temples of rich votive offerings, trade, iron improved
	 - **Social Evolution**: Elite factions wanted traditional hierarchies, middle faction wanted more democracy
		 - Tensions in burial practices, investments in art
	 - **First Alphabet**: Very versatile, used by several eastern Mediterranean societies, Ancient Greek, Phoenician script with vowels

### Archaic Greece
 - Orientalizing by connections with Near Easy and Egypt, adoption of alphabet, trade, myths, art, most active was Corinth
 - **Proto-Corinthian Pottery**: Images derived from Near East -> Plants, Animals, Monsters, no women with lots of violence
 - **Black-Figure Pottery**: Artists known by autographs, illustrate on raw clay, painted in black, backgrounds then picked out revealing ceramic underneath. Most continued animal and plan tthemes, until Athens developed narrative themes
 - **Kouroi and Korai**: Figurative depictions include full human forms, some big sculptures, naked male youth and clothed maidens
 - **Archaic Society**: Political, intellectual battle between aristocracy and civic society, basileis yield to assemblies and citizens
	 - Aristocrats hold power as judges and politicians, maintain status of heroic warriors
 - **Archaic Burial**: Social tensions, cemeteries moved outside towns, wealth existed and adopted new status displays
 - **Evolution of the Polis**: Unlikely to have ethnic foundations, patchwork of settlements in EIA that recrystallize to polis
 - **Archaic City**: Asty developed out of EIA clusters of houses/hamlets, buildup of private+public sectors, agora, all defended by wall
 - **Hoplite Reform**: Middle class derived from elites, massed ranks of foot soldiers, return to large armies operating in phalanx
	 - Challenges traditional power of EIA basileis
 - **Urban Sanctuary**: Temples as integrative roles in communities, growth of public conspicuous consumption, laws inscribed
	 - Monumental temples emerge, differentiated by their colummns: **Doric, Ionic, Corinthian**
 - **Extramural Sanctuaries**: Symbolic incorporation of poleis assimilating surrounding villages. political sacred processions
	 - Eleusis: Secret initiations for the cult of Demeter and Persephone
 - **Panhellenic Sanctuaries**: Open for all Greeks, theaters for display between elites, city-state competition rituals
 - **Agora**: Equally important Archaic development, open-air assembly in main square of polis, political participation

### Magna Graecia
 - Early Iron Age Italy, alongside Archaic period in Greece, Greek colonization of Southern Italy, Villanovan starts in Northern Italy
 - Colonies were independent city-states, brought Greek institutions to less complex societies and created network of long trading
 - Competing basileis, heroic dynasties, make their mark abroad by expeditions into new territories
 - Magna Graecia: small colonies in southern Italy, first is Pithecusa, island of Ischia
	 - Longevity due to good locations for trade and shipping and large agricultural hinterlands for farming
	 - Provide Italians with models and concepts to change economic,social development of Italy

### Villanovans
 - In Etruria and the Po region, very rich land, good for trading, farming, iron and copper ores
 - Influence switched between Urnfield culture to Halstatt Culture (continued using Urnfield burials)
 - Men and Women are more equal, both being buried with weapons, armor, weaving, domestic tools
 - **Metalwork**: Horses were important, many horse fittings and artistic representations, metal objects far more common
 - **Burial**: Biconal urns, hand-made without potters wheel, impasto ware, thick-walled burnished pottery
	 - Impasto: Dough/mixture, course bodied pottery, impure clay with fairly high silica or mica (sparkly) content
 - **Hut Urns**: Biconal urns eventually replaced by these, depict aspects of domestic architecture, look like little huts, can be detailed
 - **Houses**: Oval-shaped house foundations, small terracotta figures lining roof
 - **Settlement**: Became wealthy, increasing population, developed on defendable plateaus, some hilltop settlements, agricultural
	 - **Tarquina**, Cerveteri, Veii, Vulci
 - Grave assemblages begin to show very rich items after contact with Greece and Phoenicians

### Etruscans
 - Dominant based on economic advantage, no centralized government, evolution of Villanovan society
 - Consumers of imported luxuries, eventually producing pottery and metalwork (masters at pouring bronze)
 - Tomb Paintings: General social equality between genders (public lives of women), origin of roman things (togas, pre-gladiator)
 - Eastern Influences: 
	 - Villages coalescing into towns: specialization of labour + crafts
	 - Rise of urban society + social classes: aristocratic families, adoption of writing
	 - Arrival of Greeks: sculpture, monumental architecture, increase pottery production, aristocratic consumption of imports
	 - Increase in aristocratic status and power, decrease in social fluidity: Greek artisans & merchants confined to sites, rise of urban demos (people below aristocratic class)
 - **Pottery**: Refined Villanovan look with Bucchero ware: Black, thin-walled pottery on wheel (resemble bronze)
	 - **Noble Bastard**: One side has Odysseus blinding cyclpos, other of Etruscan naval battle
		 - Aristonothes: Best Bastard, son of Greek aristocrat in Etruria
 - **Settlement**: Cities out of Villanovan villages (Tarquiniua, Cerveteri, Veii, Vulci), operate in city-state model
 - **Tarquinia**: First true Etruscan city, mineral resources, largest known temple (Ara Della Regina) and Necropolis of Monterozzi
 - **Gravisca**: Trading center for Tarquinia, huts around Aphrodite shrine, successive building phases of shrine represent growth
 - **Architecture**: More complex than Villanovan due to Greek/Phoenician influence, cities of high political/social organization
	 - Highly organized houses, series of interconnected rooms and private courtyard, Atrium (entrance hall, collect rainwater)
 - **Temples**: Polytheistic religion, grave goods -> afterlife, augury and haruspicy (natural omens, organs of sacrificed animals)
 - **Banditaccia Necropolis**: Incosistent burial practices, built on city-like plan, thousands of graves with Etruscan art
	 - Three types of tomb: Monumental tumuli, Cube tombs, Underground chambers (most spectacular is Tomb of the Reliefs)
	 - Sarcophagus of the Spouses: 4 separate pieces, figures depicted in Etruscan fashion w/ hairstyle and footwear
 - **Decline**: Rival economic interests, Cumae was important economically, lost fight for it along w/ commercial supremecy

### Greco-Persian Wars
 - **Battle of Marathon**: Athenians and Plataeans joined forces and defeated King Darius I, effective phalanx
	 - Greek dead cremated and interred on site, placed in two separate tumuli (odd as out of style)
	 - Commemorative victory column raised
 - **Battle of Thermopylae**: Spartans sent small force to hold passage into Boeotia, betrayed and killed by King Xerxes
	 - Environmental archaeology, modern Malian Gulf shallower than during this battle, soil cores to collect plant material, then radiocarbon dated to map how the shoreline shifted
 - **Sack of Athens**: Themistocles evacuated Athenians to island of Salamis and abandoned Athens
	 - German excavation, layer of destruction debris as Pererschutt (Persian Rubble)
	 - Lots of sculptures (major discovery for art history), some decapitated
 - **Battle of Salamis**: Themistocles tricked Xerxes into sailing down narrow straights of salamis, fully defeated them in cramped area
	 - Underwater archaeological research suggest stretch of laid stone is base of port structure
	 - Port structure adjacent to Polyandreion of Salamis: Mass grave tomb where trap was sprung, victory monument nearby
 - **Battle of Plataea**: After Salamis, united Greek army commanded by Sparta marched to Plataea to confront Persian army, tricked them into attacking divided, definitive victory
	 - Persian weapons melted down to create bronze column of three entwined snakes, golden tripod
	 - Column remained until Ottoman occupation, eventually turned into fountain, Mehmed Conquerer smashed it to demonstrate strength, 1700s was toppled and all that remains is base and one serpent head
 - Aftermath: Sense of ethnic unity, Athens began to rebuild along with The Long Walls (alarming the Spartans, degrading relations)

### Classical Greece
 - Central and Southern Aegean: Poleis dominated settlement hierarchies, supported by extensive agricultural hinterland (chora)
 - Northern Aegean: Ethnos (tribal states), political control based on ethne, power resided in single elite or king
 - **Landscape Survey**: Walking over landscapes to find artifacts, can be redone as fields are ploughed and reploughed to reveal sites
 - **Delian League**: Lead by Athens, extracting tribute for protection, plus rich agriculture, silver mines, olive oil, very rich
	 - Grew to control surrounding settlements, self-sufficient, produced surplus to send to Athens
 - **Attic Landscape**: Divided into 3 zones, each zone had 10 trittyes, each tribye (phylai) had 1 trittye of each zone (non-contiguous)
	 - Zones: Asty (urban), Mesogeia (inland), Paralia (coast)
 - **Key Landscape Studies**:
	 - **Atene Survey**: Area near Athens support rich landowners involved in olives
	 - **Kea Project**: Island survey, much of the landscape might be destroyed
	 - **Pylos and Laconia Surveys**: Vast area controlled by Sparta mostly inhabited by helot-serfs with limited rights
		 - Spartan citizens owned rural estates while serfs farmed them
	 - **Boeotia Survey**: Dense population may be accurate if peasants supplemented income, otherwise lands insufficient for family
	 - Pottery evidence is most important, majority of Classical pottery is domestic course wares (not fine red-figure pottery)
 - **Peloponnesian Wars**: Sparta vs Athens, plague hit Athens, Spartans invaded yearly to destroy towns and burn crops to destroy economy, Athens only protected by Long Walls, Sparta built a navy to block Athenian supply lines forcing a surrender
 - **Plague of Athens**: Killed 1/4 of population, extremely contagious, bodies piled ons treets with mass graves (throwing bodies into pit particularly uncommon for Greeks), DNA analysis suggests typhoid fever (possible salmonella contamination)
 - **Sculpture**: Rare to find in context, most are actual Roman copies, most did not survive (wood), meant to be painted
 - **Red-Figure Pottery**: Similar to black-figure, black gloss left on backgrounds with red clay subjects, details in third colour
	 - Allowed more individualistic styles, clear distinctions between different potters
 - **White-Ground Ware**: Pottery covered in white slip of kaolinite (fine white clay) and painted, looks more expensive (like ivory)
	 - Much less durable, used primarily as votive or in burials
 - Ceramic painting provides glimpse into lives of domestic women; higher classes confined to house, otherwise working fields
 - **Monumental Architecture**: Only change from Archaic -> larger with more flourish, theaters more common, drama emerged
 - **Burial**: Decrease in lavishness as reflection of polis ethos -> condemn ostentation by the rich -> sculpted stone markers (stelae)
	 - Grave Stelae: As many female as male figured gravestones, twice as many with both together, growth of middle class and balance in genders, most famous of Hegeso, Karameikos cemetery in Athens
	 - Group tombs disappear entirely, people buried individually (interred, Athens only cremated)
 - **Urban Life**: Men expected to frequent public spaces, women managed work+household+budget
 - **Domestic Architecture**: Oikos enclosed as private unite, widely comparable house sizes and designs across most poleis
	 - Central open courtyard the focus, surrounded by rooms in rectangular structure
	 - Middle/Upper classes, men and women had seperate spaces
		 - Women -> Gynaikonitis/Gynaeceum: locked from outside, more mobile decor, assumed mostly in top floors of houses
		 - Men -> Andronitis/Andron: Formal drinking parties to entertain male guests
	 - Outside of poleis, peasant mudbrick houses still common, no separations of spaces, most two rooms with small yard

### Readings:
 - Lantzas 2016: pay attention to how she studies postcollapse in the Argolid.
	 - Period ignored due to a lack of writing, figural art and monumental architecture  
	 - Focused on geographical perspectives: built environments, mortuaries, ceramic material, and metal objects to show the development of ideologies, social and economic practices
	 - Studies site abandonment, use, decrease/increase in sites, architecture built and the uses
	 - Mortuary Contexts: mortuary practices are integral in creating and reinforcing social relations 
		 - Shift from the importance of the collective to the individual: increase in individual burials , decrease in chamber tombs
	 - Mycenaean palatial centre collapse gives an opportunity for new ideologies and social organization
	 - Sites of palatial centers remained as a focal point of activity instead of using a single location for ritual and socioeconomic practices, many locations in the early iron age served these functions
	 - Ceramic Material and Metal Objects shows the production and consumption patterns stayed the same
		 - Suggests that production was already being done domestically
		 - Continuity in shapes and sizes of both ceramics and metal objects suggest that production was already being done outside the palatial region and their frequency in burials indicates that the people were not as poor as once thought
 - Liston and Papadopoulos 2004: review the condition in which the Rich Athenian Lady was discovered.
	 - The bones were handled with care when collected from the cremation pyre & much more of the skull survived than usual 
	 - Her unusual wealth may have been due to her dying while pregnant or during childbirth rather than her tomb representing vast wealth (indicated by fetal bones)
 - Lang 2002: pay attention to the approach adopted and why architecture studies are useful. 
	 - Problem 1: Excavating houses in one go doesnt consider multiple occupation phases and changes in house plan, later building houses can make the structure differ completely and we wouldn't know the original purposes
	 - Problem 2: Few settlements are excavated in their entirety, the few houses that are aren't necessarily indicative of them all
	 - Old Approach: Digging Classical would usually stop before Archaic, digging Pre-Archaic would usually destroy Archaic strata
	 - Need to also keep track of the material culture and inventory instead of just the floor plan of the structure
 - Neil 2016: focus on periodization.
	 - Etruria underwent dynamic changes, emergence in highly stratified landscape on emergent urban centers
	 - Many new forms of material culture used to illustrate evolving social + political relationships
 - Cunha 2004: compare and contrast the causes of the Athenian Plague.
	 - Bubonic Plague: Few features consistent with Thucydides description, missing parts he should not have missed writing down. Has extra things that bubonic plague does not have. Also an absence of black rats, prerequisite for bubonic plague
	 - Typhoid Fever: Death by Typhoid Fever usually occur later than the victims of Athens were dying, also less lethal than it would need to be to kill so many in a short period of time
	 - Epidemic Typhus: Typically lacks problems in upper respiratory system and fever, also needs black rats. Has many of the same features, more likely than typhoid or bubonic, but not enough characteristics to make it the cause
	 - Smallpox: Many varieties and has many of the same symptoms as the Athenian plague. Should not have the rash that the Athenians did, lack of pox otherwise mentioned previously makes it also unlikely (but more likely than the others)
	 - Measles: Lack of sores and blisters, lack of diarrhea and extremity gangrene
