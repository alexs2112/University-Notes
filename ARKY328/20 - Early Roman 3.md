# Artifacts, Economy, Architecture
### Classes of Roman Material Culture
 - Artifact types used to date sites in Italy:
	 - Fine ware pottery (tablewares)
	 - Coarse ware pottery (cooking, storage, shipping amphorae)
	 - Lamps (lighting)
	 - Coins (trade and sale)
 - Another common attribute: Architecture

### Roman Pottery: Black-Gloss
 - Fine ware pottery indicative of Roman occupation
 - By late 4th century, black-gloss is found at nearly every Roman colony and allied Italian site
 - First manufactured in great numbers in Naples, by 3rd century BCE it was produced all over Italy and in Greece, exported widely (especially to Marseille and Carthage)
 - Forms vary widely
 - Variety of colour profiles:
	 - Campana A (Campania): red clay, black gloss
	 - Campana B (Etruria): beige clay, bluish-black gloss
	 - Campana C (Sicily): gray clay, black gloss
	 - Campana D (Ventimiglia): imitation of B

### Indigenous Italian Pottery
 - Black-gloss didn't displace all pottery styles
 - Greek pottery styles (and imitations) are found at most medium to large scale sites and towns
 - In Samnium, coarse impasto wares with some imported Campanian bucchero wares
 - In Daunia, pottery mostly hand-formed despite the potters wheel
 - **Daunian Pottery**:
	 - Characteristically light coloured with various red, brown, black painted designs
	 - Designs are mostly geometric until 5th century BCE, curvilinear with crude human, plant, birds
	 - Forms become more standardized 350-250 BCE, the askos, now Hellenized, becomes popular into the first century BCE (looks like a teapot)
 - **Messapian Pottery**:
	 - From Salento region, mid 7th century BCE with geometric Greek inspired patterns
	 - Early 5th century, figurative representations appear (influence by Athenian red-figure)
	 - Preferred forms include the *olla* (long curved handles), pitchers, *trozzella* (long straight handles with ball joints)
	 - In 4th century BCE, geometric designs return inspired by Gnathia ware
 - **Gnathian Ware**:
	 - Production in 370 BCE to compete with Attic red-figure
	 - Rather than picking out the black paint, Gnathian ware had colour painting applied directly to the black glaze
	 - Themes included scenes of women, theater scenes, Greek influenced meanders
	 - Around 330 BCE, white paint dominated and motifs were limited to plant tendrils with heads or birds painted within them
	 - Shipped outside Italy throughout the Mediterranean, even to the Black Sea

### Constraints of the Evidence
 - So far
	 - Studies of pottery can trace spread of Roman culture, indigenous elite identities, and the process of urbanization throughout the peninsula
	 - Excavation can recover pottery while telling us about the types of buildings and their functions
	 - Ancient text can tell us about political and military history
 - Sources of this period don't really discuss the economy
 - Archaeological evidence needs to be interpreted to understand economic concerns

### Italian Settlement (500-200 BCE)
 - Historical perspective: Defection of Roman allies for Carthage after the Roman loss at Cannae in 216 BCE indicate they were developing independently
 - RPC Project: Archaeology of these communities show this was true before, during, after Rome
 - Small farms in south Italian country increase significantly from 400-200 BCE
	 - Agricultural surplus appropriated by nearby urban elites
	 - Instead of using for private ostentation (burials and palaces) we see huge increase in public monumentalization
 - Urban aristocracies were using their wealth to increase the glory of their cities for their citizens
	 - Euergetism

### The Early Republican Villa
 - First true villas were symbols of Roman rural domination and economic exploitation
 - Appear in central Italy by 300 BCE
 - In this context: Large farm complexes
 - Would be transformational to the Roman countryside in 2nd century BCE, remain central until 6th century CE
 - **Rural Architecture**:
	 - 6th Century BCE: Very simple, non-rectilinear dry stone foundations with wattle and daub walls
	 - Methodological issue: Excavation of these small sites is rare
 - **Poggio Civitate**:
	 - Murlo, Tuscany
	 - Likely the largest building on the peninsula at the end of the 6th century
	 - Set important architectural precedents of scale and quality

### The Mid Republican Villa
 - As Rome begins its hegemonic expansion throughout Italy, opportunities for new rural villas
 - Proliferation of small farms and early villas from 300-150 BCE
	 - Few functional differences
 - Many structures show evidence of household industries, wine + olive oil, wool production

### Roman Slavery and the Economy
 - Rise of ancient slavery corresponds with the growth of the villas
 - Slave society since 4th century BCE, likely from Samnite wars
 - Very little direct archaeological evidence for slavery in this period
	 - Exceptions include iron shackles found occasionally
	 - Literary sources say slavery was pervasive
 - Most common: Slaves taken during war, people could sell themselves/children to escape debt
 - Legitimate legal status that had significant impact on the economy

### Amphora
 - Grain doesnt survive archaeologically in a significant amount
 - Telling of Roman economic growth: Study of containers that shipped agricultural products
 - In 5th-4th centuries BCE, most amphoras found at archaeological sites on land and sea are MGS (Magna Graecia-Sicilia) amphoras (slightly shorter and fatter)
 - New type of amphora in 4th century: Greco-Italic types (Campania, Latium, Etruria)
	 - Quickly replace MGS type
	 - Italy's economic core moves from the south to the center of the peninsula

### Rich Getting Richer
 - Economic trend from 266-200 BCE: Italy suddenly withdraws from significant interregional exchange networks and production on the peninsula splits into smaller regions and intensifies
	 - Pottery manufacturers in Latium and Campania begin signing vessels with maker marks, describing families, origins, specialties
	 - Southern Italy, production of bricks and tiles (opus doliare) was always publically administered. Over 3rd century BCE, productions are privatized, according to brick and tile stamps
	 - In south, transhumance (seasonally moving herds around landscape, relying on communal grazing lands) also privatizes during this period
 - Driven originally by First Punic War, richest landowners were becoming increasingly wealthy

### Early Republican Domestic Architecture
- Better known from late Republican and early Imperial periods
- Roman house: The domus
	- Excavations on Palatine hill show houses built in late 6th century BCE, plot sizes roughly equal
	- Cross shaped interiors in Greek styles, maybe gendered divisions of space
	- In 3rd century BCE, aristocratic houses become larger and more opulent
- Vitruvius: Roman domus was designed to be opposite of Greek oikos by social role
	- Houses should reflect status and dignity of its owner, designed to facilitate public display
	- Not an urban retreat, constantly hosting outsiders
- **Role of the Domus**:
	- House of the middle-upper classes
	- Roman senators were expected to maintain duel roles as private paterfamilias and public magistrate in the same structure
	- History was important, elites used their houses to display current and past successes
	- Two important social traditions: Salutatio and Convivium. Every morning the atrium of the elite was open to the public so that clients could present themselves to their patrons. In the evening honored clients and guests were entertained with food, drink, conversation
- Through these rituals, elite familia justify their place in society

### Layout of the Atrium House
 - Excavated House of Diana (at Cosa) built at the end of 200 BCE is instructive
 - A. Entrance, steep corridor with fauces and benches, flanked by independent tabernae (C, D) rented out as shops
 - B. Atrium, where salutatio occurred, where family trophies were displayed. Central impluvium pool collected water from the compluvium in the roof (also provided sunlight)
 - Recesses Din the atrium (H, I) were used for storage
 - J: Tablinum, most symbolic room. Early republic: Master bedroom. Late Republic: Family records
 - The cubiculae (E, F, G) werer multiuse rooms, bedrooms
 - Convivium occurred in the triclinium (K)
 - M: Corridor allowing access to the hortus (garden) at the back
 - L: Bathroom and kitchen space, common to combine (even with bathtubs)
 - N, S: Likely represent a bathhouse

### Mid Republican Architectural Decor
 - House walls would have been made of stone, covered with stucco that was painted a variety of color
 - Pre-dates the Pompeian Styles of wall painting (200 BCE - 79 CE), likely more modestly decorated but shared some of the stylistic themes
 - Wall painting was an accessible form of decoration, illusion that houses were of grander scale and importance
 - Archaeologically: Frescos normall found as small fragments in deposits of collapsed architecture. Unable to reconstruct images, usually plain white or painted a solid colour
 - Few Republican period artifacts survive in most Roman urban settings
	 - Houses built in prestigious places, later demolished to build enormous palatial houses in the imperial period (political reorientation of the city)
 - Construction of imperial palaces sometimes preserved aspects of Republican structures
	 - Domitian's Palace used Republican houses as part of its foundation and subfloor infill

### Other House Types
 - Not all houses were elaborate. Some middle-class houses continued simple cross-style corridor house (four rooms flanking central open space)
	 - These smaller houses value privacy over the larger atrium houses
 - Evidence for multiple families occupying the same dwelling spaces
 - Urban housing blocks: insulae
	 - Large wooden apartment complexes, cheap and easy rent from urban lower classes
 - Slave quarters were more comfortable than the free poor, who lived on the streets

### Roman Construction Techniques
 - Famous for their concrete, invented 250 BCE, only widely used from 150 BCE
 - House foundations made from local stone, roughly dressed into rectangles
	 - Better dressed stone for wall segments (opus quadratum style)
 - Early to mid Republican floors were beaten earth in rural and lower class settings, middling to aristocratic Romans had solid floors designed with simple black or white mosaics
	 - opus sectile
	 - Style made from red or black marble segments cemented to create colourful surfaces

### Economy Summary
- By 200 BCE, Rome + allies had free population of around 3m (similar number of slaves), Rome itself had about 1m
- Economy was privatizing due to growing wealth of richest landowners
- Craft production and exchange flourished (pottery), large-scale export trade was small compared to the next period
- After Second Punic War, Hannibal's Legacy in Italy was the start of a fast imperial-style economic and interregional territorial expansion
- Late Republic was the true start of the Roman Empire
