### Overview of Early Iron Age Italy
|Period| |Time|
|---|---|---|
|**Villanovan Period**|Villanovan I|900-800 BCE|
|(900-720 BCE)|Villanovan II|800-720 BCE|
|**Orientalizing Period**|Early Orientalizing|720-680 BCE|
|(720-580 BCE)|Middle Orientalizing|680-625 BCE|
| |Late Orientalizing|625-580 BCE|
 - Broadly referred to as the Early Iron Age, occurs alongside Archaic period in Greecce
 - Begins with Greek colonization of southern Italy, interacctions with Bronze Age populations
 - Villanovan culture developing in northern Italy
 - Villanovans become influenced by Greeks, foundation of the Etruscans

### Archaic Aegean
 - Proliferation of city-states and artistic culture, greatest flourishing in Classical period
 - Key sites: Athens, Corinth, Argos, Sparta, Boeotian federation, some Cyclades
	 - Core regions, created wave effect influencing socio-economic growth in Crete, western + northern Aegean
 - Unlikely economic contacts with the east were central to Archaic period growth
 - Opening up of the Aegean as internal and external dynamic
	 - Internal: Orientalising cultural styles in southern Greece
	 - External: Greek expansion as market and entrepeneurs (770-750 BCE, late Geometric)

### Colonizing the Archaic Mediterranean
 - Established colonies were independent city-states bound to their mother cities by shared heritage only
 - Brought Greek institutions to less complex societies, broadened economic basis of the Mediterranean by creating network of long-distance trading
 - Original idea: Desire for resource, manpower, trade, agriculture
	 - Problem: Greek colonies don't recognize dependence on their mother city, established to be autonomous
 - Current idea: Competing basileis, heroic dynasties, make their mark abroad by expeditions into new territories
	 - Learned of them thanks to the Phoenicians
	 - Could also be fueld by conflict at home, seek out followers and leave their home territory
	 - Economic decision instigated by political economy

### Magna Graecia
 - Small exploratory colonies in southern Italy
	 - First colony: Pithecusa, island of Ischia, quickly integrated with native Italians
 - Name "Italy" first enters historic record at this time, specific to the south. Calf-land
 - Two reasons for colony longevity:
	 - Good locations for trade and shipping
	 - Large agricultural hinterlands for farming
 - Process of colonization in southern Italy
 - Poseidonia (Paestum): Greek colony established before 600 BCE as successful trading center
	 - Conquered by Lucanians around 400 BCE, then Romans in 273 BCE
 - Economy would be transformative for Rome
 - Agricultural, commercial, defensive Greek sites would provide Italians with models, concepts, techniques that changed the economic and social development of Italy
	 - Greeks responsible for providing Italy (Rome) with potter's wheel, olive oil, large-scale cereal cultivation
	 - Also provided large-scale ports, writing, coinage, in addition to artistic, intellectual pursuits
	 - One group transformed by this: The Villanovans

### The Villanovans
 - Earliest phase of Etruscan society
 - Controlled much of Etruria and the Po region between 900-750 BCE, very rich land
	 - Perfectly positioned at the top of the Tyrrhenian Sea, network of complex trade relationships developed
	 - Rich volcanic soils (andisols)
	 - Plentiful amount of iron and copper ores
 - Continued to cremate their dead and use biconal urns (inhumation in the rest of Italy after FBA)
 - Influence switched from Urnfield culture to the Hallstatt Culture, unclear how these affected them
	 - Urnfield burials, Hallstatt material culture (sgraffito ceramic decoration)
 - Men and women appear to have more equal societal standing, both genders being buried with weapons, armor, or weaving paraphernalia and domestic tools
 - **Metalwork:**
	 - Horses were particularly important, bronze and iron horse fittings found, horse representations in art
	 - Metal objects become far more common
 - **Burial:**
	 - Biconal urns, still hand-made as they don't have potters wheel until Villanovan II
	 - Made of impasto ware, thick-walled black burnished pottery
	 - Often in sgraffito decorative style, formed and coated with thick black paint before being burnished and incised with geometric lines revealing the ceramic body under the paint
 - **Impasto:**
	 - Italian word for dough or mixture, coarse bodied prehistoric pottery
	 - Made of impure clay with fairly high silica or mica (sparkly) content
 - **Hut Urns:**
	 - Biconal urns eventually replaced by hut-shaped burial urns in Villanovan II
	 - Incredibly valuable archaeologically, depict aspects of domestic architecture that is otherwise lost
	 - Often made in simple terracotta ceramic, can be extremely detailed
 - **Houses:**
	 - Oval-shaped house foundations, reconstructions with mud brick or wattle and daub walls with wooden thatched roof
	 - Evidence for small terracotta figurines lining the roof
	 - Nucleation of these huts are the first phase of urbanization that would characterize the Etruscans
 - **Settlement:**
	 - Became very wealthy, increasing population, social stratification, urbanization
	 - Developed on defendable plateaus,most famous being **Tarquinia**, Cerveteri, Veii, Vulci
	 - Hilltop settlements also developed, with smaller hamlets and farms sprinkled between
	 - Society was predominantly agricultural, Etruria yields were 3x higher than neighbouring Latium

### Villanovan II
 - 800-720 BCE
 - Significant economic changes as northern Italy comes into contact with Greek civilization (Euboeans)
	 - Also Phoenicians, trade increased along Amber Road connecting Italy with trade route north to Baltic Sea
 - Grave assemblages start to show very rich items, glass and amber necklaces, bronze armor + strap fittings, development of inhuman burials alongside cremation
	 - Greek pottery and local imitations of it also increasingly appear
