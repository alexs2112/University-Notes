### The Disunited Subject
 - Split of "History" and "Archaeology", importance of each varies between countries
 - Unification must be distinguished from subordination of one discipline to another

### What is Archaeology
 - Modern definition is the exclusive investigation of material culture (open to debate), should not exclude written and oral sources
 - Courbin 1988: The establishment of facts is the archaeologist's proper role and mission
	 - If the archaeologists looks into history or anthropology, ceases to act as an archaeologist
	 - Draws a boundary without giving a reason why (along with a circular argument)

### Relationship Between Archaeology, History, Sociology, etc
 - Overlap between history and archaeology is total, same questions with different evidence
 - Social Science vs History: Nothing, social scientists are more concerned of abstract and general theories about social life but still rely on historical interpretations (Giddens, 1984)

### Dangers of the One-Sided Approach
 - With only artifaccts, but no knowledge of culture, would come to absurd interpretations of the material evidence
 - Cannot look at archaeological and historical evidence independent of each other
	 - Always unconsciously influenced by past knowledge
 - Sometimes history has missing parts, archaeological remains fill those in
 - Results of fieldwork are of fundamental historical importance, only recognized when put into wider context

### Risks of Necessity: Specialization
 - Chapter argues against blindly following rigid definitions of disciplines created in the past, specialization is still important
	 - Would have no importance if everybody was totally specialized in narrow things
	 - Significance only once the info is linked with other fields

### Emancipation of Archaeology
 - Is archaeological evidence of the same importance as textual evidence
	 - Yes
