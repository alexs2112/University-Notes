### Middle Bronze Age Overview
1. This period sees the recovery of Aegean communication networks after the EBA III crisis.  
2. Response to the EBA III crisis was varied over our three Aegean regions.  
3. Minoan civilization coalesces during this period and begins to affect the wider Aegean.  
4. The MBA III periods are often equated with LBA IA periods, especially for Crete.  
5. The period ends around the time of the Theran eruption on Santorini.

### Middle Helladic Culture Sequence
|Period|Time|
|---|---|
|MH I|c. 2000-1900 BCE|
|MH II| c.1900-1700 BCE|
|MH III| c.1700-1600 BCE|
 - Lasted approximately 400 years
 - High and low dating that differs by about 100 years
 - Much geographic variation during the MH period

### Landscape After EH III
 - EBA III crisis affected the mainland more than Aegean islands:
	 - Depopulation
	 - Destruction of sites
	 - Changes to settlement pattern, hierachy
	 - Changes to mortuary practices, material culture
 - Old explanation: Invasion, migration
 - New explanation: Localized environmental change leading to land degradation and erosion, affecting agricultural, social systems

### MH Settlement Pattern
 - Most small rural EH sites abandoned by MH I, size of remaining settlements decreased (minus Argos, Thebes, Mycenae)
	 - World of villages
 - Signs of recovery in MH II, process is geographically uneven
 - By MH III, real developments are evident:
	 - Number of sites increase, land use becomes more intensive
	 - Areas abandoned from EH III, MH II are reoccupied
	 - Argos, Thebes, Mycenae expanded in size
	 - Three tiered site hierarchy becomes visible once more (different housing sizes)
 - Stark contrast to Crete, sees true population explosion in MBA

### MH Domestic Architecture
 - Aside from the site of Malthi (Messenia), few settlements from this period have been excavated
 - Few settlements appear fortified (only Kolonna on Aegina)
	 - Many circuit enclosure walls at other mainland sites have uncertain construction dates, likely postdate the MH period
	 - Houses appear homogenous, irregularly placed over MH I - II, often stone foundations with mudbrick walls
		 - Many houses have kitchen areas with large storage jars (pithoi) for bulk storage of grains or liquids
 - Settlement organization appears to become more regular, organized, socially differentiated
	 - Houses in MH III become socially differentiated: at Asine some MH III houses can be 4x larger thn other houses
		 - Parts of more regular plans, sometimes on sides of pathways

### MH I-II Burial
 - Mortuary practices are broadly similar across EH III to MH II
 - Burials are intramural (within settlements), interments ocurring below house floors, cut into house ruins
 - Extramural cemeteries are more in use from MH II on
 - Tumuli and tholoi are used, sporadically
 - Simple pits, cists are still used. More pithoi or small jar burials (infants)
 - Most graves for single individuals, some communal graves
 - Grave goods, simple: Vases, Beads, Bone Pins, etc
	 - Exceptions: Tumuli in Aphidna, Kastroulia, Kolonna

### MH I-II Social Organization
 - Communities organized in villages, life around agriculture and livestock
 - Basic craft activites were domestic
 - Common people buried in chamber tombs (rock-cut, simple tholoi)
 - Elite culture returns to Greek mainland as early as late MH I, MH II
	 - Some slightly richer burials
 - Burials are organized in kin groups and residences, not in individual status (wealth isn't super important here)
	 - These burials appear relatively poor compared to EBA, LBA burials
	 - When authority is based in kin relations, less incentive to practice conspicuous consumption of material culture
 - This changed in MH III with the first shaft burials
	 - Cordoned off cemetery area, build a huge deep shaft (12m)
	 - At the very bottom of the shaft, put a box containing the corpse and a bunch of riches
	 - Shaft refilled with dirt, stone slab to mark the area

### MH III Burial
 - Dramatic changes from MH III - LH I
 - Extramural cemeteries are more popular
 - Secondary treatment of the body is more common (bury once, wait for fleshy parts to come off, rebury the bones)
 - New tomb types: Shaft graves, chamber tombs
 - Grave goods increase in opulence, conspicuous consumption in burial contexts is the main strategy for creating power and prestige in MH period

### MH Material Culture
 - Pottery: simple and conservative, differences between regions and neighbouring sites
 - Tools and ornaments remain simple, two exceptions:
	 - Arsenic bronze becoming replaced by tin bronze
	 - Nearly all well-made ceramics are now done on a wheel
 - Popular styles become standardized and 'minoanized' in MH III

### MH Exchange Networks
 - Trade relationships broken in EH III were not completely mended in MH I, some developments
	 - Eastern coast trading with Aegean islands and Crete, on small scales
 - Aeginetian pottery distribution provides a clue about the breadth of these connections, pottery exports
 - Metal like copper and lead were imported from the Cyclades
 - Minoan influence becomes visible in mainland during MH III, sherds of Aegean made pottery can be found as far away as Adriatic Italy

### What Happened in MH III
 - Burial archaeology suggests social organization was more complex than previously assumed, leading families displaying significant wealth
 - Were these changes due to steadily increasing wealth?
	 - Not likely, true economic takeoff for the region occurs after the shift to shaft graves
	 - Most likely: large centers like Kolonna, ARgos, Pylos, Mycenae were increasingly integrated into economic networks of Aegean world
		 - Competing leaders at home were manipulating these contacts to increase their own wealth, social status

### Foundation of the Mycenaeans
 - Kin group benefited in wealth from political ambitions by opportunistic leaders
 - These leaders would become Mycenaean rulers, early growth of Mycenaean state
 - Minoan civilization in Crete was creating new arenas of social action, diplomatic alliances in the MBA, main political contacts

### Middle Cycladic Culture Sequence
|Period|Time|
|---|---|
|MC I|c. 2000-1900 BCE|
|MC II| c.1900-1700 BCE|
|MC III| c.1700-1600 BCE|
 - Approximately 400 years, same as the MH period
 - Distinctive from the other Aegean islands
 - Defined mainly by pottery classes, pictoral designs
 - Settlements are still small compared to Crete and the mainland
 - Only the island of Thera, Minoan influence (not control), exhibited the same population density as Crete

### Settlement in the MC Period
 - Continued centralization of settlement on some islands, similar to Crete, without immense wealth and wide-scale trade relations
 - Most sites are large townships, little evidence for small rural sites aside from few islands
	 - Fortification continues during MC
 - Phylakopi on Melos, most important site in the Cyclades for establishing a regional understanding during MC
	 - After First City was destroyed in EC III, Second City (now fortified) helped characterise MC pottery (3 phases)
 - Demonstrated the same regional cultural assemblages as the EC period, more novel Minoan artifacts and styles

### Settlement Sizes
 - Psychology theory, suggests human groups maintaining pops of 150-200 people creates a situation of relative social stability, most interactions are face to face (Dunbar's Number, contentious)
 - If there is available land, f2f societies that get too large will fission, one group will move to a new settlement to avoid social conflicts
 - Still requires communities to share resources, exogamy to prevent inbreeding
 - Once populations grow over 500 or more, social inequality becomes apparent
	 - Towns develop, conflict is inevitable
	 - Rise of corporate self-interest
	 - Genetic trading, less of a problem. More endogamous, start to protect their holdings to ward off external attack
 - Some archaeologists theorize occurring on the Cyclades: 
	 - Population centers remained around 150-200 during EC, relatively peaceful
	 - After EC III, Kastri and PHylakopi were fortifying, true towns (city-states?) of several hundred people were developing
	 - In the MC: Typically one fortified settlement on each island

### MC I - II Pottery
 - MC I pottery characterised the second phase of Second CIty at Phylakopi, period IV at Ayia Irini
	 - Wares include Dark Burnished, Cycladic White
	 - Dark Burnished was more important in MC I, range of shapes, usually reds, browns, blacks
	 - Cycladic White was present in EC III contexts, continued in use after Dark Burnished
 - MC Cycladic White is almost always decorated with early Curvilinear patterns, MM pottery
	 - Dubbed the Minoanization of Aegean material culture and societies
	 - Unlikely Minoans directly controlled the Cyclades, influence was predominately technological with a culture of socialization

### MBA Boats
 - According to Broodbank 2000: boats with sails appear on Cretan seals from EM III-MM IA
	 - Likely used regularly at this time in the Aegean
 - Ships replace oared longboats of the kind depicted on EBA frying pans
 - Presence in the Aegean revolutionized trade, increasing shipment size and speed
 - Technology originated in the eastern Mediterranean, diffusing to west

### Takeaways
 - Period of centralization, wealth accumulation
 - Trade relationships continue to expand within and beyond Aegean
 - Growing influence from Crete extending throughout the Aegean during the MBA
 - Work is showing each site needs to have its own internal chronologies, large regional-scale schemes hide complexity but are necessary with older work
