|---|---|
|EM I|c. 3100-2700 BCE|

|EM II B| c. 2400-2200 BCE|
|EM III| c. 2200-2000 BCE|

### EM Settlement, Urbanism
 - End of Neolithic, three types of settlements in Crete:
	 - Agricultural sites in productive hinterlands
	 - Trading sites on the coast
	 - Marginal sites
 - By EM II, most marginal sites were abandoned except those in wider exchange networks
 - Agricultural sites were growing (as in other EBA II regions)
	 - Settlements begin to look like early cities (proto-urbanism)
 - Growth of proto-urban sites continued into EM III, associated with agricultural intensification and extensification
	 - Supported by more complex social hierarchies, privileged access to prestige goods
	 - Coastal sites (Malia, Palaikastro) benefit more than inland sites (Knossos, Phaistos)

### Proto Palatial Central Places
 - MM courts (open spaces within palaces) are built over Neolithic or EM open spaces
 - Many courts used for large-scale communal rituals (feasting)
	 - Key part of communal rites was commensality (eating + drinking together)
	 - EM I pottery consied of large vessels, suggests household groups eat and drink from the same bowls
	 - By EM IIA, vessel forms shrink (footed goblet), become widespread, evidence for hierarchical differences between ceramic, stone, metal vessels
 - Suggests social hierarchies are becoming more complex, transcending household groups

### EM Production and Exchange
 - In Final Neolithic, ceramic production was a low-level household specialization
	 - Localized, geared towards community needs
 - In EM I, new and more complicated, regionally-specific burnished, slipped, painted ceramic wares
	 - Start of independent fulltime specialists, distinctive products for local, external market
 - Prestige items (stone, metal) were becoming restricted to prominent sites
 - Rise in copper production sites highlights the intensification in metal production at the end of EM I
 - Petrological analysis: ceramic vessels exchanged locally, likely as gifts between elites
 - Coastal sites were large centers of exchange in EM, smaller coastal sites were procuring and working obsidian, metal, stone
	 - Procurement intensified in late EM I into EM IIA, cycladic peoples may have moved to Ayia Photia, Poros on the north coast
 - From EM IIB at Knossos and Poros: Cycladic imports disappear, remain rare in EM III, their raw materials (obsidian and copper) remain. Suggests shift in Cretan-Cycladic trading
 - Egyptian and Syrian imports are present in EM II and III in small numbers (mostly burial contexts)
	 - Preference for elite culture shifting from Aegean to Eastern Mediterranean models
	 - Unlikely a concerted effort by eastern powers, more likely a long-term diffusion from merchants, craftworkers

### EM Society: Burial
 - Late Neolithic, EM I, most Cretans had access to visible forms of burial near habitation sites
	 - Early examples of caves, into EM I round vaulted tombs (tholoi) and cemeteries
	 - By EM II we see house tombs
 - New forms of burial reflect increasing social competition
	 - New ways to mark status, use ritual to appropriate ownership of places in the landscape
	 - Keep digging up old skeletons to reuse the tomb for someone else, not much respect for the dead
 - EM I, find conspicuous consumption (purchased for burial) in lavish grave goods
	 - Bronze daggers, gold jewelry, amulets, beads, etc
	 - These were status items worn on the body
 - EM II, grave goods also included terms for body maintenance like obsidian blades for shaving and bronze tweezers
 - Materials highlight social competition and identity diversification
	 - Some invisible lower classes may not have been buried at all

### EM Society: Writing
 - Minoan seals and sealings in EM II, emergence of elite identities and cultures
 - Practice of sealing lumps of clay with seal stones (like written script) came into Crete from the east
	 - Unlike the east, Cretan seals were not likely used for centralized administrative  purposes and likely were used to tag the seller or producer of goods or property
 - No good evidence for writing in the EM

### Conceptualizing the EM Period
 - Did not result from eastern invasions, not a sudden and new cultural beginning
 - Not a period of social equality
 - EM society consisted of individual households subordinate to the interests of the community
 - Over EM, households appear to become subordinate to specific households who claim responsibility of the whole community
	 - Elites of socioeconomic development
	 - In EM III, certain households were developing elite identities
 - EM households were competing for status

### Middle Minoan Culture Sequence
|Time|Period|Palace|
|---|---|---|
|MM IA (c. 2000-1900 BCE)|Late Prepalatial Period|First/Old Palace|
|MM IB (c. 1900-1800 BCE)|Protopalatial Period|^|
|MM II (c. 1800-1700 BCE)|^|Second/New Palace|
|MM III (c. 1700-1600 BCE)|Neopalatial Period|^|
 - Crete sees quick recovery after the EBA III crisis
 - True palaces appear to emerge in the MM IB period, slightly earlier
 - Sequence is based on pottery styles, not architectural phases (don't line up perfectly)
 - MM III, often equated with LM IA
 - Neopalatial period continues into the LM

### First/Old Palace Period (MM I-II)
 - Best examples from Knossos, Malia, Phaistos, Petras
 - MM I period, increasing settlement densities immediately after EM III crisis
 - Farming and pastoralism are local, focused on broad mixed economies
	 - Villagers produced surplus for intervillage exchange
 - Palaces were places of communal ritual, no societal control
 - People may not have lived in palaces full-time until LM IB

### King Minos
 - King of Crete, son of Zeus, Europa
	 - Wife gave birth to the Minotaur
	 - Minos was a violent, cruel tyrant
 - Bull iconography is popular in Minoan Crete, may be linked to rite of passage (youths leaping over bulls)

### Legacy of Knossos
 - Sir Arthur Evans: Excavated Knossos from 1900-1904
 - Gave Cretan civilization the name Minoan, based on Minos

### Protopalaces
 - Monumental architectural structures: central court surrounded by a variety of rooms, set within larger urban settlements
 - Renfrews interpretation: Palaces were residences of political, religious, economic authority.
	 - Ruled countryside, collected and stored agricultural surplus
	 - Increasingly refuted, based on better-known LM occupations of these structures
 - Early MM palaces have evidence for activities, at Knossos:
	 - Textile production in Loomwight Basement
	 - Agricultural commodity transactions according to hieroglyphs of grain, figs, olives
	 - MM IIA Royal Pottery Stores, stacks of plain drinking wares, extremely fine pottery imported from Mesara, Pediada
	 - MM IB Vat Room, plaster lines pit filled with drinking vessels, obsidian debitage, high alue items
 - Appear to be consumers of high quality material culture rather than producers
 - Buildings outside of the palace are excavated in different quartiers
 - Palaces appear to be decentred towns, nearby affluent houses conducting affairs just like the palace, on smaller scale
 - In MM I-II: Every palace served a different series of functions related to its surrounding community
	 - Court-complexes rather than palaces
	 - May not have had residents full time
	 - Ritual centers and storage facilities (to facilitate rituals and communal feasting)

### MM Material Culture
 - Dominated by Kamares pottery (MM IA, LM IA)
	 - Extremely thin due to diffusion of fast potters wheel
 - Designs are predominantly polychromatic, more than one colour, typically black, dark grey with designs in white, blue, red, orange, yellow
 - Vessel forms are vvarious
 - Designs include abstract flowers, curvilinear marine motifs

### Writing in the MM 
 - Cretan hieroglyphs in MM IA, IB
	 - Phaistos Disc, contentious, may be a forgery
 - Most famous is Linear A, presumed syllabic cript
	 - Linear: cut with a stylus rather than stamped like cuneiform
	 - Remains undeciphered
	 - Inscriptions come from dozens of sites on Crete, a few sites on the Aegean islands and southern mainland

### Revising Early MM Society
 - MM I First/Old palaces were engaging in production, consumption, storage, distribution
	 - Did not control the economies, politics of their territories
 - No evidence that palaces were residence of a single centralized authority
 - Court Complexes, producing textiles, high-quality prestige
 - Biggest distinction: court complexes consumed a lot of food and drink (huge quantities of pottery, communal space size)
	 - Venues for social display by the richest Cretans, not necessarily those who singularly controlled all aspects of Cretan society

### End of the First Palaces
 - Sometime around c. 1700 BCE, first palacesa re destroyed
	 - Knossos: Palacec walls collapse, great fire
	 - Malia: collapse of the Old Palace and town
	 - Phaistos: Palace destroyed, not rebuilt
 - Cause: Possibly nearby volcanic eruption, more likely to be a series of earthquakes
 - Almost every major site is rebuilt by c. 1650 BCE, ushering in MM III/LM IA phase
