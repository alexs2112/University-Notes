# Macedonian Greece

### Hellenistic Greece Overview
 - Period of transitions, begins with fallout of the division of Alexander the Great's empire and ends with the early Roman annexation of Greece
 - The Hellenistic period covers 300 years of history, much conflict on the Greek mainland after 150 BCE thanks to the arrival of Rome

### Alexander the Great
 - In his short time as king (336-323 BCE, 13 years) Alexander:
	 - Defeated uprising in Thebes, stopped all threat of Greek rebellion to his rule after Philips death
	 - Crossed the Hellespont, defeated Achaemenid Persian empire as retribution for their attacks in the 490s BCE
	 - Conquered Egypt, took Babylonia, marched as far as India, in only 7 years
	 - Founded (or refounded) over 30 cities, giving many the name Alexandria
	 - Adopted policy of allowing conquered subjects to continue their social and cultural practices alongside Greek technological, economic, philosophical advancements
 - Success was swift and empire was ephemeral (2 years), his impact would be felt in much of central Eurasia for centuries
 - Many subsequent rulers would attempt to emulate Alexander's character and success
 - **Fallout of his Death**:
	 - Military feats resulted in spread of Greek (Macedonian) culture throughout eastern Mediterranean and beyond. First stage in Hellenization
	 - Empire would only last for 2 years (325-323 BCE), would start to erode immediately after unexpected death
	 - No succession plan, only one young son, generals carved up his empire in the following decades to create their own political dynasties
	 - Result was that the Aegean outside the state of Macedon was a marginal zone to the wider (quickly Hellenizing) east
		 - This new, larger Greek world (koine) was tied together with common language, pottery forms, coins, domestic practices, architecture
		 - Importantly: Upper classes benefited most in this period

### Hellenization
 - Spread and adoption of Greek ideas, material culture styles, people, across the western Mediterranean world and east into the lands that were conquered by Alexander the Great
 - Hellenization took on number of different forms, general points to remember:
	 - Spread of people and ideas, including deities and concepts of worship, during the 4th century BCE. Led to a noticable population decrease in Greece
	 - More generally the spread of Greek culture before, during, after Alexander. Greek colonies in Southern Italy count as an aspect of Hellenization
	 - Not a single event. Process of social, cultural evolution based on aspects of Greek culture with different regional varieties. Besides Alexander's foreign policies, not necessarily deliberate
	 - Popularized Greek language, literature, science, philosophy well beyond the Aegean
	 - Often used to describe the style of idealized, calm, perfected figural sculpture, painting, mosaic. Romans would find particularly appealing, copied for much of later Republic and Imperial periods

### Greece in the Early Third Century BCE
 - Southern mainland Greeks revolted after Alexander's death
 - Macedonians came south to regain order, eliminated democratic constitutions while sponsoring oligarchies or monarchies
 - City states survived as local cities with few foreign affairs
	 - Different leagues attempted to counter the Macedonians, none managed to break away fully

### How did the Macedonians Hold Greece
 - Macedonians rarely figured in the histories of Archaic and Classical Greece, northern Aegean remained land of small scale kingdoms and chiefdom societies
 - Philip II changed this (in part due to political imprisonment in Thebes), built up enough wealth, support, experience to challenge southern Greece when their conflicts at the end of Classical weakened them
	 - Philips victories brought southern Aegean more peace than the preceding 150 years
 - Macedon was a superpower
	 - Incorporated regional elites into their royal courts
	 - Had professional army more complex and deadly than traditional phalanx
	 - Enough food and minerals to dwarf any resistance from the divided southern Aegean
 - Remained strong thanks to influx of wealth from Alexander's eastern conquests

### Developments in the Hellenistic Landscape
 - Early landscape maintained same trends visible from the Classical period:
	 - Family farm and farm clusters dotted the landscape
	 - Populations remained high
	 - Rural landscape settlement was dense
 - Main difference between Classical and Hellenistic:
	 - Wealth concentrated significantly in the north around Macedon, instead of the south with Athens, Thebes, Sparta
	 - Otherwise largely similar
 - Rural contexts:
	 - Most pottery is from social dining contexts rather than transport (few amphoras)
	 - Suggests economy of the countryside was not directed to commercial food production
 - All changes with arrival of Rome, landscape archaeology demonstrates negativity of ancient sources

### Hellenistic Cities
 - Most Greek cities occupied in the Classical era continued into the Hellenistic period with some minor modifications
 - New forms of personalized monumentality promoting a ruler, new city walls in light of new forms of siege warfare used by the Romans
 - Some cities built from scatch, new capital built at Pella in western Macedon, other new cities populated by forced migrations (Demetrias in North-Central Greece)
 - Overall: historic luck accounted for dynamic fortunes of Hellenistic cities. If a city was particularly liked by a Hellenistic ruler it was promoted, funds spent to enrich it. If a city was disliked it was ignored or actively disadvantaged by promoting its neighbours
 - The way for a city to gain popularity and wealth was through advertising the wealth of powerful benefactors
 - The kings who succeeded Alexander favoured Oligarchy over Classical Democracy
	 - Result: Political autonomy of city states was largely ended
 - Classical cities built monuments by paying for them from the city coffers
	 - Rich gained public support by partly funding festivals, public structures, or military ventures
 - When wealthy kings took over, new power politics emerged
	 - Cities not attempted to win favour of aristocrats or kings by promising support
	 - If successful, these patrons would finance all new urban features
	 - Stoa of Attalos built by King Attalos to honour Athens for providing his education
 - Common Hellenistic urban developments include arch gateways, colonnaded avenues called stoae. Most famous is the Stoa of Attalos in Athens
	 - Used mostly as commercial facilities
 - Another common structure inner-city gymnasia. Usually at edges of Classical cities
	 - In Hellenistic, wealthy couldn't participate directly in politics, spent time cultivating traditional civic values in athletic pursuits and promoting body-culture
	 - These gymnasia replaced older agora as the focus of elite male culture

### Commerce in Hellenistic Cities
 - Wealth of Hellenistic kings helped urban commerce flourish
 - Elite barred from politics, new interest in commerce began
 - Businesses began to emerge in urban spaces, some appearing in old agora grounds that were largely unused
 - Unlike Classical period: Foreigners could gain citizenship and own land in previously-closed polis communities
 - Also see large commerial complexes constructed during this period. 
	 - Island of Delos, massive excavated complex was built in Hellenistic for shippers from Berytus (Beirut) with warehouses, offices, production spaces, living quarters, and a shrine.

### Urban Life in Hellenistic Cities
 - Reorienting around powerful families, idea of wealth creation was most important social responsibility
	 - Wider economic relations meant women had larger role in family affairs beyond the household
 - Wealthy landowners spending money on public infrastructure and events
	 - Women help distribute this wealth, honorary inscriptions thanking women for donations
 - Result of class restructuring, rich having too much money without enough people to spend it
 - Development would shift social norms away from disrespecting womens public potential from Classical
 - Epigraphy: Study of inscriptions made in stony, shared between Archaeology and History

### Hellenistic Houses
 - End of Classical: Polis concept of non-ostentatious private housing started to relax
	 - Became acceptable to flaunt status
 - Changing attitude accentuated by oligarchic Macedonian rulers. Differentiation in house size and decoration increased
 - Houses became places for public display of wealth and status.
	 - Entry was display opportunity
	 - Differences in size became obvious, spaces for entertainment and socializing grew
	 - Rooms for family functions and services shrank
		 - Also suggests relaxed attitude to female seclusion

### The Vergina-Aigai Royal Palace
 - One of the earliest, most spectacular example of changing attitude toward domestic space
 - Palace built by Philip II at his first capital of the Macedonian Kingdom
 - Monumental east facade with giant court, surrounded by numerous meeting rooms and banquet halls with mosaic floors, permanent couches for lounging and dining
 - West side of court held private apartments, the place where Philip was assassinated
	 - His tomb, along with Alexander IV, is also on site
 - Succeeding Macedon capital of Pella had similarly sized palaces, used primarily for entertaining and feasting
	 - Gymnasia took on role of supporting male elite culture
	 - Palaces replaced agora as venue for political life
 - Rich urban houses emulate these palaces

### Hellenistic Economy
 - Classical poleis typically made and used their own food and materials
	 - Commerce of minor importance to most city states (minus Athens)
 - Commerce becomes more important in Hellenistic period due to 2 major factors:
	 - Citizens redirecting energy away from polis affairs towards growing personal wealth
		 - Society more concerned with wealth display than the Classical period
		 - Early capitalist forms of economics
	 - Scale of dynastic kingdoms after Alexander
		 - All active in Aegean, opened up more space for cultural, social, economic exchange
		 - Motor for this new exchange was wealth of Persian empire, newly distributed to Alexander and his successors
		 - See this in expanded archaeological visibility of coins and shipwrecks

### Hellenistic Pottery
 - Main ceramic change: Swift decline in red-figure pottery
 - Few early Hellenisti wares experiment with polychrome painting
 - Plain black-gloss or grey-gloss wares, some with incised ornamentation, are common
 - Also sees a rise in molded ceramics rather than wheel thrown, with impressed (stamped) decorations
 - These black and grey wares also very popular in early Republican Italy, might be attempting to imitate tarnished silver tableware of elites
 - Use of lekythoi for storing and pouring oil also declined sharply in Hellenistic times, theyre replaced by ceramic (and increasingly glass) unguentaria

### Hellenistic Death and Burial
 - Classical limits on burial ostentation were totally gone by Hellenistic era
 - Macedonians always had stratified society, combined lavish tombs with Classical art from south Aegean
 - Most spectacular examples of Hellenistic tombs from Aigai, original Macedonian capital
	 - Series of traditional earthen tumuli enclosed barrel vaulted stone tombs, with facades resembling southern Greek temples, all elaborately painted
 - Cemeteries at this time had a wide range of burials, from simple cist and earth tombs for ordinary people, to larger vaulted chambers for middle class families
 - Large Macedonian tombs reserved for elites
 - Gifts in tombs include precious metals, pottery, some with wall paintings

### Hellenistic Hygiene
 - Burials give insight into acts of cleanliness
 - Grave goods of strigils and mirrors increase 10x in the Hellenistic Era vs Classical period
	 - Increase in personal grooming, concern with appearance
 - Items appear (for the first time) in graves of women in great numbers
 - Rise of individualism, participation of women might be shifting to depict women as attractive and desirable persons rather than simple managers of the household, wives, or mothers.
