# Roman Greece
### Pausanias
 - Traveler and geographer who explored Greece (150-180 CE)
 - Wrote about monuments, cities, sacred sites, geographical features
 - Series of 10 books called Description of Greece
 - Archaeology shows he was remarkably correct in his descriptions, still consulted today

### Roman Landscape Reorganization
 - By end of first century CE, Greece separated into four distinct provinces
	 - Southern Greece: Province of Achaea
		 - Corinth was administrative capital, Athens was cultural hub
		 - Included the Cycladic islands
	 - Northwest Greece: Province of Epirus, capital at Nicopolis
	 - Northeast Greece: Province of Macedonia, capital at Thessaloniki
	 - Crete administered along with coastal Libya as province of Crete and Cyrene, capital at Gortyn
 - Pax Romana brought internal peace to Greece and stimulated economic growth

### Middle Roman Landscape
 - Greece entered a period of recovery and economic growth
 - Only demographic impact before crisis years (3rd century) was the Antonine Plague (165-180)
	 - Know about it thanks to writings of Greek physician Galen
	 - First plague to affect Roman people, unyielding to traditional sacrifice to gods may be responsible for rise of Christianity
 - Archaeologically: Small peasant farmsteads not reoccupied. Growth of villa estates and villages

### Roman Villas in Greece
 - Two main social classes owned villas in Greece:
	 - Settled Roman veterans or colonists of middling class
	 - Very wealthy Greek and Roman landowners (including senators)
	 - Herodes Atticus (101-177), Marcus Aurelius' rhetoric teacher, well known benefactor of Roman Greece: Very famous in the Antonine Period, mentioned by many ancient authors
 - Large and small rural estates, have access to major roads, close to water supplies, sometimes own cemeteries
 - Variable agriculture potential of Greek soils
	 - Small farmsteads mostly better suited for smaller patches of arable land
 - With Rome: Villas appear in regions with largest and most fertile lands (several plains)
 - Middle and lower classes declined, small plots disappear, others in the hands of the rich
 - Possible the landscape wasn't entirely controlled by villa elites. Poor farmers working villa estates along with their own smaller plots of land (commuter-farming) is archaeologically invisible
 - Villas in Macedon see major wave of construction in second century CE
	 - New villas more modest in size with standard Roman features, decorated with opus sectile and opus signium
 - Villas around mountainous Epirus (pastoral+livestock based) see wave of construction from 1st-3rd centuries
 - Greek villas use Italian-style decoration (b+w mosaics, opus spicatum floors) but often built as Greek-style corridor farmhouses more often than the atrium or peristyle villas of Italy

### Estate of Herodes Atticus
 - Know of three Greek estates owned by him in the second century CE
	 - Suburban villa near Athens, family estate at Marathon, massive complex at Eua Loukou in Peloponnese
	 - Most interesting at Marathon, both inherited and new constructions, mini-polis dedicated to wife Regilla
	 - Eua Loukou is huge, no mere farm, with gardens, apartments, towers
 - Exceptional estates, ample epigraphic evidence tying them with historical texts about Atticus
 - Also perfect representations of the most luxurious rural villas that existed in Greece during Early and Middle Roman period

### Summarizing Rural Landscape
 - Old-occupied regions of Greece see decline or stagnation, underdeveloped areas see expanding rural settlement
 - Villas quickly dominate settlement hierarchy all over Greece
	 - Not exactly like Italian examples, often lacked bath facilities and rich mosaics
	 - Usually built in corridor-styles instead of atrium or peristyle forms
 - Aside from villas, most other sites were small, contained pottery for simple domestic use

### Early Roman Cities
 - Cities newly constructed or newly favoured by Rome resulted in shift in urban populations
	 - People moved from Hellenistic cities into fewer large-scale Roman favoured cities
 - Nicopolis in NW Greece: Numerous other urban centers in Hellenistic times, after city founded by Augustus no other towns survive. Landscape dominated by Nicopolis and nearby Patras
 - Decline in urban populations that isn't balanced by remaining cities
	 - Romans likely enslaved large portion of Greeks
 - Increase in honorific statues and numerous new public buildings and facilities
	 - Paid for by wealthy Greek and foreign Italian families
 - Houses in early Roman transitionary period continue Hellenistic trend of multiple entrances
	 - Changes in house design signal undermining of traditional Greek gender and class systems
	 - Roman tradition was designed to make it easier for everyone in society to build wealth

### Urbanization
 - Rather than hundreds of Classical city-states, only a few major centers emerged
 - Romans refounded Corinth and Patras, new center at Nicopolis, favoured Hellenic cities like Thessaloniki, Gortyn
	 - These cities were instantly rich, Greeks sought to live in or near them
 - Greek cities looked back to Classical heritage for building inspiration, little use for Roman concrete or brick
	 - Builders relied on traditional cut stone methods for public buildings into 4th century CE

### Roman Athens
 - Roman elites enamored with Athens and Roman debt to Greek civilization, rebirth of Athens
 - Emperor Hadrian used imperial funds to sponsor many developments in Athens
	 - Improved urban infrastructure, reoriented to focus on Roman Agora with library and university
 - Herodes Atticus built great odeon on southern slope of the Acropolis, new stadium to the east, renovated stadium at Delphi, built exedra at Olympia
 - Monuments were rededicated to various benefactors, recycling devotion depending who was in favour at times

### Roman Thessaloniki
 - Modern rebuilding allowed huge amount of archeology, excavations revealed monumental Roman center
 - Sided with Roman victors during turbulent early Republic, became favoured regional center
 - Rebuilt their town walls (many other cities let decline in early Empire), important for later successes

### Late Second Century CE Urban Developments
 - Slow introduction of Roman building materials like concrete and brick
 - Roman games (gladiator and beast fights) become popular in Greek cities, change in building styles
 - Greek theaters were set in hills with circular orchestra, many rebuilt in stone in Roman styles
 - Construction of aqueducts were significant improvement to urban life in Greece
	 - Most spectacular: Hadrianic aqueduct of Corinth, 100km long from middle of Peloponnese

### Early Roman Domestic Space in Greece
 - Greek houses similar in design to urban domus in Italy, evolved forms of Hellenistic houses before
 - Elaboration and wealth creation were top priorities, house styles reflected this
 - Change: Wealth coming less from agricultural surplus stored and processed in urban home
 - Some spaces could have been used for these purposes, more likely rich urbanites increasingly building rich rural estate centers (villas) to handle this work in the Greek countryside
 - Dining rooms (triclinia) were particularly important spaces for entertaining guests
	 - Also peristyle gardens and reception rooms
	 - Villa Dionysus at Knossos has mosaics in rooms adjacent to peristyle, detailing this importance

### Middle Roman Domestic Space in Greece
 - Plainer rural villas had urban and suburban counterparts, far more extravagant
 - Imperial and military officials increasingly replacing traditional urban elites (curiales) during Middle Roman period, bringing new levels of wealth to Greek cities
 - Atrium style entrance halls become more elaborate and central
	 - Spaces were reception areas for the lower status clients of the homeowner
	 - More elaborate reception rooms in back of house for more honored guests

### Women in Roman Greece
 - Elite women had more civic influence than the Hellenistic period
	 - Result of Roman customs, women granted more respect and more freedoms than old Greek society
 - Inscriptions in many Greek cities show women of wealthy families could hold public officies beyond cult-centers
	 - New offices included gymnasiarchs (gymnasium managers) and officials managing public revenue
 - Many statues and honorific inscriptions dedicated to elite women
	 - Roman city of images: all statues, monuments, inscriptions, created visual history of the city and benefactors
 - Claudia Metrodora (?-68 CE): resident of island of Chios, magistrate of island, vast wealth to provide feasts, build public baths, honored as basileia by the Aegean Ionian League of city-states
