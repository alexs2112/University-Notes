### Overview (500-600 CE)
 - Histories of eastern and western empire are different with the same outcome: Medievalism
 - Mid-sixth century CE is decisive for the western empire and it collapses
 - Eastern empire copes with sixth-century impacts, cannot survive conquests of Islam in mid-7th century
	 - Instead of collapse, the east simplifies and endures
 - Still archaeological commonalities for the end of the Ancient world visible in both Italy and Greece despite these different histories

### Authors at the End of Antiquity
 - Marcellinus Comes (?-534 CE): Constantinople, know little about him, chronicle of eastern empire from 370-534
 - Procopius of Caesarea (500-565 CE): Scholar with Belisarius during wars of Justinian. Recorded everything he witnessed, including spread of Justinianic Plague
	 - Wrote treatise "The Buildings" on Justinian's works, subversive "Secret History" on palace intrigue
 - Cassiodorus Senator (490-583 CE): Roman statesman who served Theoderic the Great
	 - Collection of letters gives insight into Ostrogothic governance in first half of 6th century.
	 - Wrote about climate change and the early Byzantine Gothic War
 - Theophanes the Confessor (758-818 CE): Byzantine aristocrat who became monk and scholar
	 - Large chronicle detailing eastern empire from Diocletian all the way to Michael I (813)
	 - Valuable work, gives insight on second half of sixth century with otherwise few texts

### Continuity and Discontinuity
 - Core debate between archaeologists and historians: Timing of the end of Roman influence in the Mediterranean
 - Historians - Continuists: Observe rhetoric of ancient sources (Christians lamenting end of the world from disease, weather, barbarians) appear overstated compared to non-religious economic + political sources
	 - Belgian historian Henri Pirenne (1935) said ancient world ended when Muslim armies conquered the south
	 - Result: End of Roman economic system, interregional influence shift from Rome + Constantinople to Mecca and Baghdad
	 - For these historians, ancient world didn't end, transformed into middle ages (Example: Survival of Christianity)
 - Archaeologists - Catastrophists: Identify discontinuities.
	 - Urbanism disappears in Germany, France, Spain, Balkans. Reduced form in Italy and Greece with significant contraction
	 - Wide availability of ARS pottery ends in western Europe (550) except for Rome, continues until 600 CE
		 - Eastern forms of ARS continue at Constantinople and Corinth, until Muslim forces conquer North Africa (7th century)
	 - Villa disappears from western Europe at different times, 550 villa landscape of Italy is ended
 - No simple way to describe the end of the Roman world, mix of regional continuities, discontinuities, transformations
	 - Some elements did definitively end: Roman Mediterranean economy, villa landscape, office of western emperor
	 - Survivals are present: Government doesn't disappear, Aaistocrats endure (defunded), church expands, farming continues
 - Example - San Giusto: Massive double-basilica church and cemetery for Christians built on foundations of a villa, imperial property before being donated to the church. Agricultural + pastoral activities didn't end when transformed into episcopal
	 - Continuity: Locale, structure foundations, agrarian activities
	 - Discontinuity: End of paganism, end of villa settlement, end of imperial ownership

### Odoacer's Roman Empire
 - Besides coinage, archaeology of Odoacer's Italy is indistinguishable from earlier 5th century
 - Empire contracted into a form more manageable with the resources and wealth of the period
	 - Europe fragmenting into small, more regional governments
 - Roman senate and villa agriculture continued

### Ostrogothic Italy
 - Eastern emperor Zeno didn't appreciate how Odoacer was ruling Italy
	 - 488: Paid Ostrogoths to invade Italy and remove Odoacer
	 - 493: Besieged Ravenna, Odoacer surrendered and was executed
 - Ostrogoths: No intention of being eastern Roman puppets, Theoderic the Great (475-526) created new kingdom of Italy
	 - Very Romanized, lived in the empire for many generations
	 - Brought stability and some prosperity, fixed infrastructure in Rome and Ravenna, funded landscape renewal in Campania
 - Descendents were less successful. Daughter Amalasuintha ruled as regent for young son. Boy was killed, attempted to broker peace with relatives but was also killed. Eastern Emperor Justinian (527-565) took her death as opportunity to retake the west
 - No distinctive Ostrogothic material culture (Romanized), archaeology still identifies changes in development of North Italy
	 - Two main ways: Development of fortresses; changes to urban fabric of north Italian cities
**Castelli**:
 - Ostrogoths entered Northern Italy, occupied/established new fortified centers at major passes through the Alps
	 - Best known: Castelseprio, Monte Barro, Sirmione, Garda
 - Some of these castelli: Built in 5th centuri, fortification walls around small agricultural settlements
	 - Others: Clear military fortifications with natural defenses
	 - Others: Larger structures to house locals in case of attacks (essentially small castles)
 - Excavations at Monte Barro (most important defense for Milan):
	 - Structures built in same style as Slovenian castella (where the Ostrogoths came from)
	 - Last deposit for this castellum (530-550) rooms of various barracks were partitioned by wooden walls (also in cities)
**Verona and Brescia**:
 - Urban structures from north Italian towns show Ostrogothic soldiers living in former middle/upper class domus
	 - Evidence for wooden partitioned walls, lots of pottery and coins (likely soldiers pay)
 - Urban archaeology at Verona and Brescia is most developed. Evidence for significant refortification during this period
 - Walls very difficult to date as they experience multiple phases of renovation over time
	 - Proxy evidence: Looks like Verona received updated defenses during Ostrogothic occupation
**Roman or Medieval**:
 - Theoderic the Great grew up at court of Constantinople as a political hostage
	 - Familiar with Roman forms of government, used Roman methods of appeasing the people (public infrastructure)
	 - Done through collection of land tax
 - Rest of the west: Fully medieval. No more land tax, other empires supplied armies and courts by confiscating former imperial land as gifts and taking food directly from land as needed. Start of vassalage and serfdom
 - Romanness of Ostrogoths is visible in the architecture of major cities
	 - Mausoleum of Theodoric (520 CE, Ravenna) is a miniature version of the tombs for Augustus and Hadrian
**Basilica of San Vitale**:
 - Ostrogoths were Arian Christians. Basilica (526-547) represents height of late Roman religious construction pre middle ages
	 - Only major church from Justinian the Great to be preserved almost intact and in original form
	 - Perfect blend of eastern and western architecture at the very end of the Roman period
		 - Western: Dome, stepped towers, doorway, window shapes
		 - Eastern: Polygonal apse, very flat bricks, flying buttresses
	 - Famous for having the best preserved and most spectacular golden mosaics outside Istanbul
	 - Late Roman mosaics not found primarily on floors, tesserae made from glass, pearl, marble (with silver/gold leaf)

### 536 CE: Worst Year in Human History
 - According the historian Michael McCormick, worst time to be alive in recorded European history
 - Significant climatic event (series of volcanic eruptions) created a dry fog. Dimming the sun for 18 months, lowered global temperature to its coldest levels in the last 2000 years. Agriculture largely impossible
 - 540-543: New pandemic disease appears: Bubonic plague, aka Justinianic Plague
	 - Much debate over impact of this disease
 - Italians: Period also included military conflict (Byzantine-Gothic War) where eastern emperor Justinian attempted to retake parts of the western empire for the ROmans
	 - Resulted in destruction of Italian landscape, definitive end of Roman-Style life in Italy
**The Byzantine-Gothic War (535-554)**:
 - 535 CE: After defeating Persians and conquering North Africa for Justinian, general Belisarius landed in Italy
 - 540 CE: Retaken Naples, Rome, Ravenna, Milan for the Romans. Empire was reforming
 - Belisarius recalled by Justinian for unclear reasons. War of attrition began as new Ostrogothic King Totila (541-552) clawed back nearly the whole peninsula from inept and corrupt eastern administrators
	 - Justinian sent new general Narses to regain peninsula, by 553 Totila was dead, most Ostrogoth strongholds surrendered
 - Not a war of numerous pitched battles(some decisive battles did occur), late antiquity tactics promoted siege warfare
	 - Small armies surrounded fortified settlements, either took them or were repelled
	 - Warfare was becoming medieval
**The Late Antique Little Ice Age (536-551 CE)**:
 - As Belisarius was occupying Rome, significant climatic event noted all over Europe and central Asia
	 - Cassiodorus calls it a dry fog, dimming the sun for 18 months
	 - Crops withered and died, Christian writers described it as the end of the world
 - Dendrochronological studies in Alps, North Europe show slowest tree growth over last 6000 years (536-551 CE)
	 - Alpine Glaciers: 5 out of the 20 coldest decades over entire Holocene occurred between 500-600 CE
 - Theory: Volcanic events created dust veil that engulfed the entire planet, dimming solar radiation
	 - Also period of intense famine and disease
**The Justinianic Plague (541-750 CE)**:
 - First noted in Egypt in 541 CE. By 543 this illness being described in Italy and Greece (while Totila reclaimed Italy)
 - Disease: Bubonic Yersina Pestis, the Black Death. 1/3 to 1/2 of Europe was killed by this plague
	 - Travelled from black rats to humans via flea bites, spread only possible by interconnected economy
 - Mostly a disease of the cities, but graves as far away as northern Germany contained traces
	 - Spread nearly everywhere, continued to flare in urban disease pools in Constantinople until 750s
 - Justinian attempted to dispose of corpses (10k/day) by digging mass graves outside the walls of Constantinople
	 - None of these have been found
	 - Studies of graves of 3-4 victims all over Europe suggest significant increase in mortality in mid 6th century
 - Procopius: mentioned urban defenses all over eastern empire were being used as morgues
 - John of Caesarea: Dead were cross-hatched in layers, hay in a stack, victims trodden upon by feet and trampled
	 - Winepress of the fury of the wrath of god

### End of the Roman Landscape in Italy
 - Invasion of eastern Romans set off chain reaction devastating Italian people and their landsape
 - Procopius: Both Byzantines and Ostrogoths decimated all agricultural land they encountered to feed their soldiers
	 - Insecurity made travel treacherous
	 - Siege warfare resulted in urban famine
 - Villa system broke down completely, last villas all abandoned, Vici in the landscape endured but in reduced forms
 - Richest Italians fled, most to Constantinople and southern Aegean
 - Only Roman institution that survived the war: The church, Bishops became de facto city leaders

### Arrival of the Middle Ages: The Lombards
 - After defeating the Ostrogoths, Justinian issued a Pragmatic Sanction in 554 to reorganize Italy
	 - Implemented high taxes on Italians, stymied any chance for economic or social regeneration
 - 568: Germanic group called the Lombards entered Italy from the eastern Alps
	 - Not Romanized, structured on warrior elites and kingly rule
	 - Quickly established themselves in major cities, took possession of all imperial lands making them rich
 - Weakened Italians stood no chance, Lombards conquered whole peninsula, ending Roman gov't and economy
	 - Landscape highly regionalized, authority from kings and dukes through gifts of land and payment in labour
 - Start of medieval Italy

### Greece
 - Social, military, political processes beginning in the 4th and 5th centuries find logical concclusions in the 7th
	 - Like Italy, Greece experiences urban decline, large-scale landscape abandonment
 - Chronologies of decline and abandonment are dependent on local circumstances
 - Between 6th-7th centuries, raids by Huns and Slavs reached critical levels
	 - Late 6th century: Slavic colonization of the Balkans and raids into imperial territory began
	 - Slavic occupation of Greece didn't happen until the 7th century
 - Unlike Ostrogoths or Lombards, Slavs didn't topple the eastern government. Eventually welcomed into eastern armies and given abandoned farmland

### The Medieval Future
 - The east survived, but in a transformed state
	 - West buckled from mid-sixth century
	 - East continued until Muslim advance destroyed eastern wealth
 - Rather than collapse, Emperors Heraclius (610-641) and Constans II (641-668) shrunk the eastern empire to withstand losses.
	 - Decomplexified eastern society, reduced aristocratic bureaucracy, imposed military control (thema)
	 - Greek cities were essentially villages, Constantinople was the closest urbanized center to the Aegean
 - Made the eastern empire medieval: Emperor controlled the army directly and the army controlled the land
	 - World of decentralized and small militarized polities. Any form of democracy was gone
	 - People living in cities worked to supple the royal entourage and conduct small scale trade
	 - Rural people subjugated by military landlords, hereditary lands, obliged to give labour service (serfdom)
