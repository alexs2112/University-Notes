### Overview of the Archaic Period
 - 700-480 BCE
 - Period covers roughly two centuries: end of the EIA and the Persian Wars
 - Age of Experiment (Anthony Snodgrass)
 - Many pottery styles, temple and housing forms, all continue into Classical Period
 - Revival of literacy, first coinage, spread of city-state (polis) in Greece, Southern Italy
 - Southern Greek society trending more towards democracy, wont finish until Classical Period
 - Lower classes, slaves, women, do not have equal representations

### Orientalising in the Archaic Period
 - Connections with Near East and Egypt led to adoption of alphabet, trade relationships, mythology, revival of art
 - Most clearly in material culture. Most active orientalising center was Corinth
	 - Proto-Corinthian pottery was produced and shipped into Levant, Western Mediterranean

### Proto-Corinthian Pottery
 - Made in Corinth, images derived from the Near East
	 - Plants, animals, monsters
 - Women are absent, violence is common, reflects male-centered proto-polis society, aggression encouraged?
 - Pottery forms continued from Geometric periods, sizes shrank in Archaic

### Black Figure Pottery
 - 650-625 BCE, first examples, immensely popular and artists are known based on maker autographs
 - Creation: Illustrations on raw claw, painted in glossy black paint
	 - Backgrounds are then incised and picked out, revealing orange or white ceramic underneath
	 - Ceramic is coated in clear glaze and fired
 - Most continued animal and plant theme until 550 BCE, potters from Athens developed narrative themes
 - Most came from Corinth, Athens, Sparta, and eastern Greece
	 - Also a famous Black-Figure potter at Cerveteri in Italy, made more broadly in Etruria

### Kouroi and Korai
 - Figurative depictions shift to include full human forms
 - Freestanding Kouroi and Korai sculptures, some life-size, some up to 3m tall, situated at sanctuaries and cemeteries all over the mainland and south Aegean islands
 - Unknown exactly what they depict, likely divinities, dedicatees, memorials
 - Originally brightly coloured, likely very costly to commission
 - Kouros: Naked male youth
 - Kora: Clothed maiden

### Archaic Greek Society
 - Political and intellectual battleground between advocates of traditional aristocracy and those for middling civic society
 - Unstable control by competing basileis of the EIA yield to power of assemblies, lawcourts, consensus of free citizens
	 - Would shift Greek proto-states into full city-states or poleis
 - Aristocrats still held onto power as judges and politicians who seek the common good, maintain status of heroic warriors
 - Proto-states exist alongside tribal social organizations called ethne, would become kingdoms in Classical period

### Archaic Burial
 - Social tensions displayed here
 - After Late Geometric Revolution (all classes could access cemetery burial), weapons disappear from earliest Archaic burial, decrease in wealth differentiation
 - Internments in stone-lined cists, cremation in urns, cemeteries are moved outside town sites
 - Wealthy still existed and aristocrats controlled society. Led to adopting new status displays
	 - Tombs decorated by carved/painted reliefs, inscriptions, prestigious Kouroi and Korai

### Cylonian Affair
 - Phaleron cemetery used in the Archaic and Classical periods, over 1500 burials, 500 being infants or children
 - 2016: Two mass graves, 80 bodies, many shackled with hands above head or behind back
 - Dated 750-480 BCE, suggests victims of earliest recorded event in Athenian history, Cylonian Affair
	 - 632 BCE: Cylon, olympian winner, attempted a coup to become dictator of Athens, not supported and his supporters were killed, these skeletons may be those men

### Cultural Evolution of the Polis
 - Cultural Evolutionary Theory: Suggests poleis began as kin and city based political formations
	 - These tribes would operate in wider regional groups based on shared culture, language
	 - Increasing social complexity, evolve into city-state civic societies
	 - Too simple and straightforward, archaeological evidencec doesn't match
 - Current evidence:
	 - Unlikely to have ethnic foundations
	 - Displacements and depopulation of LBA results in patchwork of settlements in EIA
	 - Later geometric, early archaic we see recrystallization of political structures, settlement communications
 - Recrystallization occurs depending on:
	 - Internal developments and acquisition of territory, unique to each settlement and location
	 - Settlement type, village-states, to federations of towns and hamlets, to territorial kingdoms
 - Shared Greek identity doesn't appear until 5th century during Greco Persian wars
	 - Ddevelops in opposition to threat of invading peoples (Schismogenesis)

### Archaic City
 - Don't know much, know most about Athens but is not representative
 - Archaic city (asty) developed out of EIA clusters of houses or hamlets
 - Buildup of relatively dense private and public sectors focused on an urban sanctuary and public square (agora) all defended by a wall
 - Some towns had upper town (acropolis) typically outside urban walls, used for refuge
 - Domestic Architecture sees a return to elaborate rectilinear multi-room houses with courtyards
	 - Roof tiles return in this period

### Hoplite Reform
 - Social changes of late Geometric resulted in rise of the middle class
	 - Derived from elites, did not reflect a rise of the peasantry
	 - Over most of the Archaic, city-states were ruled by kings/family oligarchies/aristocratic groups
 - Culture of warrior elites in the EIA (single combat) was reformed by adoption of massed rankes of armed middle-class citizen foot soldiers (hoplites)
	 - Also group of lightly armed lower-class serfs, less privileged soldiers (peltasts)
 - Return to the armies last seen during Mycenaean time
	 - Each army would have different armor and shield preferences, archaic soldiers preferred more armor generally while classical armies would favour agility with light armor
 - Few soldiers wore heavy armor, helmets allowed easy vision forwards and to each side
 - Operated in a formation called the phalanx
	 - Heavy shields on the left, spears/javelins on the right
	 - Fought as a unit
	 - Heavily armored aristocrat cavalry would lead the phalanx, fight on horseback or on foot
 - Armored greaves protected them from low spears, limited mobility
	 - If a phalanx was broken, little hope of escaping
 - Growing middle class challenges the traditional power of the EIA basileis

### Urban Sanctuary
 - Temple, central integrative role in the community likely originates from great house ceremonies of the EIA (Lefkandi)
 - Rising influence of the middle class along with stronger sense of citizenship to the polis vs kin
 - Growth of public conspicuous consumption, votive offerings at shrines explode in number
	 - Items that would previously be buried with individuals are now being deposited for public display
 - Laws are being inscribed on temples, applying to both the rich and the poor
 - Not places for communal feasting or group events, built to house deity statues and store offerings for gods
 - Votive offerings: Gifts to the gods in return for divine favour, could be almost anything
 - Votives were put on display for a set period of time, then ritually discarded into pits or wells
 - Sacrifice occurred outside temples, could include deposits of plants, ritually-killed animals, wine, oil, foodstuff
 - Monumental Temples emerge during the Archaic, differentiated mainly by their columns (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian orders)
	 - Best examples: Hekatompedon (hundred foot) temples of Eretria, Samos, Athenian Acropolis
	 - Archaic Athenian temple built 570-550 BCE, replaced in 490 BCE by the Parthenon

### Extramural Sanctuaries
 - Protopoleis assimilated surrounding villages, their centers needed symbolic incorporation
 - Sacred processions from the polis to satellite sanctuaries to remind who possessed their spiritual+political power
 - Eleusis was particularly important (center of Eleusinian Mysteries), secret initiations for the cult of Demeter and Persephone
	 - Eventually achieved Panhellenic status, rites performed until 4th century AD, destroyed by Christians

### Panhellenic Sanctuaries
 - Panhellenic: Open for all Greeks
 - Provided theaters for display between elites from growing proto-poleis
 - Unknown exactly what occurred at these sanctuaries, cult rituals likely allowed for city-state competition
 - Panhellenic games were likely (Olympia), sites like Delphi had reputation for oracular divination + gods

### The Agora
 - Equally important Archaic development, main square of the polis
 - Supported open-air assembly, non-aristocratic classes were given opportunity for political participation
 - Space for basileis and elders to bring issues to the populace
	 - Later laws were dispensed in the agora, lively spaces for commerce
 - EIA cities had similar spaces, not until late 8th century BCE (Crete) where we start seeing archaeological traces

### Fruits of State Formation
 - Use of writing included law codes to be inscribed and displayed in the agora
	 - Demonstrating victory for civic values over aristocrats
	 - Further encouraged democratic reforms
 - Writing also helped levy a more consistent land tax, made possible by introduction of coinage from early 6th century BCE Lydia (Turkey)
	 - Large denominations of silver were common at first, eventual smaller bronze coins
	 - Money now used in everyday transactions by ordinary citizens
 - Appearance of coinage further reduced elite control, allows commoners to accumulate wealth and investments
 - By 500 BCE, coins minted and circulating all over the Aegean and Greek colonies
 - Economic revolution made market activity a central feature of life for everyone
