# Colonization of Italy
### Did Roman Colonization Urbanize Native Italians
 - Regional Pathways to Complexity (RPC) project (1990s):
	 - Compare landscape trends in 3 Italian regions
	 - Goal to investigate whether Roman influence resulted in homogenous process of urbanization
	 - Looked at changing sizes of larger sites and the scale of rural sites (that in-fill the landscape) to understand how the arrival of Rome impacted landscape organization
	 - Urbanism wasn't something Rome brought to Italy, Roman colonization efforts were part of a wave of urbanization in the peninsula
 - Survey archaeology and excavation demonstrates that as Rome expanded and colonies were founded, these places operated autonomously
	 - Huge number of native Italians rather than Roman settlers
 - Extension of citizenship, new patterns of socioeconomic integration and mobility were transformative
	 - Trade, marriage, military serivice all allowed Italians to take part in Roman society

### Italy in 4th-3rd Century BCE
 - Rome continues to expand, pressures neighbouring communities into alliances
	 - First two Samnite Wars all ended with alliances in favour of Rome (Alexander the Great)
 - Wars with Etruscan cities restarted in 311 BCE, brought Umbrians into path of Rome
 - End of 3rd century BCE, Rome settling new colonies in Etruria
	 - Disrupts ability for indigenous communities to band together, resist Roman hegemony
 - Samnites tried to unite central Italy (3rd time) against Romans, led coalition of Etruscans, Umbrians, Gauls.
	 - Battle at Sentinum in 295 BCE (largest) was another Roman victory
	 - Samnites defeated, Rome moved into Campania (290 BCE), colonies at Beneventum & Venusia

### The Pyrrhic War (280-275 BCE)
 - After Samnite Wars
 - Greek cities of Magna Graecia were concerned with Rome's expansion south
	 - Tarentines called on Pyrrhus (king of Epirus) for defense. Brought army with war elephants
 - Pyrrhus arrived in Heraclea in 280 BCE
	 - First time Romans fought an eastern Mediterranean power
	 - Moderately successful, routing Romans in the south, marching onto Rome, campaigning in Sicily
 - Last battle occurred outside Benevento
	 - Pyrrhus victory due to war elements, suffered massive losses
	 - Pyrrhus abandoned Magna Graecia, by 272 BCE most of the southern cities under Rome
 - Little direct evidence for Pyrrhic conflict aside from some sites in Campania
 - More direct evidence from coins in Syracuse bearing his name
 - Carthaginians and Greeks inhabiting Sicily fought for, and then against, Pyrrhus
	 - State of shifting alliances, continue to afflict Rome for the rest of first millenium BCE

### Italy in the 3rd Century BCE
 - Rome continues to expand, Italians profited from association with Rome
	 - Veterans received land grants, communities received spoils of war, local aristocracies supported by Rome through financing and nepotism
	 - Ethnicities were reinforced rather than stamped out, reducing animosity towards Romanization
 - Urban centers in central, southern Italy grew larger
	 - Cities in Etruria and Latium, urbanised earlier, continue to flourish
	 - Each city had group of elected magistrates, worked with local elites to fund public works

### First Punic War (264-241 BCE)
 - Roman expansionism was devastatingly effective on land, little use for a navy
 - Carthaginians decided to intervene
 - First time Romans fought a major overseas power
	 - Fought mainly as naval battles around Sicily, 20 year war financially devastating for both sides
 - Toward end of conflict, Rome rebuilt its fleet in 243 BCE using loans from Roman aristocracy, timber from great Sila forest of Burttium
	 - Modelled their ships (200) after Greek quinqueremes

### Archaeology of the Battle of the Aegates
 - 241 BCE, fleet of 250 Carthaginian quinqueremes arrived off Sicily
	 - Plan to come ashore,  march to relieve blockade at Lilybaeum
 - Romans, 200 ships, caught Carthaginians west of Levanzo. Cut masts and anchors to make themselves more maneuverable and launched their attack
	 - Devastating bronze rostra (rams), sunk 50 Carthaginians and captured 70
	 - Rest fled using favourable winds, Romans couldn't pursue
 - 2017, depth of 80 mbsl, two ornate rostra were recovered west of Levanz
	 - One with legible Punic inscription
	 - 10 bronze Montefortino war helmets also recovered, 1 with lion skin motif - Roman commander
	 - These finds allow us to precisely locate the location of the battle

### Second Punic War (218-201 BCE)
 - 219 BCE: Carthage took Roman allied city in Spain, Rome declared war
	 - Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca surprised by invading northern Italy over the Alps with his army and war elephants
 - Won several large scale battles, eventually inflicting enormous defeat on Romans at Cannae in 216 BCE, at 16 legions this was the largest army the Romans had ever assembled
 - Hannibal's victories caused many Italian allies to defect to Carthage
	 - They still had the power to decide their own foreign policy
 - From 211 BCE, Roman commander Publius Scipio took the offensive to the Carthaginians first in Spain, then in Africa
	 - Defeated Hannibal at the Battle of Zama, Carthage surrrendered
 - Rome would eventually win the Punic wars and destroy Carthage in 146 BCE
	 - Italians that sided against Rome were punished economically, had lands confiscated
	 - Rome continued to provide new arenas of political interaction, helped these cities grow in size and wealth
 - Archaeology of Roman towns demonstrated most that were under Roman hegemony (including colonies) remained administratively autonomous until after the Second Punic War

### Battlefield at Cannae
 - Virtually no trace of the famous battle that occurred here
 - Reasons:
	 - Ancient pitched battles didn't often result in significant landscape modifications
	 - Fallen soldiers collected from battlefields, armor and weapons recycled
	 - Locals would have scoured the battlefield looking for small items left behind
 - Scholars agree Cannae was a turning point in Roman history, largest defeat, still controlled Italy

### Pottery and Italian Culture
 - Main archaeological signs of the growth of Roman political influence is paralleled by imported Roman pottery, particulayl black-gloss
 - Isn't total replacement of earlier wares
	 - Umbrian funerary urns and stelai show strong Etruscan influence
	 - Samnium shows increased black-gloss ware imports, not at expense of material connections with southern Italy
 - Despite Roman expansions, indigenous cultures continued to maintain traditional links and practices

### Case Study: Allied Integrations in Samnium
 - After second Punic war, Rome dominant and Samnites needed to comply
 - Significant material changes in archaeological record over 3rd-2nd centuries BCE
 - Cult sites in Samnium are monumentalized with large Hellenistic style temples
 - Pottery evidence shows for the first time that Samnite elites were importing foodstuffs outside Italy
 - Monte Vairano: Revenues from agriculture & craft production allow elites to import olive oil & wine
	 - Huge number of Rhodian (Greek) wine amphorae
 - Use of black-gloss table ware shows a shift in consumption practices from communal to individual
 - Import of Rhodian wine (from Ancona or south Italy) is interesting
	 - Samnium produced its own wine
	 - Evidence of wine amphorae from other parts of Italy, why import all the way from Rhodes
 - They needed to be discerning customers, consume products in a manner befitting social and political relationship with Rome
	 - Wanted to be seen as partners rather than subjects, adopt Hellenistic material culture

### Romanization or Hellenization
 - Rome tightens control over Italian peninsula in 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, marked by spread of Hellenistic culture inspired by Greece and successors of Alexander the Great (not Roman culture)
 - Hellenization of Roman art, architecture, literature gains momentum after Second Punic War
	 - Primarily due to Italian elites negotiating their Roman political culture through their Mediterranean trade connections
 - Alexander and successors had little direct impact on Italy, Hellenization was pervasive

### Economy of Expansion
 - Economic and territorial expansion went hand in hand.
 - Italian cons of Roman alliances:
	 - Requirement to supply and pay for troops
	 - Must follow Roman foreign policy
	 - Must submit to Roman political hegemony
 - Italian pros of Roman alliances:
	 - Share of war spoils
	 - Land assignment to allied veterans
	 - Roman support of local aristocracies
	 - New commercial networks formed by Rome's growing hegemony
 - Spread of pottery like Black Gloss and Gnathia ware is indicative of growing Italian economy fueled by Roman expansion

### Motor of the Roman Economy
 - Centuriation, roads, drainage programs, all contributed to the engine of the Roman economy: **Agriculture**
 - Regional variations, decline in occupation in Bruttium and Lucania despite praries and forests dominating the landscape

### Mediums of Exchange in the Early Republic
 - Fifth century Rome exported little, relied on importing grain due to mountainous, marshy territory
 - As Rome expanded, more integration with Mediterranean economy. We can trace this through money. Transition from direct exchange to use of established medium of value was crucial
 - Late in adopting coinage, evolved: Barter system -> Cattle-exchange -> Bronze ingots (aes rude)
	 - Eventual formed bronze tokens appear, clipped and distributed as unmarked bars (aes formatium) -> Then marked (aes signatum) varieties appeared
	 - Development of formed bronze tokens stimulated by introduction of military pay (stipendium)
 - Coins arrive in second half of the 4th century BCE (lateres signati), Romans mint their own by 269 BCE to trade with the Italo-Greeks

### Terra Marique: Land and Sea
 - Landscape perspetive of Roman economy: Profit for Italians came from land and sea
 - 339 BCE: Romans settled into Ager Falernus, making Campani into Roman citizens
	 - Brought into direct contact with Neapolis in 326 BCE, mutual peace agreement
	 - Naples supplied Rome with ships
 - 312 BCE: First consular road, the Via Appia, built between Rome and Capua
	 - Debate over road for bulk transport of goods, at least pack animals could use it
 - With river transport, landscape supported Rome's economic expansion with numerous trading partners/conquered subjects
