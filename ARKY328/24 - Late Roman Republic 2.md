# Architecture and Landscape
### Residential Decor
 - **Wall Plaster**: Covered stone walls with white lime plaster, some rooms painted with intricate frescos
 - **Mosaics**: Floor/wall mosaics not uncommon, practice originated in 4th century Greece and Romans adopted
	 - Forms: opus tesselatum (tesserae > 4 mm) and opus vermiculatum (tesserae < 4 mm), both often used
 - **Other Floor Styles**:
	 - Opus Signinum: Mixed mortar with pieces of crushed tiles and bricks
	 - Opus Sectile: Wall and floor decoration, cut pieces of marble to make regular geometric/lifelike scenes
	 - Opus Spicatum: Long thin rectangular pieces laid in herringbone pattern

### Vitruvius and De Architectura
 - Interpretation of houses relies on the writings of Vitruvius (80-15 BCE)
 - Corresponding interpretations are difficult to sustain with archaeological data (result in circular arguments)
 - Vitruvius' work provided useful names for different construction techniques observed:
 - **Opus Quadratum**: Squared blocks of similar height cut to create even courses, mortar often not used
	 - Technique often for monumental (Colosseum) or load bearing structures like arches
 - **Opus Isodomum**: Extremely even form of wall construction with perfectly cut regular ashlars
	 - Style differs from opus quadratum as courses are roughly the same height
	 - Used throughout most periods, not useful for establishing construction dates
 - **Opus Caementicium**: Roman concrete, hydraulic-setting cement "Pozzolana" using volcanic sand
	 - Imperial period: Often faced with stone or bricks, could build underwater port structures
 - **Opus Incertum**: After Caementicium, concrete core in which fist-sized rocks were inserted to create a moderately flat surface, all typically irregular
 - **Opus Reticulatum**: Concrete core, using diamond-shaped cubilia placed in regular net-like pattern
	 - Characterizes transition between Republic and Imperial periods
 - **Opus Latericium**: Also called **opus testaceum** (using tiles), Roman brick masonry
 - **Opus Mixtum**: Mix of Reticulatum and Latericium, popular during reign of Hadrian
 - **Opus Vittatum**: Popular in 4th century CE, several different styles, used until 6th century CE Italy

### Late Republic Countryside
 - Previously: Agriculture thought to be characterized by crisis, upheaval, warfare. Aristocratic hunger for land with a vacant peasant population (usually soldiers) led to reliance on slave labour
	 - Lower class farmers squeezed out, could not compete
 - Now: Rise of great slave-owning estates at the expense of small farmers is overstated
	 - This did happen, impacts were regional
 - Impossible to identify a single landscape-scale settlement, land use, economic trend for all of Italy
 - Survey is an excellent way to collect data, each research group has their own way of conducting surveys
	 - Result is very few comparative studies are attempted
	 - Realities of the past would still apply its own constraints

### Common Site Types for Roman Italy
 - **Town**: Urban center by historical sources, evidence for monumentality
	 - Residential, economic, political functions
 - **Road Station**: Site attested either epigraphically or by large concentration of material/structures along principle route
 - **Village**: Large scatter of material and structures, multihousehold settlement/agriculture site
	 - Limited evidence for wealth or luxury
 - **Villa**: Large scatter of surface material with significant quantities of pottery and building materials
	 - Consistent multiple indicators of luxury or architectural complexity
 - **Farm**: Small to medium size scatters of material including pottery and building material
 - **Building**: Small, discrete scatter of material/structural remains that indicate architectural feature

### Survey in Southern Italy
 - After defeat of Hannibal, Romans supposedly punished southern Italian indigenous groups who supported Carthage during Second Punic War
 - After 200 BCE: punishment in form of economic sanctions and confiscating parts of landscape
	 - Parts of this land converted into ager publicus (public state owned land)
	 - Other parts sold to wealthy landowners who created large farming estates
 - 1965: Hannibal's Legacy by Arnold Toynbee: Suggest the punishment depressed Southern Italy so bad it never recovered, even 2100 years later
 - Archaeological survey helped to disprove this while demonstrating there was no single overarching landscape story for late Republican Italy
	 - No set administrative or regional pattern emerges for Late Republic as theorized by Toynbee
	 - Western Lucania: Settlements followed indigenous Lucanian models even after imposition of Roman colony at Buxentum
	 - Eastern Lucania: Indigenous hilltop settlements abandoned, Roman villas overlay indigenous farms
	 - Upper Agri Valley: Recorded devastation during Second Punic War, settlement changes from indigenous to Roman style land use by rich senatorial families, farming mostly grain to sell
 - History would suggest that change should be violent and sudden, only Eastern Lucania might reflect this
 - The landscape variability was due to:
	 - Force of local aristocracy, relationship with Rome
	 - Areas closer to major road systems had greater chances of survival, could get products quicker to market
	 - Colonial settlements could act to push or pull settlement around it, largely depending on preexisting indigenous settlement pattern
	 - Fertility of the soil and hydrological resources could affect chances of finding large-scale productions

### Republican Landscape
 - Generalizations that archaeology has helped make about the late Republican rural landsacpe:
	 - Environmental parameters largely determined the altitudinal ranges that certain plants and terees could grow, humans ultimately decided these ranges. Over time, ranges fluctuated with climatic change
	 - Certain parts of the peninsula were more appropriate for particular kinds of agrarian systems, much variety at local level
	 - Roman victories over indigenous Italian groups caused general shift from nucleated settlement to dispersed settlement, most obvious in territories around large Roman cities and colonies
