### General State of the Imperial Period
 - Early Roman Empire, longstanding peace, economic prosperity, environmental stability
 - Augustus consolidated various positions into the Princeps
 - Pax Romana to convince Romans that trade and peace is more profitable than war and looting

### Well-Preserved Monuments in Rome
 - **Pantheon**: Temple to all the gods, largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world, best preserved, still in use as church
 - **Roman Victories**: Triumphal monuments celebrating military life, carvings depict details of battles, imperial propaganda
 - **Flavian Ampitheater**: The Colosseum, derived from bronze colossus of Nero, largest Roman Ampitheater constructed, munera

### Famous Woman Associated with Pompeii
 - **Eumachia**: Inherited family wealth, used in acts of euergetism, deeply involved in public affairs, worked into high social standing
 - Most magnificient building, statuary honored Augustus' wife Livia and her sons, patron for the guild of fullers (textiles)

### Early Imperial Economy Compared to Late Republic
 - Expansion of empire under Caesar, Pompey, Augustus came at high economic cost. Increased wealth of aristocrats
 - Italy and Campania as playgrounds of the wealthy. Size and complexity of economy similar in scale to Europe in 1700s
 - Italy increasingly marginalized as exporter of wine, oil, wheat, massive importer of all kinds of goods (not felt for a century)

### Annona
 - Comes from Italia annonaria lands after Diocletian reforms, also imported from Africa
 - Extremely important agricultural product

### Common Ceramic Styles from the Early Empire
 - **Arretine Ware and Italian Sigillatas (IS)**: red-gloss, Arretium (Arezzo), mold formed, very fine relief, diverse applique decorations
	 - Reign of Tiberius: Production of red-gloss outside Arretium, shipped everywhere, now called Italian/Terra Sigillatas
 - **African Red Slip Ware (ARS)**: Less refined, more orange than red, Tunisia & Algeria, huge quantities, no delicate firing of IS
	 - Travalled as ballast to Italy, subsidized by state-funded grain ships, made pottery so cheap that everyone could afford it
	 - Example of Italy becoming a net importer of goods
 - **Eastern Sigillata**: Greek style, originates in Turkey & Syria, red and black surfaced
	 - Shift to mostly red surface to copy Roman Terra Sigillata, style continues, gradually replaced by North African pottery
	 - 5 forms by production area, expert eye to compare to IS, decisive factor is base of vessels (some Greek maker stamps)

### Roman Burial Practices
 - Ritual funerary practices, celebration of life and accomplishment. Had to occur otuside city walls, could not inter in city
 - Cremation was the norm, richest Romans would get mausolea for ashes, even poorest were cremated
 - Small tombs built on roadsides commissioned by families or guilds
 - Examples: Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker (big baking oven), Pyramid Tomb of Cestius (strange politician, Nubian pyramid)

### Evidence for Early Christianity in Italy
 - Early iconography (fish) in catacombs, rarely in shrines (periods of few worshippers or prosecution)
 - Romans tolerated other religions as long as they took place in public festivals and sacrifices (opposed, led to persecution)
 - Catacombs cut by Christians and Jews, desirable as it placed them alongside martyrs, religious services conducted underground
 - Originally faced with bricks or marbles, then covered over in fresco paintings, valuable as main source of early Christian art

### Nature of the Greek Landscape in the Middle Roman Period
 - Greece reorganized into 4 distinct provinces
 - Southern - Achaea (Corinth, Athens, Cyclades); Northwest - Epirus (Nicopolis); Northeast - Macedonia (Thessaloniki);
   Crete & coastal Libya - Crete & Cyrene (Gortyn)
 - Period of recovery and economic growth, peasant farmlands not reoccupied, growth of villas & villages
 - Old occupied regions see decline or stagnation, underdeveloped areas see expanding rural settlement, villas quickly dominate

### Slavery and Greece
 - Early Roman Cities, shift in populations from Hellenistic to Roman sites by new cities or favoured Roman cities
 - Decline in urban populations of Greece that isn't balanced by remaining cities, Romans likely enslaved large portions of Greeks

### Roman Villas in Greece (and Herodes Atticus)
 - Owned by two social classes: Settled Roman veterans/Middle class colonists and wealthy landowners (like senators)
 - Varying sizes, access to major roads, close to water supplies, sometimes have cemeteries
 - Variable agriculture potential in Greece, smaller farmsteads better for smaller patches of arable land
 - Middle and lower classes and small plots decline, large plots in the hands of the rich, villas in Macedon see wave of construction
 - Commuter farmer archaeologically invisible
 - **Herodes Atticus**: 3 estates: Suburban villa near Athens; Family estate at Marathon; Complex at Eua Loukou in the Peloponnese
	 - Most interesting is Marathon, inherited and new constructions, mini polis dedicated to wife Regilla
	 - Eua Loukou is huge, gardens, apartments, towers, imperial property after his death in 177 CE

### Issues with Understanding Late Antiquity Archaeologically
 - Requires working with well-known historical sources, studied for centuries, avoid seeing every change as "decay"
 - Desire to generalize using little data, widescale interpretations for late antiquity flatten out intricacies of the past
 - Changes in pottery supply and distribution, can't date sites with as much chronological data as Early Imperial

### Late Antique Artwork
 - Portrait of the Four Tetrachs: Statue part of the wall, four bronze looking guys with swords and weird hats
 - Colossus of Constantine: Sitting on throne with big stick and toga, new style of statuary portraying elites as larger than citizens
 - Coin of Magnentius: Coin with guys head on one side, Chi Rho symbol on the other
 - The Battle of Milvian Bridge: Painting of a battle, bridge on right side, dark on left half and light on the right, flying people
 - Arch of Constantine: Triumphal arch between Colosseum and Palatine Hill, various origins of sculptural elements
 - Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus: Sarcophagus, a bunch of small cutouts of people standing around

### Reforms of Diocletian
 - Created the Tetrarchy, barracks emperors were chosen by ability instead of inherited. Destroyed from within by Constantine
 - Divided empire to dioceses, reflect defensive & economic potential, new capitals at Trier, Milan, Sirmium, Nicomedia (not Rome)
 - Italy separated into 2 economic cores: Italian Annonaria (annona agriculture), Italian Suburbicaria (suburban rich landowners)
 - Debasement of denarius ruining economy by inflation, tried and failed to establish fixed price edict
 - Diocletian's Economic Reforms as important document, reconciles idealized economy with real interpretations
 - Made Italian landowners pay taxes to the empire, affects how the rich manage their estates

### Architecture of Late Antiquity
 - **Spolia**: Pieces of destroyed older structures to construct new ones, access of resources was limited, needed to recycle
 - **Differences in Imperial and Late Antique Mosaics**: Remain very advanced, largely similar to early imperial times
 - **Reusing Temples for Christian Purposes**: Pagan temple worship meant to be outside temples, too small for Christians
 - **Basilicas**: Repurposed the basilicas for Christian use, many of the few buildings constructed in this period were basilicas
 - **Roof Tiles (Alla Cappucina Burials):** Tent-like structure made of recycled roof tiles, sometimes two tiles for libation wine tube
 - **Town Walls**: Originally Rome, then every northern town built, spoliation of older structures (difficult to date), well-engineered

### Late Antique Landscape
 - **Melania the Younger**: Inherited massive wealth, donated all to ecclesiastic institutions, used to grant sainthood
	 - Owned vast properties of forests, agricultural fields, pastures. Largest estates had 60 large houses, 400 slaves
 - **Abandoned Lands in Italy**: Warfare was localized around cities, Italians still needed food and tools
	 - Only cities received ARS shipments, little made it to the countryside, rural people began making coarsewares
	 - Late antique southern villas increase in size dramatically, rich fled to the east or country estates with incredible luxury
 - **Economic Boom of Greece**: Eastern provinces shipped goods and food through Aegean, enormously prosperous for Greece
	 - Creation of New Rome, increasing warfare requires more food, Greece intensifies agriculture, proliferation of villas
 - [familiarize yourself with site pictures]
	 - **Old Saint Peter's Basilica, Rome**: Basilica drawing, large basilica with a square courtyard structure outside of it
	 - Palace of Galerius in Thessaloniki: Weird sketch, only center coloured. Extremely large building with a circular guy connected
		 - Rotunda and Arch of Galerius
	 - Kastron at Rentina, Thessaloniki: Wooden structure still stands, base of wall with squares sporadically around, on hill
	 - City Walls of Verona: Looks like a path between buildings, walls on both sides
	 - Roman Ampitheater at Rimini: Semicircle in the grass, only the base of the ampitheater and some stairs remain
	 - Roman Baths at Albenga on the Ligurian Sea: A ruin next to a pond
	 - Ssan Giusto: Larger building on the edge of a pond, is a complex so includes a circle with some squares

### Conceptualizing Late Antiquity
 - Diocletianic Reforms, Constantinian Reunification to retake sole control of the empire
 - Major theme of **Continuity vs Discontinuity** between old and new life

### Odoacer's Italy
 - Odoacer killed magister militum of last western emperor (Romulus Augustulus, 12 yo) and deposed him to gain power
 - Sent imperial insignia to eastern emperor Zeno, allowed to rule Italy as Patrician (king) under Zeno
 - Archaeology of Odoacer's Italy is indistinguisahble from earlier 5th century, Europe fragments
	 - Empire contracts to be more manageable, senate + villas continue
 - Zeno disliked how Odoacer ruled Italy, paid Ostrogoths to invade, Odoacer surrendered and was executed
	 - Theoderic the Great created new Kingdom of Italy, descendents killed and Emperor Justinian retook the west

### Late Antique Little Ice Age
 - Cassidorus calls it a dry fog, dimming the sun for 18 months, crops withered and died
 - Dendrochronological studies in the Alps show slowest tree growth over the last 6000 years (5 out of 20 coldest decades)
 - Theory: Volcanic events engulf entire planet in dust, period of intense famine & disease, Christians describe as the end of world

### Justinianic Plague
 - Bubonic Yersina Pestis, the Black Death, travelled from black rats to humans via flea bites. First in Egypt, then Italy and Greece
 - Mostly a disease of the cities (interconnected trade), spread nearly everywhere, continued to flare in Constantinople until 750s
 - Justinian attempted to dig mass graves outside Constantinople, none found. Graves of 3-4 victims suggest increased mortality
 - Procopius: Mentioned urban defenses all over eastern empire were being used as morgues
 - John of Caesarea: Dead cross hatched in layers, victims trampled by feet, winepress of the fury of the wrath of god

### Famous Late Antique Mosaic
 - Best preserved golden mosaics outside Istanbul located at Basilica of San Vitale (Ostrogoths, height of religious construction)
 - Tesserae made of glass, pearl, silver and gold leaf marble, they shimmer in the candlelight
 - Examples: Lamb of God, Empress Theodora and her court, Emperor Justinian and his court

### Byzantine-Gothic War
 - Not a war of numerous pitched battles. Late antiquity tactics promote siege warfare
 - General Belisarius lands in Italy after defeating Persians and North Africa for Justinian. Retakes Naples, Rome, Ravenna, Milan
 - Belisarius recalled by Justinian, war of attrition, new Ostrogoth King Totila clawed back nearly whole peninsula
 - Justinian sent new general Narses to regain, by 553 Totila was dead, most Ostrogoth strongholds surrendered

### Possible Bonus Questions
 - Historians as Continuists: Ancient sources about end of world are overstated compared to economic & political sources
 - Archaeologists as Catastrophists: Identify discontinuities of reduced urbanism, disappearance of ARS and the villa
 - Indicators of Medievalism: Decomplexified society, small cities, militarized control, emperor controls the army directly, no democracy, rural people forced into serfdom
