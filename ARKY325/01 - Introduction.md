### Archaeological Study of Civilizations
**First Archaeological Research**:
 - Nabonidus, last king of Babylon, excavated temple of Ur in Mesopotamia to better understand Sumerian culture
 - Work contributed to knowledge of ancient Sumer
 - Motives were political, wanted to give rulership more prestigious origins
**Italian Renaissance**:
 - Modern archaeological roots (14th century)
 - Scholars rediscovered ancient Roman and Greek texts
 - Growing merchant class became interested in the Golden Age of Rome, collected Roman and Greek objects
 - Encouraged looting of ancient sites (beginning of antiquarianism), not good archaeology
**Rare Examples of Systematic Research**:
 - Ciriaco de Pizzicolli (Cyriacus of Ancona) (1391-1452)
 - Spent 25 years studying classic texts to locate ancient sites around the Mediterranean
 - Recorded these sites by writing down inscriptions, detailed drawings of monuments/architecture
 - Published his research (all lost in fires in 16th century)
**Grand Tour**:
 - Ideas of the Renaissance spread from Italy across Europe
 - Wealthy Europeans went on the Grand Tour of ancient monuments, "finishing school"
 - Often paid people to loot these sites to bring souvenirs home

### Antiquarianism
 - Collection of antiquities just for the sake of it
 - No careful documentation of context, don't know where it comes from or anything about it
 - Formed the foundation of Europe's national museums by the 19th century
 - For example: Lord Elgin's marbles in the British Museum
	 - Looting of the Parthenon, part of *national antiquarianism*
 - European nations systematically looted antiquities in other countries
	 - Famous looter: Giovanni Battista Belzoni (1778-1823)

### Professional Archaeology
 - Late 19th century: More systematic and scientific data collection methods were developed
	 - Became expectations of scientific research worldwide, not just within the discipline of archaeology
	 - Sir Flinders Petrie developed ceramic seriation
 - Archaeology and anthropology inspired by the works of prominent naturalists, geologists, biologists
	 - Such as: Charles Lyell, Charles Darwin

### What is Modern Archaeology
 - Scientific study of human past through the recovery of material and spatial evidence, including material culture
 - One of the four major fields of anthropology
	 - Biological Anth, Cultural Anth, Linguistic Anth, and Archaeology
 - 21st century archaeology is multidisciplinary
	 - Adopts techiques and methods from other earth sciences (geology, geography), genetics, philosophy, political science, psychology, etc
**Differs from Looting**:
 - Scientific study with the goal of interpreting the past
	 - Info comes from context of ancient materials recovered through careful excavation, recording, mapping
 - **Context**: Spatial and temporal association of an object with other objects in a site
 - Prefer to find objects *in situ* (in place)
	 - This is its **provenience**

### Sources of Data for Civilizations
 - Most information of ancient states comes from archaeology
 - Also interested in materials people left of their everyday lives
**Texts**:
- Written texts providing information about ancient states
- Not all states had texts, not all texts are deciphered
- Provide insight into how a society worked
	- Economy, politics, belief systems, values, poetry, law, ...
- Usually controlled by the elite population of the society
	- Often exaggerated or inaccurate recordings

### Civilizations, States, Complex Societies
 - Complex societies that archaeologists usually refer to as states
 - Complexity refers to the sophistication of social, economic, political organization within a society
 - States are fundamentally different from other types of societies in the complexity of their internal organization

### Evolutionary Stages
 - **No longer accepted**
 - Previous evolutionary models suggested that there is an inevitable linear progress of societies
 - Bands -> Tribes -> Chiefdoms -> States
	 - Uno-linear progression
	 - These are all successful societies, many lived side-by-side for centuries

### Types of Societies
 - Organized differently based on:
	 - How a society makes a living (produce surplus food? mobile or sedentary?)
	 - Social organization (kinship or classes)
	 - Decision making (consensus or elites)
	 - Population size, density on the landscape
 - Complexity is a description of the levels of organization in these different areas of life
	 - Not a value judgement

### States
 - Fundamentally different from other types of societies
 - Kinship is not the main principle or organization
	 - Always some sort of power structure
1. Government has full authority over all members of society
2. State authority is backed by force
3. Significant economic specialization
4. Social Inequality
**Current Approach**:
 - 2 primary characteristics that are focus of current research:
	 - **Urban living**: All states have densely packed populations
	 - **Centralized government** (the state)
 - But there are always exceptions
**Different Types of States**:
 - Differ in urban centers
 - **City States**: City as hub of commercial, ritual, social activity with people who have different jobs and status
 - **Territorial States**: Cities as political centers where elite/ritual specialists lived
	 - Rest of population lived in rural hinterland in smaller settlements
		 - Paid taxes to elites
	 - City was not source of services/craft products

### Cities
 - **Defined**: Large, relatively dense settlement with populations numbering in the thousands
 - **Central Places** offering specialized goods and services
 - **Interdependence** of city - hinterland
 - **Archaeological Visibility**: Scale, monumental architecture, internal spatial complexity
**Large Populations Need Central Authority**:
 - Cities require regulation to:
	 - Resolve disputes
	 - Acquire, redistribute resources
	 - Build needed infrastructure (irrigation, trade routes)
	 - Ideology to legitimate authority and unify population into a system of inequality
