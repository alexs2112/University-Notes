### Southern Area: Nazca (200 BCE-700 CE)
 - Same time as the Moche
 - South coast river valleys have smaller drainages and smaller populations
	 - Early villages in oases and areas with surface runoff for irrigation
 - By 500 CE: Tapped aquifers, dug tunnels to irrigate farmlands with spiral shaped tunnels from surface (puquios)
	 - Supported large population densities
**Cahuachi**: (0-500 CE)
 - Largest ritual center
 - Important shrine with 20m high stepped pyramid
 - Rituals focused on rain, water, fertility
**Pottery**:
 - Polychrome decoration
 - Style develops out of earlier Paracas art style
 - Most pots from looted cemeteries at Cahuachi
 - Pots show masked ritual performances of priests
**Nazca Lines**:
 - Geoglyphs: Designs of animals, birds, spiders, etc. along with geometric shapes
 - Created by over-turning dark stones from desert floor to expose underlying pink sand
 - Recent studies show that some lines run for 20km in straight lines
	 - Possibly pathways to areas of water
 - Lines radiate from high points, mountains, wells
 - May also have been used in rainmaking rituals
 - Lines are the same as designs found on pots and textiles
 - Lines are not oriented to astronomical observations
 - Recent studies show sacred landscape with lines walked and offerings made at locations along the lines (for water rites, fertility)
 - Not permanent ritual paths
	 - Sometimes new paths created on top of older lines

### Middle Horizon: First Highland States
 - Tiwanaku and Wari
	 - Same time as Moche
 - Peak in Middle Horizon (600-1000 CE) as Moche declines in the north

### Tiwanaku (500-1000 CE)
 - Founded on Altiplano near Lake Titicaca, good for camelid herding
 - 400 CE: Was a true city (25-40k people)
 - 600 CE: Trading with southern coast by llama caravan
 - 650 CE: Built major shrine on the Island of the Sun
 - Extensive trade in textiles, copper, objects, pottery, wooden objects, gold 
	 - Coastal trade by llama caravans
	 - Trade with southern coast for shell and fish
	 - Trade with tropical forest to the east for birds and medicines
 - Established colonies along trade routes and by military conquest
**Tiwanaku Sukacollas**:
 - Crops grown in raised fields in lakeside marshes and along canals (sukacollas)
 - Raised fields constructed with layers of stone cobbles, covered with clay, then 3 sheets of gravel and topsoil
	 - Prevented potatoes from freezing and becoming waterlogged
 - Low areas between raised areas fills with lake water
 - Highly productive (400% more potatoes than from plots on hillsides)
**Ritual**:
 - Tiwanaku was a large rectangular area with monumental construction
	 - 2 ceremonial earth platforms
	 - Covered 50 acres, aligned with cardinal directions
 - Public performance in these structures
	 - Leaders dressed in costumes as deities
	 - Human sacrifice important to their religion
 - Raised platform called Kalasasaya with carved stone "Gateway of the Sun"
	 - Not in its original place, substantial earthquakes have jumbled up the area
	 - Depicts Viracocha: Creator god holding staves that end in snake heads
 - Interior of Puma Punku complex has sunken court with stelae
	 - Probably where Gateway of the Sun came from originally
 - Complex directs rain runoff into a surrounding moat so platform becomes an island
