### The Maya
**Maya Region**:
 - Southern highlands, 300-3900 m asl with heavy vegetation
 - Peten: Southern lowlands, tropical rainforest, heavy rainfall
 - Yucatan: Northern lowlands, much drier, less rainfall, cenotes
**Chronology**:
 - Late Archaic Period: 2500-1200/1000 BCE
 - Formative (Preclassic) Period: 1200/1000 BCE - 250 CE
 - Classic Period: 250-900 CE
 - Postclassic Period: 900-1500 CE
**Subsistence**:
 - Sophisticated form of canal agriculture and swidden (milpa) farming
 - Aerial photos show extensive network of canals
	 - Large canals: 1.6 km long x 30 m wide x 3 m deep
**Wetland Farming**:
 - Constructed canals in swampland to provide drainage
 - Raised fields by piling up sediment above water level along lake edges or in swampy areas
	 - System dates to 1st millenium BCE
 - Rich environment: Fish, water-lilies, birds, insects, reptiles
 - Terraced slopes to trap soil from erosion, harvested forest fruit
 - 800 CE: 8-10 million people lived in the lowlands (possibly up to 15 million)
**Pre-Classic Maya**:
 - Dense forest cover makes it difficult to uncover early Maya origins
	 - This is changing with development of LiDAR
 - Maya are believed to have emerged at the same time as the Olmec, but in Belize + Guatemala
 - Cuello, Belize: 1200-400 BCE
	 - Small Maya ceremonial center
	 - Earliest platform may date to 1200 BCE
	 - Earliest specialized craft production, widespread trade
 - ~400 BCE: Emergence of Maya elite
	 - Earliest known burial of a ruler at K'o (350-300 BCE, near Tikal)
**Ceremonial Centers and E Groups**:
 - Middle Usumacinta Archaeological Project:
	 - Used LiDAR in northeastern Tabasco, Mexico
	 - Discovered dozens of unknown ceremonial centers
 - Largest site was Aguada Fenix (1200-800 BCE)
	 - Came out of nowhere, no evidence for already present large populations
		 - Existing populations came together and constructed giant monuments.
 - Massive N-S aligned artificial T-shaped platform with ramps, 20 mounds lining the exterior (calendar system), and an E-W oriented central E group
	 - Largest structure ever built in Mesoamerica: 1400m long, 400m wide
 - Similar pottery to south in Maya region
 - Similar layout to San Lorenzo and La Venta
**Nakbe**: (800-400 BCE)
 - Earliest large masonry public structures in Maya lowlands
 - Controlled by a powerful elite with symbols of later Maya kingship (jade inlaid teeth)
 - Stone pyramids with steep stairs
	 - Temples at top with elaborate stone carvings that were plastered and painted
	 - Included Maya god called Celestial Bird (associated with kingship)
**Mayan Mythology: San Bartolo Mural**:
 - Wall mural at San Bartolo in Guatemala
	 - Murals dated to 400-200 BCE (oldest Maya mural art)
 - Mural shows 9 mythological figures, including the maize god, part of Maya creation myth
	 - Life, death, renewal of the Maize god
 - Glyphs found with the mural are not deciphered
 - Possibly relate to myths known from the Gulf Coast
**El Mirador**: (300 BCE - 50 CE)
 - More water than Nakbe
 - More than 200 buildings
 - Some of earliest Maya writing on pot sherds
 - Stucco sculpture
	 - Stucco relief on La Danta pyramid show earliest images of Popol Vuh (Maya origin story)
 - Nakbe is connected to El Mirador by a causeway (12 km away)
 - Collapses suddenly, possibly due to warfare
**Early Mayan Kingship: Cerros** (50 BCE - 150 CE)
 - Located on Yucatan Peninsula
 - 50 year period:
	 - Originally settlement of farmers, fishermen, traders
	 - Shifted into an enormous ceremonial complex
 - Smashed pottery, destroyed early buildings
 - Built pyramids, temples, causeways, plazas with stucco images of gods and aspects of Mayan belief system, including ritual blood-letting
 - Then suddenly stopped and became a fishing village again

### Maya Cosmology
 - Complex and only partly understood
	 - Based on deciphering of Mayan writing (epigraphy) in 1980s and 1990s
	 - Much of this work done by Linda Schele and David Friedel
 - Maya Cosmos made up of 3 Otherworlds
	 - Underworld beneath us is watery world made up of 9 levels
		 - Includes worlds of gods, demons, and ancestors
	 - Middle world is the stony world we live in
		 - Floats in a great sea on the back of a crocodile-like animal (caiman) or on a turtle
	 - Upper world is the sky held up by 4 gods located at cardinal directions
		 - Starry arch of heaven has 13 levels with gods, supernatural beings
		 - Most important supernatural being is the crocodile (caiman) that sheds blood as rain
			 - Blood-letting is associated with rain, fertility, and water
 - 3 realms were linked together
	 - Other worlds determined fate of the living
	 - Beings of the otherworld must be nourished by the living
 - Kings/queens were divine shamans that operated in the otherworld through ritual performance
	 - Mostly blood-letting to keep both worlds in balance
 - Shamanic practices also involved a lot of hallucinogenic drugs
