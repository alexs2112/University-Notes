### Gift of the Nile
 - Ancient Egypt developed in the Nile river floodplain
	 - The Nile is the longest river in the world (6600 km)
	 - Two major tributaries: the *Blue Nile* (Lake Tana, Ethiopian highlands) and the *White Nile* (Lake Victoria)
	 - The Nile flows north to its delta at the Mediterranean Sea
 - Annual floods provided rich alluvium each year
	 - Floods were more predictable than in Mesopotamia
 - Nile personified by the god Hapi
**Geography**:
 - Ancient Egypt is the first state of its size in history, a territorial state
 - Long and narrow oasis surrounded by desert
 - Isolated Egypt from tropical Africa and Near East
	 - Although traded for gold, ivory, semi-precious stone, timber from Levant and tropical Africa
 - Travel along the Nile by boat is ancient
	 - Earliest image of boat that resembles predynastic boats is carved onto a pebble in a securely dated site (~7000 BCE, near Khartoum)
 - Ancient Egyptians called their land **"Kemet" (Black Land)**
	 - Black fertile soils of the floodplain
	 - **"Deshret" (Red Land)** is the dry desert sands
**2 Geopolitical Areas**
 - Egypt is divided into 2 geopolitical areas:
	 - **Lower Egypt** is the Nile river delta (*ta-mehu* - land of the papyrus)
	 - **Upper Egypt** is the area south of the delta to Nubia (*ta-shema* - land of the shema reed)
 - Unification of Upper and Lower Egypt is represented in the combined crowns
	 - White domed crown of Upper Egypt (*hedjet*)
	 - Red curled crown of Lower Egypt (*deshret*)
	 - Combined crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt (*sekhemti*)

### Ancient Egypt: Outline
 - Neolithic/Chalcolithic or Pre-dynastic Period (5000-3100 BCE)
 - Archaic or Early Dynastic Period (3100-2700 BCE)
 - Dynastic Period (2700-1070 BCE)
	 - Old Kingdom (2700-2140 BCE)
	 - First Intermediate (2140-2040 BCE)
	 - Middle Kingdom (2040-1640 BCE)
	 - Second Intermediate (1640-1550 BCE)
	 - New Kingdom (1550-1070 BCE)
	 - Third Intermediate/Decline (1100 BCE)
 - **Kingdoms**: State is under a centralized authority (king or pharaoh) ruling from a capital city
 - **Intermediates**: Periods where power became decentralized, held by local authorities (nomarchs)

# Pre-Dynastic
 - Neolithic / Chalcolithic (5000-3100 BCE)
 - After 5000 BCE, simple farming based on cattle and cereal farming develops in Nile River floodplain
	 - Using Near Eastern crops
 - Villages located on the edge of the floodplain
 - Farmers planted crops as the flood receded, or grazed animals on the floodplain
 - Harvested crops before the next flood
 - Copper using groups (possibly using copper ore for paint)
**Lower Egypt**:
 - By 4000 BCE, evidence of social differences in burials
	 - Chiefs buried with a staff that is pointed at one end and flat at the other end
 - Most people are buried in simple pit burials within settlements
 - By 3500 BCE, large towns had their own gods and local rulers
	 - one of these communities is Buto (modern Cairo)
 - *Maadian Culture*: Traded with Upper Egypt, Levant, Mesopotamia
	 - Undecorated pottery, used donkey caravans to trade with Near Eastern sources
**Upper Egypt**:
- Earliest farming society is the Badarian culture (wheat, barley, lentils, cattle, goats, sheep, fish)
- Developed in the Eastern and Western Desert
- Mainly known from burials, individuals buried in pits facing west in desert cemeteries with pots, beads, palettes
- Traded with Sinai and Eastern Desert
- Produced fine pottery called black topped red ware and faience (craft specialists)
- Earliest evidence of intentional mummification (4300 BCE) from resins on linens
**Earliest Direct Evidence of Embalming**: (UE)
 - First discovered linens with resins that dated to 4500 BCE reported in 2014
 - It has been assumed that most pre-dynastic mummification is natural
 - New study of a mummy (3700-3500 BCE) is the first direct evidence for an embalmed individual
 - Recipe of plant oil, heated conifer resin, both aromatic plant extract and plant gum/sugar that are antibacterial agents
 - These recipes are similar to those used 2500 years later by Egyptian embalmers of the New Kingdom and in the linens from 4500 BCE
**Developing Complex Technology: Egyptian Faience**: (UE)
 - Not invented in Egypt on its own, but used
 - Made of crushed quartz or sand crystals mixed with sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper oxides that produce blue, green, or turqoise colour
	 - Faience paste was shaped in molds and fired in a kiln (1000 C)
	 - Calcium silicates in the paste produced a glass surface
 - Objects were also dipped into faience powder or painted with a slurry of the paste, fired, and produced the glassy surface
 - Possibly intended to imitate turquoise and other gems
 - Earliest workshop at Abydos: 5500 BE
 - Ancient Egyptians believed that the reflection of light off these pieces was the light of immortality
**Bearded Men**: (UE)
 - New form of sculpture in the pre-dynastic period
 - Beard may be a symbol of power, precursor for false beards of Pharaohs
	 - eg: males are not identified with primary sexual characteristics but ones related to power

### Urbanism in Upper Egypt
 - 3 important cities from 3600 BCE
	 - Naqada

 - About this time, material culture of Upper Egypt spreads into Lower Egypt
	 - Maadi culture disappears
**Nekhen - City of the Falcon Diety**:
 - Was a very prosperous center
	 - Main businesses were brewing beer and pottery-making
 - Large beer brewing installations are estimated to have produced 300 gallons or more of beer per day
 - Pottery-making was also important

**Ceremonial Complex**:
 - Nekhen is the cradle of Egyptian kingship
 - Cult of the falcon deity

**Animal Burials: the Earliest Zoo** (3600 BCE):
 - Located on the edge of the elite cemetery in Nekhen
 - Tombs of exotic animals buried whole (baboons, elephants, leopards, crocodiles, hippos, dogs, cats, auroch)
 - Sacrifice wild animals to symbolize control of ruler over the chaos of nature
 - Animals were powerful
	 - Often animal form taken by gods and early rulers
 - Zoos demonstrate ruler's wealth and power
	 - Legitimize pharaohs up to the New Kingdom period
**Nekhen: Elite Tomb 100**

		 - Kings upheld order, justice, piety, defeated the forces of chaos
