### Mesopotamia
 - Alluvial plain between Tigris and Euphrates rivers
	 - Greek: Land between the two rivers
 - Fertile Crescent: States preceded by the origins of agriculture about 10kya (Neolithic)
 - Near Eastern domesticates: Wheat, barley, dates, lentils, olives, oranges, onions, cattle, goats, sheep, pigs
**Greater Mesopotamia**:
 - **Northern Plain**:  Foothills of the Taurus and Zagros mountains
	 - Enough rain in the winter to grow crops without irrigation (dry farming)
 - **Southern Plain**: Akkad and Sumer, flat alluvial plain requires irrigation to grow crops (little rain)
 - New alluvium deposited by rivers each year
	 - Rich soils can produce enough food to feed dense populations with irrigation
 - Floodplain is rich source of clay, palm trees, reeds, natural bitumen

### Before City States
**Wittfogel/Steward's Hydraulic State Model**:
 - Organization of irrigation led to development of Mesopotamian city states (voluntary model)
 - People needed irrigation to farm on the floodplain
 - People submit themselves voluntarily to a central authority
	 - Organizes construction/maintenance of canals and distribution of water
 - Authority controls water, eventually usurp power and surplus wealth
	 - Eventually become despotic rulers
**Early Settlements on the Floodplain**:
 - Scrub areas and marshlands in southern floodplain supported hunter-gatherer populations
 - Farmers began to settle along the rivers
	 - Earliest settlements now buried under silt
 - Arrived with pottery and copper technology
	 - Obtained copper ore and obsidian from Anatolia
**Phases of Development on Floodplains**: 6500-4200 BC
 - Halaf, Hassuna, Samarra, Ubaid phases/period
 - Generally develop in a time series, there is overlap in time and space
 - Shift from simple mud-houses in northern plain to farmers gradually moving into southern plain
	 - Initiating irrigation with increasing participation in trade
**Halafian Phase**: 6100-5100 BCE
 - Foothills/uplands northern Iraq and Syria
 - Rain-fed farming (no irrigation)
 - Archaeology in the late 1980s show that the Halaf culture develops from indigenous groups in the region
 - Eventually, Halafian culture appears to have adopted Ubaid culture from southern plain around 5000 BCE
**Hassuna Phase**: ~6500 BCE
 - First farmers in northern plain
 - Moved from mountains into foothills of northern Mesopotamia
	 - Gradually began to settle river valleys on plains
 - Used some irrigation
 - Built mud-walled buildings with open courtyards
**Samarra Phase**: 6500-5900 BCE
 - Chalcolithic culture (copper age)
 - *Chogo Mami* site has earliest evidence of irrigation (~4600 BCE)
	 - Irrigation spread rapidly
 - *Tell es-Sawwan*: Multi-roomed mud-brick buildings surrounded by *fortified walls*, T-shaped buildings, possibly for grain storage and rich burials
 - Samarra pottery style is first uniform style traded widely
**Ubaid Phase**: 6000-4200 BCE
 - Lays the foundation for Mesopotamian civilizations
 - First farmers settle the southern plain and establish villages
 - Beginning of temple institution, expansion of irrigation agriculture

### Ubaid
**Ubaid 0**:
 - This is the initial phase, overlaps with the Samarra
	 - Phase system didn't originally start at 0, they discovered this site after the phase system was established (and originally started at 1)
 - Currently: Earliest known village in southern plain is *Oueili* (6000 BCE)
 - Located near marshlands (fish, reeds)
 - Oueili farmers relied on irrigation
**Eridu**: According to Sumerian creation story, Eridu was first settlement to rise form primordial sea
 - After ~4500 BCE, rapid development of urbanization (2-tiered)
	 - Based in irrigation, plough farming
 - These settlements were unwalled
 - Ubaid culture spreads rapidly from Eridu to the northern plain and around Persian Gulf coast to Oman (copper source)
 - Sailing was known at this time
 - Early forms of **temple structures** built of mud-brick with niches, buttresses, altars, raised on mud-brick platforms
 - Between 5000-3000 BCE, temples became center of Ubaid settlements
 - Eridu's patron god was Ea, who was credited with founding Eridu and civilization
 - **Eridu Temple**: Built in many phases with each phase being larger, higher, with more buildings
	 - Elaborate residences for priests/priestesses located around temple
**Temple Institution**:
 - Temples and religion were focus of Ubaid society
 - Temple housed patron gods and religious authority
 - Temple organized irrigation, water allocation, and trade (storage facilities)
 - Temples were large land-holders and employers
**Temple Authority: Priests and Priestesses**
 - Early temple officials had limited influence
 - As settlements grew, authorities became more powerful
 - Temples allocate water rights, powerful on the floodplain
	 - Religious role was also powerful
 - Temples produced, and also received, surplus to obtain luxury items to reinforce status
**Long-Distance Exchange**
 - Ubaid settlements produced agricultural surplus and pottery
 - Traded for stone, timber, copper, precious stones in uplands to east & along Persian Gulf coast to south
 - Ubaid pottery spread rapidly north and south
**What was Ubaid Society Like**
 - Most settlements were self-sufficient in the needs of daily life (pottery, food, production, cloth production, storage)
	 - Fired clay agricultural tools
 - Evidence of some groups with more wealth than others, but not lavish
	 - Some had painted pots, better food, and architecture
 - Differences in status between temple and common people emerging
