### Early Dynastic Period
 - Beginning of historical period
	 - Written records extend beyond economic administration: king-lists, literature, poetry
 - Great age of southern Sumerian city states
 - Southern plain divided into Sumer in the south, Akkad in the north

### Nature of Sumerian Civilization
 - Cosmopolitan population, multi-ethnic, many different languages
 - Major ethnic group was Sumerians, possibly ancestors occupied marshes
	 - Ancestors of Marsh Arabs
 - All groups shared common culture, writing system, pantheon of gods
 - Sumerian was ancient language of southern Mesopotamia
	 - No surviving modern day equivalent to Sumerian language
	 - Phased out around 1800 BCE
 - Northern Mesopotamia were Semitic speakers
**Control of Nippur**:
 - Most important religious center in Mesopotamia
 - Essential for political control
 - Nippur is home of the god Enlil (god of the gods)
 - God-world mirrors living world
**Sumerian City-States**:
 - Defensive brick wall, central temple and palace architecture
	 - Rest divided into neighbourhoods (partly by occupation)
 - Cities often faced onto river (habour or quay)
 - Houses were mud-brick, multi-storied, central courtyard, possibly markets (no evidence)
 - As cities increased in size - rural settlements declined (and vice versa)
**Sumerian Rulers**:
 - About 20 Sumerian city states
 - Rulers now were hereditary dynasties, temples were still important
 - Not divine kings

### Sumer
 - Ur was one of these city states
	 - Importance shift from the city of Uruk to city of Ur
 - Sumer was linked to other polities through trade
	 - Near East, Indus Valley, Levant, Anatolia, Nile Valley
 - Trade expands with increased demand for luxury goods as society becomes more hierarchical
 - Includes expansion of maritime trade
**Trade**:
 - Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan
 - Obsidian, chert from Anatolia (Turkey)
 - Lead, gold, silver from Anatolia
 - Persian Gulf: Copper, pearls
 - Southern Arabia: Steatite, diorite, copper
 - Indus: Carnelian

### Technology and Economy
 - Agriculture was biggest industry, some settlements along river had large scale grain parching and storage facilities
 - These settlements were founded intentionally by the state as part of state-organized control of grain supply
	 - Settlement hierarchy partly planned by state, not organic development
 - Textiles were second industry
	 - Images of women weaving fabrics (wool, linen) and possibly carpets
 - Pottery trade declines, possibly with rise in use of metal and stone vessels

### Bronze Age
 - Bronze metallurgy was introduced in this period
 - Alloy of copper and tin, bronze tools are stronger and durable
 - Improved agricultural production and warfare
 - Bronze weaponry and wheeled vehicles revolutionize warfare
 - Carts pulled by donkey or oxen
**Bronze**:
 - Metal was heavy, likely smelted elsewhere and imported as ingots
 - Expansion of metallurgy overall (gold, silver, copper, bronze)
 - Bronze case in molten form creates a truer blade edge, harder than copper

### Sumerian Texts
 - Cuneiform texts in Sumerian and later Akkadian
 - **King-list**: List of ruling cities and kings in 2 broad periods
	 - Before and after the great flood
 - Several versions of the Great Flood in the Near East in the 3rd to 2nd millenia BCE
 - King-list shows concept of unified kingships
	 - One city was ruling dynasty, over others in a hierarchy
 - Constantly shifting power between city states
	 - Kish was struck down by Gilgamesh, king of Uruk
**Utnapishtim and the Great Flood**:
 - Sumerian version of Noah in the Epic of Gilgamesh
 - Gods of Shuruppak decided to get rid of people (too noisy)
 - Utnapishtim was warned by god Ea (created humans) and was told to build an ark for himself, his family, and other living creatures
 - The flood comes and kills everyone and everything, except those on the ark
 - When gods discovered that Utnapishtim survived they were angry, but then relieved that he had saved animals and humanity
	 - Gods grant Utnapishtim and his wife immortality to be spent in paradise
 - Gods then restored kingship and civilization with a dynasty at Kish
	 - One of its kings was Enmegaragesi, historic king dated to 2600 BCE
**Epic of Gilgamesh**:
 - Gilgamesh was a historic king of Uruk (2600 BCE), considered part god and part human
	 - The epic also describes the city of Uruk
 - He was a young king who exploited his people building his great city and its walls
	 - His people appealed for help from the sky god Anu
 - Anu creates a wild man called Enkidu in the forest who eventually goes to Uruk and meets Gilgamesh
 - After a good fight, the two become best friends and have many adventures
 - One adventure: Gilgamesh rejects the amorous advances of the goddess Innana, seeks her revenge by killing Enki**du
	 - Gilgamesh realizes his own mortality, Enkidu reveals to him that the afterlife is a horrible place, sets out to find immortality
 - Goes to Utnapishtim, fails every test, then told to accept mortal life and appreciate what he has
