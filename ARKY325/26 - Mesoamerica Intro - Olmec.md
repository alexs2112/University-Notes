### Mesoamerica
 - 2 major cultural areas:
	 - The Central Highlands (including Oaxaca & the Valley of Mexico)
	 - The Maya area (plus the Gulf Coast)
 - Great environmental diversity
	 - Resources needed by everyone were confined to restricted areas
	 - No area was self-sufficient, trade and exchange were always very important
 - Important resources:
	 - Knapping stone: Obsidian, some chert
	 - Grinding stones: Basalt
	 - Semi-precious stone: Jade, Turquoise, etc
	 - Metals (in post-Classic times)
	 - Textiles
	 - Ritual: Incense, feathers, stingray spines
	 - Salt
**Agriculture**:
 - Major domesticates:
	 - American Triumvirate: Domesticated maize, beans, and squash
	 - Provides a complete protein diet
	 - Domesticated in the Formative period (American Neolithic) between 10-7 kya
 - 4 centers for agricultural base:
	 - Mesoamerica
	 - Highland South America
	 - Eastern North America
	 - Amazon Basin
 - Origins in Mesoamerica:
	 - R.S. MacNeish (1960s)
	 - Tehuacan Valley Project to study plant domestication in Mesoamerica
		 - Puebla, Mexican Highlands, an ecologically varied area
**Tehuacan Valley**:
 - 450 sites, 12 are deeply stratified, containing dry caves (preserved) & open air sites
	 - From 10k BCE to 1500 CE, dated by radiocarbon dates
 - 10k plant remains, 11k animal remains
	 - Diet composed of meat, wild vegetables, cultivated plants
**Rise of Complexity**:
 - Develops in several different places
	 - Valley of Mexico
	 - Gulf Coast
	 - Mayan lowlands
	 - Oaxaca Valley
	 - Soconusco (Pacific Coast)
 - Vastly different environments, civilizations linked in trade and exchange of ideas

### Gulf Coast: The Olmec
 - 2 major centers:
	 - San Lorenzo: (1150-800 BCE)
	 - La Venta: (900-400 BCE)
**Mesoamerican State Characterization**:
 - Rituals, blood sacrifice (stingray/other fish spines and seashells)
 - Stepped pyramids with other monuments (ball courts, temples, stelae)
 - Calendar and writing systems
 - Styles of dress
 - Market economy
 - Development of these civilizations occur simultaneously in these areas through trade and other interactions
**Pre-Classic Gulf Coast: Olmec 1500-400 BCE**:
 - Olmec means "rubber people", a name that comes from the Aztecs
 - Rich uplands, estuaries, floodplains
	 - Rivers flood annually, depositing alluvium for agriculture
 - Fish, crocodiles, toads, birds, domesticated dogs
 - Maize, beans, squash, manioc, chili peppers, sunflower, beans, chocolate
**Olmec**:
 - Origin of the Olmec is unclear
	 - Likely local lineages held land, some had more land than others and became powerful
	 - Built locations to express power in ritual performances
 - Elite interaction evident in exchange between highlands and gulf coast
	 - Trade consisting of obsidian, jade, magnetite, shell, stingray spines, shark teeth
	 - Also exchange of symbols, architecture, and rituals
 - Not a state but a series of chiefdoms
 - Olmec were involved in trade well beyond Olmec heartland
	 - Trade resulted in widespread sharing of art motifs, religious symbols, ritual practices & concepts of kingship
	 - Olmec is a catalyst for the movement of these ideas (but ideas developing in many places)
 - Also constructed monumental platforms
	 - Pyramids
	 - Basalt carvings of statues, altars, stelae
	 - Developed symbolism of kingship
