# Initial Period (1800-800 BCE)
### Highlands
**Chavin de Huantar**: (1500-500 BCE)
 - Northern Andean highlands in Peru
 - Controlled trade routes to coast and Amazon Basin
	 - Religious ideas spread along those trade routes
 - Once thought to be the "mother culture" of Andean civilizations
	 - Now thought to have been a religious cult with influence over northern-central highlands and coastal areas
 - Produced commercial ceramics
 - Imagery not invented by Chavin
	 - Drawn from earlier imagery & cultures in highlands and Amazon basin
	 - Imagery found on ceramics, jewelry, religious architecture
 - 1200-500 BCE becomes an important pilgrimage center and production center of ritual objects
	 - Objects include those made with pink spondylus shell traded from Ecuador's coast
 - Village built on river banks near monuments (2-3000 people)
 - Monumental construction (stone masonry platforms) built between 1200-800 BCE
	 - Buildings stopped 800 BCE, site still very active ritually
 - Burials indicate social differences
 - Earthquake in 500 BCE collapses buildings, center is no longer used
 - Old Temple at Chavin has U-shaped platform opening to the east (sunrise and forest)
	 - Represents an artificial mountain
 - Designed for rituals about:
	 - Circulation of water
	 - Use of hallucinogenic drugs
	 - Possibly spondylus shell horns
 - Inside U is a sunken circular plaza with stone staircase leading to a series of rooms
	 - Inside the lower room is a cross-shaped chamber that houses a carved white granite statue
**The Lanzon**:
 - Large lance-shaped stone, 4.5 m high, called the Great Image or Lanzon
 - Image of human wearing ear-spools, necklace, belt of serpent-jaguar figures, feline teeth and nostrils, snakes for hair
 - Symbolic axis joining the underworld and heavens
 - Small place in walls near top of Lanzon
	 - Hiding place, so Lanzon appeared to "talk"
 - Powerful sensory impact of the site (psychoactive drugs)
**Chavin Cult**:
 - Iconography shared by groups in north-central highlands
	 - Animal elements with Amazonian origins
	 - Images of intertwined elements: people, snakes, jaguars, caymans, tropical birds
 - Part of rituals in shrines
	 - Shaman transforming into other beings using hallucinogenic drugs
 - Note: Image of "staff god" (feline elements, hair of snakes) found in many Andean religions
**Chavin Horizon**:
 - Horizon is the spread of ideas over a broad area
 - Chavin cult was spread by pilgrims participating in rituals at Chavin, taking these ideas home
 - Incorporates motifs from the Amazon basin
	 - Possibly from movement of shaman-leaders from this area
 - Chavin materials spread across the highlands and coastal areas
	 - Textiles, silver-gold alloy objects, imagery
**Paracas Culture**: (800-100 BCE)
 - Southern highlands, small states or ceremonial centers appear around Lake Titicaca with platform mounds, as well as along the southern coast
 - Coastal example: Paracas culture
	 - Smaller coastal populations
	 - Fine embroidered textiles with designs inspired by the Chavin
	 - Ceramics, textile making introduced from Titicaca region to the coast
**Paracas Necropolis**:
 - 400 mummies placed in baskets
	 - Wealthy individuals
	 - Tied in flexed or seated position
	 - Wrapped in beautiful cloth of woven alpaca wool and cotton
	 - Set upright in baskets with rich clothing, elaborate gold and copper work
	 - Burial package wrapped up in plain cotton placed in underground crypt
 - Many underwent trephination or trepanation surgery
	 - Cranial deformation also performed
	 - These happened multiple times and the individuals survived
	 - Likely religious, not medical
 - Dry conditions preserved more textiles here than any other site
	 - Image on textiles called "Ecstatic Shaman"
		 - Human with head back, flowing hair, bent backward, arms over head
		 - Shaman in ecstatic drug-induced trance
 - Inka stated that shaman and sorcerers had unbound long hair
**Summary**:
 - 2000 years ago, several Andean "kingdoms" share in elements of same art style, architecture, other material forms
 - Intensive trade results in intensive interaction
	 - Sharing ideologies and religious beliefs, possibly ideas about elite authority

# Andean States (200 BCE - 1534 CE)
### Early Intermediate Period
 - 200 BCE - 600 CE, Classical Period
 - Andean civilizations developing in both directions
	 - Moche in north, Nazca in south
 - Stop constructing U-shaped shrines
 - New religion/ideology emerges of divine authority
 - Population rose from a few hundred thousand to 4-5 million during the Classic period
**Complex Societies**:
 - Rulers are believed to be semi-divine, rule by divine right (not as shaman-priests)
 - Peak in development of architecture, art, metallurgy
	 - Warfare is an ongoing theme
 - Many large cities are supported by complex trade & irrigation agriculture
 - Small city states with their own distinct pottery traditions
**North Coast: Moche Civilization**: (100-700 CE)
 - Individual kingdoms in different river valleys
	 - Relied on maritime resources and irrigation agriculture
	 - Populations were increasing, differences in wealth emerged
 - Competition over limited arable land
	 - Military/ritual rulers conquer neighbours, take their surplus as tribute
 - States emerge controlling several river watersheds from large primary centers
 - Moche was never a unified state over all of the valleys
 - Art style emerges 200 CE
 - Moche society controlled by different elites
	 - Several strategies of control:
		 - Military force and conquest to control other valleys, keep other groups out
		 - Strategic political marriages to create alliances
		 - Economic power building irrigation systems, long-distance trade routes, food storage
	 - Powerful ideology, public performance, ceremonial regalia of divine kingship
		 - Links ruler with forces of nature & supernatural world
 - Constructed elaborate canals to transport water into desert lands for maize
	 - No large storage facilities found
	 - Canals required enormous labour force to construct/maintain
 - Eventually linked irrigation systems of different valleys using canals
	 - Likely provided by mit'a tax
**Cerro Blanco in Moche Valley**:
 - 2 large adobe pyramids called huacas (40m tall)
 - Huacas made from sun-dried mud brick (adobe)
 - Brightly painted murals with molded adobe images on walls
**Adobe Bricks**:
 - Maker's marks may represent mit'a tax provided by different kin groups
	 - Kin groups later called *Ayllus*
	 - More than 100 different signs on the bricks
 - Bricks bearing same sign cluster in segments of structures
	 - Interpreted as sections constructed by work parties from same social groups
