	 - Inka ruler was representative of Inti on earth
 - Inti gave Inka divine edicts:
	 - Transform Cuzco into navel of universe
	 - Conquer others and spread civilization
**Society at Time of State Formation**:
 - Small scale farming societies around Cuzco
 - Small villages organized into kin groups called ayllus
	 - Ayllus held land in common
	 - Ayllu leaders reciprocate labour to one another to distribute resources
 - Early Inka war leaders were likely petty war leaders called sinchi
	 - Sinchi were elected officials who were measured by success in warfare
**Sapa Inka**:
 - ~1410: Sinchi called Viracocha Inka came to power
	 - Claimed to be a living god, descendent of the sun-god Inti
 - New religious cult worshipping sun-god Inti emerges
	 - Ruler of state now called Sapa Inka
	 - Ruler married his full-blooded sister in order to produce heir that descends from Inti
**Pachacuti**:
