### Origins of the Chinese State
 - 2500 BCE: Large urban centers existed in may parts of China (found in recent surveys)
 - Emergence of the Chinese style of architecture, art, ideology, writing, cuisine
 - Hierarchical society with marked social differences
 - Longshan followed by Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties between 2000-250 BCE (Three Dynasties)
	 - Known from archaeology/some historic documentation
 - None unify the large number of competing states in China
	 - This happens under Qin, much later

### Xia State
 - 2070-1600 BCE (poorly understood)
 - Founded by Yu the Great
 - Exact location and time of Xia state is unclear
 - Histories written during the Han dynasty pieced together the history of early states, some confusion
 - No evidence for the Xia dynasty (nor of the Shang conquering the Xia) in Shang oracle texts
 - Xia sites cannot be distinguished from Shang based on material culture
	 - Many believe it is mythical
	 - If real, then it was located in Huanghe Valley with its capital at Erlitou
**Erlitou**:
 - True city (20k people)
 - Similar to other cities of this period, different from Longshan centers
	 - These were elite centers with palace enclosures surrounded by clusters of low-status villages and workshops
	 - Long-distance exchange for precious metals
	 - Bronze is restricted to these centers
	 - Centers are found over wider area of China
 - Focus of the state was on ritual and warfare
 - Has 2 rectangular palaces built of rammed earth (walls and platform)
	 - Interior space is laid out in highly regulated pattern oriented on the cardinal directions
 - Human sacrifices (one from hands bound behind back) are buried in the foundations
 - Bronze and turquoise workshops under elite control inside the complex
	 - Bronzes, turquoise, jades were all items of political power
	 - High degree of social stratification
 - Suddenly declines

### Shang Dynasty: 1600-1046 BCE
 - Develops in the north in the same area as the Yangshao
 - First documented Chinese state (written records)
 - 7 capitals in middle Huanghe River valley, all have the same layout
 - China's first urban civilization
 - 1st capital at Ao
	 - Buried under modern Zhengzhou
 - There is archaeology of the royal compound and 33' tall town wall (10m)
**Anyang (Yin)**:
 - Large ceremonial and administrative center with royal residences, meeting halls, temples built on rammed earth platforms
 - Elite/noble houses & large buildings are surrounded by burials of animals, chariots, human sacrifices, pits of oracle bones
 - Palace is 60m long
 - Surrounded by craft workshops and pit house residences of commoners
	 - Workshops of bronze, bone, and pottery
	 - Bone pins and tools of animal and human bone
**Palace-Temple Complex**:
 - Multiple palace temple complexes near Anyang (different kings shifted residences)
 - Huanbei:
	 - Intentionally burned down by its ruler after less than 50 years
	 - Rammed earth wall around the complex, inside is the palace complex (2 parts)
	 - 60 buildings, lots of human sacrifices
	 - Main one is largest building of its time in china (palace/temple)
		 - No more than 3 stories
	 - Buildings are aligned 13 degrees east of north
**Ritual Center at Xaiotun near Anyang**:
 - Ritual complex about 1 hectare in area that was part palace and part temple
 - Timber-frame buildings with wattle and daub walls, thatched roofs
 - Shang rulers were ritual specialists and intermediaries between ancestors, gods, and their subjects (priest-kings)
 - Most oracle bones came from this site
	 - Bones found in caches or archives
	 - A place of regular divination
 - Large numbers of human sacrifices in these foundations
**Anyang Royal Burials**:
 - 1200 graces, most are small
 - 11 large graves required an enormous amount of labour to build
	 - 8 of these have a cruciform plan with ramps covered in human sacrifices
		 - Looted in antiquity
	 - Central wood structure for main burial (red & black lacquer)
 - Bronze vessels and other bronze objects, shell, bone, stone objects including jade and sculptures, placed with the dead
 - Royal tombs also surrounded by animal sacrifices
 - Up to 400 human sacrifices in these graves
 - 13k sacrifices in 200 year period, all decapitated
 - 11 of the burials fit well with the 11 Shang kings recorded as having ruled Anyang (last one was burned by Zhou)
	 - Recently, more large burials found at another site called Xibeigang
	 - Possible that these others are queens tombs, unclear
