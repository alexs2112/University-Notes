### Background
 - Prior to 3rd millenium BCE, most complex cultural developments occurred within southern Mesopotamia at sites such as Ur and Uruk
 - Broaden geographical understanding of Near East to include regions such as Anatolia (Turkey) and the Levant (large area in Eastern Mediterranean)
	 - Anatolia: Gobekli Tepe, Catalhoyuk
	 - Levant: Tell es-Sultan/Jericho, Tell Aswad, Ain Ghazal
 - Neolithic and Chalcolithic occupations are mainly modest-sized farming villages
 - This ends during Early Bronze Age and the appearance of the first kingdoms and empires
**Empires**:
 - Defined as large-scale political entities that bring a diverse group of societies under a single ruler
 - Characteristics:
	 - Vastly larger than states, lack permanent or fixed boundaries
	 - Conquered states and their territories to become provinces
		 - Retain some cultural identity, even some political autonomy
	 - Deliver tribute to imperial heartland and retain allegiance
 - Early Bronze Age empires in the Near East: (3rd Millenium BCE)
	 - Akkadian Empire under King Sargon I
	 - Third Dynasty of Ur (Sumerian Renaissance)
	 - Elam (southwest Iran)
 - 2nd Millennium BCE:
	 - Centralized state authority
	 - Expansion and decline of long-distance trade networks
 - 1st Millenium BCE, formation of great empires:
	 - Assyrians
	 - Neo-Babylonians
	 - Persians
