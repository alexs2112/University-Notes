### 1. V. Gordon Childe: The Urban Revolution
 - Viewed culture change as revolutions (urban revolution)
	 - Neolithic revolution (from Paleolithic): Shift from hunter-gathering to settled agricultural base
 - Characterized by invention of metallurgy, emergence of full-time specialists
 - Lived in cities, supported by food from the hinterlands
 - Craft resources obtained by traders through long-distance trade
 - Economic specialization of workforce
	 -> Steady pressure to intensify food production
	 -> Invention of new technologies (irrigation)
 - Central authority controls politics and economy
	 - Uses writing/bureaucracy to document taxes, tribute, organize trade
 - Result: Class-based society less reliant on kinship or unified by religious ideology
 - Rulers were despots/priest kings who built monuments to show their authority
**Problems**:
 - Craft specialization more a result than cause of the rise of states
 - Production of surplus in state formation does not tell us why/how surplus production developed in the first place
	 - Or why people started to live in cities

### 2. What Caused Surplus: Irrigation Theories
 - Most early states emerge in dry river valleys
 - James Henry Breasted suggested that the exceptional fertility of the Nile and the Euphrates floodplains was primary cause of rise of states in these valleys
 - Floods provided  new silt/water each year
	 - Produced surplus that led to exchange, wealth and the support of specialists
**Hydraulic States: Irrigation more than Surplus**:
 - Karl Wittfogel's hydraulic state theory (irrigation leads to central authority)
 - Life in dry river valleys requires the development of a group to organize irrigation and to redistribute surplus production
 - People submit themselves to this authority voluntarily
 - Authority eventually controls other activities (trade)
 - Authority controls water distribution, can distribute more water to its own fields
	 - Generates surplus to obtain prestige goods
 - Authority eventually becomes corrupt
 - More recent studies show that Egypt/Mesopotamian communities started irrigation from natural collection basins with small canals to their fields
	 - Controlled their own irrigation long before state control
**Current Thoughts on Irrigation**:
 - Irrigation is important to many state structures
 - It took several centuries before rulers took over farmers' canal systems, built greater irrigation networks
 - Also irrigation systems found in wet conditions, not just dry ones
	 - Subak systems in Bali, Indonesia is integrated into the religious and political system
		 - Controlled by Balinese temples to serve farming collectives that manage/maintain system

### 3. Technology and Trade Stimulate States
 - Others argue that the need to trade for raw materials and other goods stimulated long-distance exchange
 - Opportunity for emergent elite to accumulate exotic materials to build prestige and unequal levels of wealth (prestige goods economy)
 - Evidence of many chiefdoms that participated in exchange of prestige goods and shared ideologies to create regional and local influence (interaction spheres)
	 - We see this in burials between different time periods (exotic grave goods)

### 4. Warfare: Carneiro's Environmental Circumscription Model
 - If fertile farmland is bordered by desert, mountains, ocean, then it is circumscribed (farmland is limited)
	 - Farmers settle on the floodplain/fertile lands until all land is taken up
 - Population keeps increasing and puts pressure on food resources
	 - Only option is to take other people's land
 - One group takes neighbour's land by force until all of the land is under one leader
	 - Circumscription -> people have nowhere to run
 - As each group is conquered, moves into the bottom of the hierarchy (gels into classes)
 - Ruler serves purpose of increasing agricultural production by taking more land or developing technologies for intensive agriculture (irrigation)
**Problems**:
 - Not all states emerge in circumscribed environments
 - States engage in warfare, unclear if warfare is "cause" of state formation
	 - Certainly contributes to empire building
 - Urban centers often develop around shrines, powers of place can attract settlers

### Current Ideas on State Origins
 - Lots of theories, but single causes and universal models are generally discarded
 - Previous models all have elements that are found in many states: irrigation, warfare, trade
	 - No single push
 - Most archaeologists now view states as developing gradually over time and from multiple causes

### Social Theories with Multiple Factors
 - Power needs to be created at every level of society
	 - States are fragile and need a lot of management
 - **Economic Power**: Ability to create specialized workforce, organize surplus storage, distribute (include trade for prestige goods)
 - **Social Power**: Requires development of an ideology of social relations and an understanding of the world that bonds a group of unrelated people
 - **Political Power**: Tied into social and religious ideology represented in symbols, architecture, art that legitimates social inequality and the right of priests/rulers to surplus production and prestige

### Performance and Monumental Architecture
 - **Core of Cities**: Temples, pyramids, plazas for elaborate ceremonies where ideologies were enacted
 - Religious/secular rulers perform rituals in these settings to show that they were the rightful keepers of the cosmic order
 - Had right to surplus wealth, power, prestige

### Political Power
 - Ideology, symbols, architecture, performance
 - Ability to impose authority through administration and military who are not their kin
 - Had to provide spiritual, economic, and physical security for those they governed
 - Needed to be successful in war and diplomacy
 - States were hard to maintain

### Internal Structure of States
 - Research tends to focus on occupational hierarchy as social difference
 - States and empires were ethnically diverse
	 - Created different factions in society
 - Different groups introduced new ideas, technologies, religions, political ideas
 - Sometimes factions seized opportunities to overthrow the state

### Concept of Cycling States
 - Explains how internal differences and external competition cause states to rise and fall
 - New larger polities can develop from state collapse
	 - An introduce new ways of administration, new ideologies and technology
	 - Can lead to collapse and a breaking-down into many new competing states that are economically more sustainable
 - Collapse can result in opportunities

### Collapse and Sustainability
 - States require enormous organization and resources, unlike any other type of society
	 - States tend to be fragile
 - No single factor causes states to rise or fall
 - Multiple factors lead to collapse:
	 - Environmental disasters or plagues
	 - Impact of state on its environment (stress resources)
	 - Weak rulers or rulers who fail to control the forces of the cosmos
	 - Warfare
	 - Civil war
