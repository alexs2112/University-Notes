### Case Study: Pompeii
 - Considered one of the best-preserved archaeological sites in the world due to volcanic eruption
 - Pompeii and Herculaneum were Roman towns near present-day Naples
	 - Campania region of SW Italy
 - Both towns were completely destroyed and buried under 4-6m of volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE
 - Some evidence of post-eruption disturbance and looting
	 - Possibly by residents who escaped the eruption, or by people far afterwards
 - Further eruptions in 5th and 6th centuries CE further covered the remains
	 - Largely forgotten until 16th century
 - First scientific excavations in 18th century
	 - Major digs between 1920s and 1950s
	 - Archaeological work ongoing
**Setting**:
 - Situated near Bay of Naples, 8km south of Vesuvius
 - Earliest settlement from 8th century BCE
	 - Growth accelerated after 450 BCE under Greeks following Battle of Cumae
 - Entered Roman sphere in late 4th century BCE after Samnite and Latin Wars
	 - Eventually becoming *socii* (confederate) of Rome
 - Pompeii became very prosperous due to rich agricultural lands
	 - City was an important passage for maritime goods transferred along Appian Way
 - Wealthy Romans constructed numerous villas (country houses) due to desirable climate
 - Population around 11k in 79 CE based on household counts
**Eruption of Vesuvius**:
 - Major earthquake in 62 CE caused widespread destruction around Bay of Naples
 - Minor tremors reported four days prior to autumn 79 CE
	 - Did not alarm the people of the area
 - Eruption lasted two days, ejecting tephra and gases to a height of 33 km
	 - Later generated pyroclastic flows, earthquakes, tsunamis
 - Surviving written testimony from Pliny the Younger, observed the eruption 29 km away across Bay of Naples
 - Some rescues and escapes during the early stages of the eruptions
	 - Pyroclastic flows and building collapses killed many within Pompeii, Herculaneum, surrounding area
 - Ash falls and flows reached temperatures of up to 360 Celsius (680 Fahrenheit)
	 - Asphyxiation and incineration of residents
**Excavation of the Aftermath**:
 - As of 2003: Over 1000 casts made from impressions of bodies in ash deposits recovered in and around Pompeii
	 - 100 additional bodies from Pompeii and 322 from Herculaneum
	 - Total number of fatalities remain unknown
 - Pyroclastic temperatures killed people in a fraction of a second
	 - Organs and blood vaporized, at least one victims brain was vitrified (turned to glass)
 - Casts of livestock and dogs also recovered from Pompeii
**Modern Archaeology at Pompeii**:
 - Between 1920s and 1950s, Italian archaeologist Amedeo Mairui conducted grand excavations
 - Excavated older layers beneath 79 CE eruption for the first time
	 - Uncovered majority of city wall, vast amount of area south of Via del'Abbondanza
 - His work was poorly documented scientifically, his reconstructions were difficult to distinguish from original ruins
	 - Portions of the site have been set aside for future generations of archaeologists
	 - Present work confined to areas of past excavation
**Pompeii's Amazing Past**:
 - Urban development accelerated in the Augustan Period (31 BCE)
 - While a relatively small provincial city, Pompeii contained a large amphitheatre, five public baths, large swimming pool and gymnasium complex, markets, inns, brothels, taverns, bakeries, workshops, temples
 - Middle-class and elite town houses + country villas with exceptional frescoes, murals, mosaic art
 - Evidence of daily life in the form of graffiti
 - One graffiti passage helped pinpoint the true date of the eruption of Vesuvius
	 - Scratched lightly in charcoal on unfinished wall of house being refurbished
	 - Reads: "in dulsit pro masumis esuritions" = "he binged on food"
		 - Provides date: "XVI K Nov" (16th day before the first of November, October 17th)
	 - Nearly 2 months after the August 24th date recorded by Pliny the Younger
		 - Likely corrupted after centuries of hand-copying manuscripts
	 - Would explain the presence of autumn fare like chestnuts in the various shops in Pompeii

### End of the Ancient World
 - Roman Empire almost collapsed beginning in 235 CE with the assassination of Emperor Severus Alexander by his own troops
	 - Severan Dynasty unpopular, Roman military required increasingly large bribes to stay loyal
 - During following 50 year period (Crisis of the Third Century), empire saw barbarian invasions & migrations into Roman territory
	 - Also plagues, peasant rebellions, civil wars, political instability
 - 268 CE: Emperor had split into three competing states
	 - Rome
	 - Palmyrene Empire
	 - Gallic Empire
 - Crisis ended with Emperor Diocletian, restructuring of the Roman imperial government (284 CE)
 - Empire would survive until 476 CE in the West, 1453 CE in the East
