### The Worlds Oldest Megaliths
 - Recently rewritten the period long assigned to megalithic/monumental construction
 - Radiocarbon dating indicates the site was constructed 11.6kya, Pre-Pottery Neolithic Period (9.6k-8.2k BC)
 - Period relates to some of the first archaeological evidence of permanent human settlement
	 - Transition to agriculture in the Urfa region
 - Large scale evidence for dense settlement and intensive agriculture and Gobekli Tepe has not been found

### Site Layout
 - Consists of a 15m high, 8 ha *tell* (artificial mound)
	 - Situated on flat limestone plateau overlooking Harran plain
		 - Good visibility in all directions
		 - Access to raw materials for megalithic construction (remnants of ancient quarries)
	 - Prominent landmark in the region, maybe cultural importance prior to megaliths
 - Much drier today, when first occupied was surrounded by open grassland, some woodland
 - Main features of the site are T-shaped 7-10 ton monolithic pillars
	 - Cut from local limestone quarries
	 - Erected in circular compounds called temene (10-30m in diameter)
 - Four circular compounds have been excavated to date, 16 additional have been indicated
 - T-shaped pillars feature carved animal reliefs of local animals
	 - Some headless humanoid figures also appear
 - Used intermittently over period of 1.6k years, abandoned around 8k BC
 - After abandoned, each circular enclosure were deliberately backfilled with refuse (rubble, stone, bones)
	 - Unknown why, helps to preserve carved megaliths

### Daily (Seasonal) Life
 - No farming or animal husbandry, inhabitants were hunter-gatherers
	 - Lived on wild game and non-domesticated cereals
 - Faunal materials recovered from the site indicate large-scale hunting of gazelle between midsummer and autumn
 - Thousands of stone grinding tools recovered, indicating intensive processing of wild grains for porridge (and beer)
 - Pre-Pottery Neolithic site, no ceramics (or metal tools) have been recovered
	 - Cooking done in stone bowls or baskets
 - Some portion of the population may have lived on-site permanently
	 - Cannot be considered a large village or early city like some examples from later Neolithic

### Site Function
 - Worlds first temple, suggests it was a mountain sanctuary, central location for cult of the dead
 - Over 700 bone fragments have been recovered
	 - Human skulls modified with deep grooves, early Neolithic skull cult
 - Ritual and feasting events may have coincided with periods when game availability was at its peak
 - Discovery of some domestic buildings and rainwater harvesting systems indicates both ritual and profane functions coexisted at the site

### Site Construction
 - Archaeologists disagree over how much labour was needed to construct the site
 - Schmidt: Hundreds of people needed to move a single pillar from the quarries (100-500m away)
 - Other archaeologists: Smaller workforce using ropes and water/lubricant
	 - Single structure could be built by 12-24 people in less than 4 months
