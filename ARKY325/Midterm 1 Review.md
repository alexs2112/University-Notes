### Introduction
**Archaeological Study of Civilizations**
 - First Archaeological Research: **Nabonidus**, last king of Babylon, excavated Temple of Ur in Mesopotamia
 - Italian Renaissance: Growing merchant class interested in Rome, encouraged antiquarianism
	 - Antiquarianism: Collection of antiquities just for the sake of it
		 - Lord Elgins marbles (from Parthenon)
		 - Foundation of European national museums
 - Ciriaco de Pizzicolli (Cyriacus of Ancona): First systematic research that was published
 - Grand Tour: Wealthy Europeans went on grand tour of ancient monuments, looted sites
**States**:
 - Government has full authority, backed by force, economic specialization, social inequality
 - Urban living (densely packed populations) with centralized government
 - States emerge with the origins of agriculture and large scale food production

### Theories for Rise and Fall of Civilizations
**V. Gordon Childe: Urban Revolution**:
 - Characterized by invention of metallurgy, economic specialization of workforce, invention of techs
 - Problems: Craft specialization a result rather than cause of states
	 - Production of surplus does not tell us why it developed in the first place, or why cities started
**Irrigation Theories**:
 - Floodplains in Nile and Euphrates was primary cause for rise of states due to surplus
 - Hydraulic State Theory: Karl Wittfogel, Irrigation leads to central authority
	 - Life in dry river valleys require development of group to organize irrigation + surplus
	 - Authority eventually controls everything else and becomes corrupt
 - Current thoughts: Important to many state structures, took centuries before rulers took over
**Technology and Trade**:
 - Trade for raw materials + other goods stimulated long distance exchange
 - Emergent elite accumulate exotic materials, unequal wealth, prestige goods economy
 - Evidence of chiefdoms in exchange of prestige goods to create regional influence (interaction spheres)
**Warfare: Carneiro's Environmental Circumscription Model**:
 - Farmland bordered by non-arable lands is circumscribed (limited)
 - Population increases, pressures food, one group starts conquering until they lead, people can't leave
 - Problems: Not all states emerge in circumscribed environments, unclear warfare is cause of states

### Gobelki Tepe
 - Worlds oldest megaliths, constructed pre-pottery neolithic period
 - One of the first archaeological evidence of permanent human settlement
**Site Layout**:
 - On flat limestone plateau over Harran plain, good visibility in all directions, access to raw materials
 - Main feature are T-shaped 7-10 ton monolithic pillars from local limestone quarries
	 - Carved with animal reliefs of local animals, some headless humanoid figures
 - Four circular compounds excavated to date, 16 additional have been indicated
	 - After abandonment, each circular enclosure was backfilled with refuse, preserves carved megaliths
**Daily Life**:
 - No agriculture, inhabitants were hunter-gatherers
 - Thousands of stone grinding tools, intensive processing of wild grains for porridge and beer
**Site Function**:
 - Worlds first temple, central location for cult of the dead, human skulls have deep grooves (skull cult)
 - Ritual and feasting when game availability was at its peak
 - Both ritual and profane functions coexisted at the site
