### Archaic Period - Early Food Production
 - Earlier dates for plant domestication in the highlands (dry, cool, good preservation)
	 - Many domesticates come from Amazon rainforest, particularly root crops
 - Communication between these areas by 10k-8k BP
 - By 8k BP, rainforest and highland plants are also found in coastal sites
**Introductions from Mesoamerica**:
 - Maize introduced into the highlands between 8000-6800 BP
 - Squash was in the process of being domesticated in coastal Ecuador by 10k BP
**Root Crops**:
 - Difficult to trace (no hard parts) but they can vary in terms of their starch grains
 - Starch grains recovered from grinding stones can be used to identify domesticated varieties
 - Potatoes were probably domesticated around Lake Titicaca area in the highlands by 5k-4k BP
**Manioc**:
 - One of the top dozen of most important crops in the world
	 - Aka Cassava (or Tapioca)
	 - First domesticated in Brazil
 - Starch grains from site of Tres Ventanas Cave (5k BP)
	 - Starches of wild and domesticated crops are distinct
	 - Can recover starch from grinding stones
 - Yams, manioc, arrowroot possibly 7k BP at Aguadulce Shelter in Panama
**Other South American Crops**:
 - Quinoa at Ayacucho Cave, Peru (5000-4000 BP)
 - Cotton at Ayacucho Cave (5000 BP)
**Guitarrero Cave**:
 - Recovered chili peppers, 2 types of manioc, guava, cocoa, beans, peanuts (5000 BP)
 - Hunted deer, gradually replaced by camelids on path towards domestication (llama, alpaca)
	 - Camelids domesticated in highland Peru by 6500 BP
 - Polished bone knives, gourd bowls, cordage, basketry, early textiles
 - Cocoa introduced from the Peruvian montana
	 - Important stimulant in fighting fatigue at high altitudes
### Andean Civilization: Two Areas
 - Develops in two distinctive ecological areas:
	 - North coast of Peru (narrow coastal plain)
	 - South-central Andes mountains (rise dramatically from the plains)
 - Inka are the only state that united the north and south into one empire
 - Intensive trade over thousands of years created common elements in these civilizations
**Northern Area**:
 - Narrow rainless desert plain cut by 40 rivers and streams flowing from mountains to the sea
	 - Only 4 areas can be irrigated
 - Vulnerable to el ninos: Band of warm water & shift in winds off northwest coast of South America changes ocean temperatures and salinity (kills sea plants)
 - Forces fish/birds/sea mammals to move further from shore
**Southern Area**:
 - Southern highlands and coast:
	 - Altiplano, Lake Titicaca Basin, highland Bolivia, parts of Argentina, Northern Chile, South Central Andes
 - Richest zone around Lake Titicaca (alpaca, llama, potato, quinoa)
 - Zone is really a series of elevations that grow different crops at different elevations & exchange these crops among the zones
**Trade**:
 - Thousands of years of interaction between coastal zones - highlands, highlands - Amazon Basin
 - Food, medicine, ideas exchanged among these groups over time
 - Civilizations did not develop in a vacuum

# Late Pre-Ceramic Period (3000-1800 BCE)
### Northern Coast Ritual Traditions
 - After 5000 BCE: Beans, squash, peppers, fruits, maize along coast
 - Reliance on rich fishing resources using nets, spears and reed boats
 - Permanent settlement after 4000 BCE
	 - Fishing and crops, particularly maize, would support large population concentrations
	 - Increased population densities with irrigation farming
 - Participated in exchange with highland areas
 - Cotton domesticated and becomes important after 3000 BCE
**Aspero**: (3000 BCE)
 - Mouth of Supe River Valley
	 - Coastal community with ritual buildings on top of platform mounds
 - Restricted access to inner sanctums
 - Evidence of social differences for the first time in South America
	 - Elite may have controlled ritual, trade, irrigation
 - Contemporary sites along river valleys used irrigation to grow maize, squash, sweet potatos, beans, cotton
 - Trade between Aspero and Caral (and other inland centers)
**Caral**: (3000 BCE)
 - Super River Valley, 22km inland
	 - 6 platform mounds built of quarried stone and river cobbles in one or two phases
 - Used net bags to carry stones to build mounds
	 - Type of construction called *shicra construction*
 - First urban center in the Americas
	 - 3000 people, 20k in Supe River Valley
 - Grew cotton, beans, peppers with irrigation
	 - No maize or potatoes
	 - Reliant on anchovies and other fish for animal protein
 - Abandoned in 1800 BCE, covered in gravel (ritual killing of site)
**Cotton Weaving**:
 - Andeans were skilled weavers of cotton and alpaca wool
	 - Preservation of textiles in dry coastal areas is remarkable
	 - Earliest textiles found date to 2500 BCE
 - Many designs used for thousands of years in Andean art
 - Back-strap loom, more than 200 hues of plant dyes
 - Portray shamanic rituals, elite people carrying trophy heads, geometric designs, animals
### South-Central Highlands Ritual Traditions
 - Preceramic period people have camelids, guinea pigs, potato (and other tubers), quinoa, maize
 - Farmers also needed lowland products to live at high altitude
	 - Protein-rich fish, salt, seaweed (iodine)
	 - Iodine required to combat goiter (thyroid condition prevalent at high altitude)
 - Highland crops (tubers) are found in lowland sites on north coast
**Kotosh Religious Tradition**: (2300-1200 BCE)
 - Temple of the Crossed Hands, start of monumental architecture
 - Many core religious ideas and sacred architectural elements present at Kotosh and other sites in the highlands in this period
 - Elements are part of Andean religious practices, common to highland group through Inka times
	 - These include human hands crossed at wrists (symbol of high status architecture)
	 - Series of niches and friezes on walls
**La Galgada**:
 - Pre-Ceramic site in highlands north of Kotosh
 - Series of shrines (2200-1200 BCE)
 - Early small shrines sometimes turned into burial vaults for men, women, children
 - Called *Huacas*: Sacred places used by later Andean civilizations as ancestor shrines to access spiritual forces

# Initial Period (1800-800 BCE)
### Northern Coast
