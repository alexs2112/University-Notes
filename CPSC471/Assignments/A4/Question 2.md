### Questions
**Find the names of persons who own at least one house in at least one city of at least one country that has a border with Canada.**
```
SELECT DISTINCT ownerName 
FROM HOUSE 
WHERE stno IN (
	SELECT stno 
	FROM Street 
	WHERE cityName IN (
		SELECT cityName 
		FROM City 
		WHERE countryName!="Canada" 
		AND countryName IN (
			SELECT countryName1 
			FROM Border 
			WHERE countryName2 = "Canada"
		)	 
		OR countryName IN (
			SELECT countryName2 
			FROM Border 
			WHERE countryName1 = "Canada"
		) 
	)
);
```

**Find street number and city name of the shortest street in each city in every country that has border with Canada.**
```
SELECT stno, cityName 
FROM Street AS S 
WHERE cityName IN (
	SELECT cityName 
	FROM City 
	WHERE countryName != "Canada" 
	AND countryName IN (
		SELECT countryName1 
		FROM Border 
		WHERE countryName2 = "Canada"
	) 
	OR countryName IN (
		SELECT countryName2 
		FROM Border 
		WHERE countryName1 = "Canada"
	) 
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
	SELECT * 
	FROM Street AS T 
	WHERE T.length < S.length 
	AND T.cityName = S.cityName 
);
```

**Find the names and population sizes of all countries that have a border with the USA.**
```
SELECT name, population 
FROM Country 
WHERE name != "USA" 
AND name IN (
	SELECT countryName1 
	FROM Border 
	WHERE countryName2 = "USA"
) 
OR name IN (
	SELECT countryName2 
	FROM Border 
	WHERE countryName1 = "USA"
);
```

**Find the names of persons who do not own any houses in Canada but own more than one house in the USA.**
```
SELECT DISTINCT H.ownerName 
FROM House AS H 
WHERE H.stno IN 
	(SELECT stno 
	FROM Street 
	WHERE cityName IN 
		(SELECT cityName 
		FROM City 
		WHERE countryName="USA")
	) 
AND EXISTS (
	SELECT * FROM House AS H2 
	WHERE H2.ownerName = H.ownerName 
	AND H2.stno IN 
		(SELECT stno 
		FROM Street 
		WHERE cityName IN 
			(SELECT cityName 
			FROM City 
			WHERE countryName="USA")
		) 
	AND H.hno != H2.hno
) 

EXCEPT 

(SELECT ownerName 
FROM House 
WHERE stno IN 
	(SELECT stno 
	FROM Street 
	WHERE cityName IN 
		(SELECT cityName 
		FROM City 
		WHERE countryName="Canada")
	)
);
```
 - Might be able to use `AND H.ownerName NOT IN`  instead of `EXCEPT`, MySQL does not support EXCEPT

**Find the names and areas of cities with at least one street where no house is located.**
```
SELECT cityName, area 
FROM City 
WHERE cityName IN (
	SELECT cityName 
	FROM Street AS S 
	WHERE NOT EXISTS (
		SELECT * 
		FROM House AS H 
		WHERE H.stno = S.stno
	)
);
```
