### **[Project Specification](https://d2l.ucalgary.ca/d2l/le/content/472128/viewContent/5503783/View)**

### Four Components
1. Project proposal, team contract
2. Intermediate progress reports
3. Demonstration
4. Final report

### Mark Distribution
 - Project Proposal: 2%
 - Team Contract: 2%
 - Extended ERD: 2%
 - Relational Mode: 2%
 - Initial Functional Design: 2%
 - Project Demo: 10%
 - Final Report: 5%
*Total: 25%*
**Caveats**
 - If a group fails to complete one of the components, the group members may each be assigned a mark of ‘Zero’ for all components
 - You have to make sure that your implemented system can prevent SQL injections

### Project Proposal:
 - Find your own real life problem based on external contacts
 - Could involve making a real database for someone running a business, make sure the workload is reasonable
 - Should include:
	 1. Title
	 2. Introduction
	 3. Problem Definition
	 4. Proposed Solution
	 5. Motivation
	 6. Conclusion
	 7. References
 - Must describe some of the functionality to implement. Provide a general overview of the proposed system.
 - Feedback will be given on the proposal

### Intermediate Progress Reports
 1. Detailed ERD due on `October 11th`
	 - Eight unique entity types (not counting subclasses)
	 - At least one weak entity
	 - At least ten relationship types
	 - Entity types for at least two different types of end users (admins, clients, etc)
 2. Initial (logical) relational model generated from the ERD due on `October 21st`
 3. Initial draft design of the programming part of the project, due on `November 10th`
     - Either do both UML diagram & Sequence diagram, or both HIPO & DFD diagrams
     - Also include all possible SQL statements for your project
     - Basic requirements are as follows:
	     - Fot HIPO, specific detailed algorithms for each task are not required but can be developed if needed
	     - For DFD, not only the context diagram, but a complete DFD showing all components of the system
	     - For UML, both class diagrams and use-case diagrams are allowed. Choose either one
	     - For Sequence, either multiple sequence diagrams each for one functionality, or one big one combining the whole process can be submitted
	     - For SQL Statements, need to include all the ones you plan to have in the final submission. Do not all have to be implemented at this time.

### Demonstration:
 - Not a presentation, don't prepare slides. An informal talk with the TA at the end of the semester
 - Need to have a complete implementation of the project at the demonstration
 - Assessed on the following criteria:
	 - Where the scenario and system details fully described?
	 - Was the system well designed and presented?
	 - Were the basic requirements met?
	 - Was the UI functional and appealing?
	 - Were the structure and results of several well-designed queries presented?
	 - Did every group member participate and respond to questions?
 - Evaluated:
	 - Final outcome matches the initial proposal: 25%
	 - Web-based/mobile version is fully working: 30%
	 - User friendly, minimal keyboard input: 10%
	 - Correctness of project functionality: 35%

### Final Report:
 - Due `Deceber 7th`
 - See the project specification above
