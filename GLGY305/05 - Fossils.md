### Finding Signs of Life
 - Mary Anning (1799-1847), Born in Lyme Regis, England
	 - Father, cabinet maker, died when she was 10
	 - She learned to collect and clean "formed stones" for sale from him, used it as a way to earn money for the family
	 - Found the first Plesiosaur and Ichthyosaur fossils
 - Her specimens are in many collections throughout Europe, only she was never given recognition

**Interpretations of the Past
 - As more and more fossils were found, people began to picture ancient life as being quite different from modern day ecosystems
 - Henry De la Beche makes drawings
	 - Creatures are very different in the past, different world

### Types of Fossilization
**Original Body Material**:
 - Insects get stuck in tree sap, which later hardens as amber
 - Baby mastodont being freeze-dried in glacial ice
 - Ammolite: Aragonitic shell of ammonite, prized for its iridescence

**Mineralization**:
 - Permineralization: Trees are covered in volcanic ash, water replaces wood with dissolved silica
	 - Erosion uncovers the fossilized tree
	 - Intricate preservation of the rings and cells of the original tree
 - Replacement: Creature gets buried, sediments harden, hard parts dissolve in water leaving mold
	 - New minerals precipitate in the mold creating the cast

**Rare Fossil Finds**:
 - Burgess shale
 - Catastrophic event buried underwater organisms quickly and completely
	 - Mudslide at the bottom of the ocean
 - Very fine preservation, even of soft bodied organisms
 - Gives us insight into the earliest complex life of the planet

**Compression/Carbonization**:
 - Marine arthropods (Pterygotus) buried, exoskeleton becomes a carbon film in the rocks
 - Plants get buried and the carbon is left as a sign of its existence
 - Large deposits of these carbonized plants (usually signify swamps) will play a huge role in understanding Earth's history

### Industrial Revolution
 - Industrial revolution starts in late 1700s, fueled by coal
 - How to transport amount of coal necessary to fuel industry from the countryside to the burgeoning urban centers
 - Canals became the popular way to transport coal from rural to urban settings

**William (Strata) Smith**:
 - William Smith became famous for his ability to design and build canals, became quite wealthy
	 - Disagreement with a wealthy landowner, lost favor in the higher social circles
	 - Eventually went into debt, ended up at Kings Bench
 - Took an interest in the fossils he was finding
	 - Saw a great deal of Britain's subsurface
	 - Noticed and began collecitng the "formed stones" he saw in the rocks they were exposing
 - Cleaned them, meticulously organized them based on shape and the rocks he found them in
	 - Noticed some systematic arrangements among them

**Correlation**:
 - Smith observed many similar fossils from place to place
 - There seemed to be something systematic about their interrelationships
 - He could predict where he might find some types of fossils (higher or lower in layers) based on other fossils
 - He was able to correlate layers over long distance throughout all of Britain
 - Correlation: Steno's lateral continuity
	 - He was able to link together and order layers across all of Britain

### Biostratigraphy
 - Life - Layer - Write
 - Using fossil signs to connect rock layers over space (lateral continuity)
 - Thickness of sedimentary layers (vertical space) is a sign that we can attribute to mean something about time
	 - Substituting space for time is key in geology

**Implications of Smith's Work**:
 - Discerning a pattern of fossil and rock-types correlated to coal seams
	 - Became a powerful tool for predicting where to find it
 - In this way, social pressures and economics really allowed Smith's scientific inquiry to spread into areas where it wouldn't normally go
 - Able to create the first geological map of Europe

**Index Fossils**:
 - Not every fossil is great for biostratigraphy
	 - The ones that are most useful are called Index Fossils
 - The fossils should show up in each area. Spatially widespread organism when it was living
 - The best index fossils are limited in the duration of their existence, temporally restricted
 - Most of the most useful index fossils are of marine organisms
