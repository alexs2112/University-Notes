### Finding Signs of Life
 - Mary Anning (1799-1847), Born in Lyme Regis, England
	 - Father, cabinet maker, died when she was 10
	 - She learned to collect and clean "formed stones" for sale from him, used it as a way to earn money for the family
	 - Found the first Plesiosaur and Ichthyosaur fossils
 - Her specimens are in many collections throughout Europe, only she was never given recognition

**Interpretations of the Past
 - As more and more fossils were found, people began to picture ancient life as being quite different from modern day ecosystems
 - Henry De la Beche makes drawings
	 - Creatures are very different in the past, different world

### Types of Fossilization
**Original Body Material**:
 - Insects get stuck in tree sap, which later hardens as amber
 - Baby mastodont being freeze-dried in glacial ice
 - Ammolite: Aragonitic shell of ammonite, prized for its iridescence

**Mineralization**:
 - Permineralization: Trees are covered in volcanic ash, water replaces wood with dissolved silica
	 - Erosion uncovers the fossilized tree
	 - Intricate preservation of the rings and cells of the original tree
 - Replacement: Creature gets buried, sediments harden, hard parts dissolve in water leaving mold
	 - New minerals precipitate in the mold creating the cast

**Rare Fossil Finds**:
 - Burgess shale
 - Catastrophic event buried underwater organisms quickly and completely
	 - Mudslide at the bottom of the ocean
 - Very fine preservation, even of soft bodied organisms
 - Gives us insight into the earliest complex life of the planet

**Compression/Carbonization**:
 - Marine arthropods (Pterygotus) buried, exoskeleton becomes a carbon film in the rocks
 - Plants get buried and the carbon is left as a sign of its existence
 - Large deposits of these carbonized plants (usually signify swamps) will play a huge role in understanding Earth's history
