### Marginocephalians
 - Margin = Edge
 - Cephal = Head
 - All marginocephalians have a ridge or shelf of bones that runs across the back of the skull
 - The size is highly variable, but obscures the view of bones at the back of the skull when viewed from above

**Pachycephalosauria**:
 - The Dome-Heads
	 - Pachy: Thick
	 - Cephal: Head
	 - Saur: Lizard
 - Bipedal ornithischians with thickened skull roofs
 - North American forms tend to have high domes
	 - We only really find water-worn skull caps, with some isolated bones
	 - Lots of transport before burial
	 - Probably lived in/near the mountains
 - Asian forms tend to have both high domes and flattened, thickened skulls
	 - Typically able to find complete skulls and articulated skeletons
	 - Buried close to where they died
	 - Lived in a desert with ephemeral streams
 - However, recent studies show that at least some of the flattened skulls may just be juvenile forms of fully adult, dome-headed pacycephalosaurs

**Early Cretaceous North America**:
 - Ancestral Rocky Mountains are being uplifted
 - Rain falls on the mountains, erodes them, transports debris (fossils) downhill in rivers
 - Rivers deposited a thick sequence of sediments to the east of the mountains in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin
 - Only the toughest bones survive

### Pachycephalosaurs
**Feeding**:
 - Clearly herbivorous
 - Simple, peg-like teeth for cropping at the front of the mouth
 - Small rhamphotheca (beak)
 - Uniformly-shaped cheek teeth with small, triangular crowns and serrations for cutting or puncturing plant leaves or fruit
 - Large guts (broad ribcage) for digesting plant matter (fermentation vats)

**Skulls**:
 - Many pachycephalosaurs had enlarged skulls, might think they have giant brains
 - However, they had unremarkable, typical ornithischian brans
	 - The dome was just thick bone, no extra space for brains
	 - Had particularly enlarged olfactory lobes (good sense of smell)
	 - Brain was tilted down towards the back of the skull
 - Infer that it is for butting heads
 - The dome:
	 - The structure of the dome is very dense
	 - Bone fibres are oriented perpendicular (right angles) to the external surface of the dome
	 - This may help distribute forces around the brain like a built-in helmet
 - H.D. Sues decided to test how a braincase would distribute stress from head butting
	 - Built a plastic model of stegoceras (small pachycephalosaur, no a stegosaur)
	 - The stress lined mimicked the orientation of the columnar bone, reinforcing the idea that the fibrous columns evolved to resist stresses induced by head-butting
 - More evidence for head-butting:
	 - Rotation of bones at back of skull minimizes potential for violent rotation or dislocating head
	 - Little known about the neck, except neck muscles were strong
		 - Muscle attachment scars used as proxy for muscle strength
	 - Further down the spine, vertebrae are uniquely linked with a tongue and groove articulation
		 - Made spine very rigid, limited lateral rotation
 - Evidence against head-butting:
	 - Skull cap of Stygimoloch (North American pachycephalosaur) contains a network of canals for blood vessels
	 - If Stygimoloch is a distinct species, then the dome is likely for display rather than head-butting
		 - But, if Stygimoloch is a juvenile Pachychephalosaurus, maybe head-butting is only an adult behaviour
 - Cranial injuries in Pachycephalosaurs:
	 - 22% of skulls studied have injuries representing infections from trauma
		 - Concentrated near the apex, but occur all over the dome
	 - No difference in rate of injury among different genera
	 - Flat-headed morphs do not have injuries
 - Possible that the dome was for both display and combat, either way, social behaviour is implied
	 - Social animals often exhibit sexual dimorphism
	 - Potential sexual dimorphism in Stegoceras (not Stegosaurus) skulls
		 - Some studies indicate there are two distinct groups based on size and shape
		 - Ratio of small domes to large domes is 1:1 (male:female)
	 - More recent data suggests that these size differences are the result of ontogenetic change (change during growth)

**Visual Display**:
 - Had a suite of features related to visual display
	 - Dome
	 - Canine-like teeth (threat display/biting combat with rivals)
	 - Knobby/spiny osteoderms on the snout/side of the face and marginocephalian shelf
	 - Likely, male with best looking domes, knobs, and spikes got to perpetuate the family line

### Ceratopsia
 - Cera: Horn; Tops: Face
 - Traits distinguishing Ceratopsia from Pachycephalosauria:
	 - Quadrupedal, not Bipedal
	 - Smaller amount of bigger horns, not a ring of small horns
 - All ceratopsians have:
	 - A unique bone at the tip of the snout (rostral bone)
	 - Narrow skulls with a hooked beak
	 - A skull that flares in the cheek region (jugal "horns")
	 - A bony shelf of variable size (up to 2m long) that extends off the back of the head (frill)
	 - Thick hooves on all toes
 - Like the Pachycephalosaur, mainly found in Asia and Western North America
	 - Only in Northern Hemisphere
 - Most also had facial horns, but basal forms lack horns
	 - Horns consist of a bony core with a sheath of keratin, only the core gets preserved
		 - Horn was much larger than what is preserved in fossils
	 - Unlike antlers, horns are not shed

**Evolution of Ceratopsia**:
 - The basal forms (Yinlong, Psittacosaurus, Archaeoceratops) were from Asia
	 - Ceratopsidae (larger horned dinosaurs) were mainly from North America
 - Interpreted transition towards larger frills that display & competition were more important

**Migration of Ceratopsia**
 - Comparison of basal and derived ceratopsians with their biogeograpgy (where they were found) suggests that, early on, a neo-basal ceratopsian similar to Protoceratops migrated from Asia to North America
 - Route likely along the Bering Straits, where land was briefly exposed

**The North American Split**:
 - Centrosaurines:
	 - Typically short frills
	 - Typically short horns over the orbitals (<15% of the frill)
	 - Typically more ornamented frills
	 - Eg. *Centrasaurus*
 - Chasmasaurines:
	 - Typically long frills
	 - Typically long horns over the orbitals, short horns over nasals
	 - Frill can vary widely in shape
	 - Elongated snouts, enlarged rostral
	 - Eg. *Triceratops*

**Ceratopsia: Feeding**:
 - Ceratopsians chewed
 - Hooked rhamphotheca (beak, covered the rostral bone)
 - Inset teeth imply cheeks
 - Blocks of cheek teeth in the upper and lower jaws
 - Small teeth, but grew stacked and overlapping together into a single, functional slicing block
	 - Called the dental battery
 - Highly derived forms had vertical grinding surfaces along the sides of the teeth
 - Like all dinosaurs, worn teeth would most likely fall out and dental battery would replace them
 - Large, sturdy coronoid process (lower jaw structure)
 - Except for basal Psittacosaurus who had gastroliths, ceratopsians had strong jaw muscles
 - Large muscle scars support the idea of massive jaw-closing muscles
	 - Extend from one end of the upper temporal opening and onto the base of the froll
	 - At the other end, muscles attach to the large coronoid process on the mandible
 - May have been picky eaters, inferred from narrow snout of careful selection of plants for food
 - Relatively narrow rib cages suggest that they were not relying on fermentation in the gut to break down food
	 - Chewing enough before swallowing

**Ceratopsia: Walking**:
 - Basal ceratopsians, like Psittacosaurus are small bipeds
	 - Rest are quadrupedal
 - Back legs were fully erect, oriented directly under the hips
	 - Also longer than the front legs, probably quite slow and awkward walking
 - Orientation of the front legs are controversial
	 - Some argue that the limbs are directly under the body like a mammal
	 - Others say the shape of the bones suggest they were sprawling out to the side
 - With legs directly under the body, ceratopsians would have moved like a large, Cretaceous rhinoceros. Otherwise would be much slower
 - The narrow width of prehistoric trackways support the notion that legs were not splayed way out to the sides
	 - Without knowing which exact animal made the tracks

**Ceratopsia: Nests**:
 - First dinosaur nests found in 1922, thought to belong to Asian Protoceratops
	 - Lots of museum displays created showing attentive Protoceratops tending to their eggs
 - 70 years later, discovered they were actually Oviraptor eggs
 - Despite this confusion, juvenile ceratopsians from Asia are well-known
	 - Hatchlings of Psittacosaurus (23 cm long with tail) have been found
	 - Slightly older hatchlings of Protoceratops discovered in nest suggest parental care after birth
	 - Ontogeny/growth stages of triceratops is well known, hold clues towards behaviour

**Ceratopsia: Horns, Frills, Behaviour**:
 - Horns originally interpreted as defense weapons against predators
 - More recent interpretations tend to focus on behaviour within a species
	 - Display, ritualized combat, defense of territories, maturite & species identification
 - Likely more intra-species fighting (amongst own species) due to distribution of wounds
	 - Centrosaurus: Fewer injuries to the skull, flank attacks, locking horns
	 - Triceratops: (the opposite of this idk??)
