### Marginocephalians
 - Margin = Edge
 - Cephal = Head
 - All marginocephalians have a ridge or shelf of bones that runs across the back of the skull
 - The size is highly variable, but obscures the view of bones at the back of the skull when viewed from above

**Pachycephalosauria**:
 - The Dome-Heads
	 - Pachy: Thick
	 - Cephal: Head
	 - Saur: Lizard
 - Bipedal ornithischians with thickened skull roofs
 - North American forms tend to have high domes
	 - We only really find water-worn skull caps, with some isolated bones
	 - Lots of transport before burial
	 - Probably lived in/near the mountains
 - Asian forms tend to have both high domes and flattened, thickened skulls
	 - Typically able to find complete skulls and articulated skeletons
	 - Buried close to where they died
	 - Lived in a desert with ephemeral streams
 - However, recent studies show that at least some of the flattened skulls may just be juvenile forms of fully adult, dome-headed pacycephalosaurs

**Early Cretaceous North America**:
 - Ancestral Rocky Mountains are being uplifted
 - Rain falls on the mountains, erodes them, transports debris (fossils) downhill in rivers
 - Rivers deposited a thick sequence of sediments to the east of the mountains in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin
 - Only the toughest bones survive

### Pachycephalosaurs
**Feeding**:
 - Clearly herbivorous
 - Simple, peg-like teeth for cropping at the front of the mouth
 - Small rhamphotheca (beak)
 - Uniformly-shaped cheek teeth with small, triangular crowns and serrations for cutting or puncturing plant leaves or fruit
 - Large guts (broad ribcage) for digesting plant matter (fermentation vats)

**Skulls**:
 - Many pachycephalosaurs had enlarged skulls, might think they have giant brains
 - However, they had unremarkable, typical ornithischian brans
	 - The dome was just thick bone, no extra space for brains
	 - Had particularly enlarged olfactory lobes (good sense of smell)
	 - Brain was tilted down towards the back of the skull
 - Infer that it is for butting heads
 - The dome:
	 - The structure of the dome is very dense
	 - Bone fibres are oriented perpendicular (right angles) to the external surface of the dome
	 - This may help distribute forces around the brain like a built-in helmet
 - H.D. Sues decided to test how a braincase would distribute stress from head butting
	 - Built a plastic model of stegoceras (small pachycephalosaur, no a stegosaur)
	 - The stress lined mimicked the orientation of the columnar bone, reinforcing the idea that the fibrous columns evolved to resist stresses induced by head-butting
 - More evidence for head-butting:
	 - Rotation of bones at back of skull minimizes potential for violent rotation or dislocating head
	 - Little known about the neck, except neck muscles were strong
		 - Muscle attachment scars used as proxy for muscle strength
	 - Further down the spine, vertebrae are uniquely linked with a tongue and groove articulation
		 - Made spine very rigid, limited lateral rotation
 - Evidence against head-butting:
	 - Skull cap of Stygimoloch (North American pachycephalosaur) contains a network of canals for blood vessels
	 - If Stygimoloch is a distinct species, then the dome is likely for display rather than head-butting
		 - But, if Stygimoloch is a juvenile Pachychephalosaurus, maybe head-butting is only an adult behaviour
 - Cranial injuries in Pachycephalosaurs:
	 - 22% of skulls studied have injuries representing infections from trauma
		 - Concentrated near the apex, but occur all over the dome
	 - No difference in rate of injury among different genera
	 - Flat-headed morphs do not have injuries
 - Possible that the dome was for both display and combat, either way, social behaviour is implied
	 - Social animals often exhibit sexual dimorphism
	 - Potential sexual dimorphism in Stegoceras (not Stegosaurus) skulls
		 - Some studies indicate there are two distinct groups based on size and shape
		 - Ratio of small domes to large domes is 1:1 (male:female)
	 - More recent data suggests that these size differences are the result of ontogenetic change (change during growth)

**Visual Display**:
 - Had a suite of features related to visual display
	 - Dome
	 - Canine-like teeth (threat display/biting combat with rivals)
	 - Knobby/spiny osteoderms on the snout/side of the face and marginocephalian shelf
	 - Likely, the male with best looking domes, knobs, and spikes got to perpetuate the family line
