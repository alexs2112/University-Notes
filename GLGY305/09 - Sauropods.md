### Sauropods
 - *Sauropodomorpha*:
	 - *Saurus*: Lizard
	 - *Pod*: Foot
	 - *Morpho*: Form
 - Extremely large, not very smart, extinct
 - Some characteristics:
	 - Relatively small head (%5% of body length, compared to humans at 12-13%)
	 - Smaller brain size (15m body length, 8cm brain)
	 - At least 10 neck vertebrae that form a long neck
	 - Additional vertebrae in front and behind sacrum (hips)
	 - Enormous thumb with long claw
	 - Long femur
 - Among the earliest dinosaurs (Carnian Stage)
 - Appear early, diversify quickly
 - Basal sauropodomorphs are generally thought to be bipedal
	 - Front limbs are much shorter than hindlimbs
	 - Trunk region is short
 - Lived for over 160 million years, found on all continents (without exception)
	 - Spawned over 100 species
 - Over time, necks became longer, heads became smaller, hind legs and front legs become more equal in length (trend towards quadrupedalism)
 - Were first large dinosaurs, eventually reached gigantic proportions

**Herbivory**:
 - Trend towards a herbivorous lifestyle
 - History of the Sauropodomorphs parallels the rise of tall gymnosperms (seed-bearing plants)
 - Sauropodomorphs were the first to take advantage of tall plants
 - Smaller head for body size reflective of herbivores
 - Foliage was nipped and stripped with teeth
	 - Claws may have aided in ripping vegetation into smaller pieces
 - Perhaps some chewing took place (otherwise swallowed whole)
	 - No flat chewing teeth, no room for cheeks
 - Large bolus of food travelled down the long esophagus to the stomach
 - Barrel-shaped guts with lots of bacteria for fermentation
 - Large animals with small mouths, must have always been eating
 - Digestive system a continuous conveyor belt for food

**Size**:
 - Huge, basic body plan did not change for 140 Ma (good fit for stable conditions)
 - Some reached gigantic proportions
- For a while, tile of largest dinosaur belonged to Argentinosaurus Huinculensis (35m long, 75 tons)
	- Patagotitan may have been larger, estimates made on incomplete skeletons
- Approached theoretical limits of weight support, neural circuitry, respiration, and digestion for terrestrial animals

**Size Challenges**:
 - Need tremendous blood pressure to get blood to a brain that can extend 20 meters off the ground
 - Left ventricle of heart would weigh about 2 metric tons
 - 64% basal metabolism just to keep the heart beating
 - Impulse velocities: 120 m/sec for a 50m sauropod
 - Rearing up like other animals would undoubtedly lead to fainting
	 - The head would be way too high, blood pressure is not high enough to get blood to the brain
	 - Design of hip bones prevent them from doing this

**Breathing Through a Long Neck**:
 - Mammals and reptiles breathe in and out (bidirectional airflow)
	 - The entire trachea is physiological dead space where no O2 transfer occurs
 - If sauropods breathed like mammals and some reptiles, then the long neck would have contained a bunch of unused air
 - Giraffes reduce problem of air space by having narrow trachea
	 - Reduces volume of air filling the trachea
 - Instead, dinosaurs most likely breathed unidirectionally
	 - As do birds, alligators, crocodiles, and iguanas
	 - In this way, the trachea is not a dead space for air

**Why So Big?**
 - Defense
 - Larger bodies housed larger digestive tracts, allowing for digestion of all that plant material
 - Surface area to body mass ratio means larger bodies are heat reservoirs

**Pneumatic Bone Structures**:
 - Need to keep the skeletal structure light
 - Vertebrae has an internal system of cavities and openings
 - Presence of pneumatic bones kept the upper skeleton light
 - Pneumatic bones also help birds with breathing
 - Skull:
	 - Extremely small
	 - Delicately built
	 - Full of large openings
	 - Must be very light because it goes at the end of a long neck
 - Possible the brain becomes better compacted within a small skull, so EQ might go down but intelligence stays relatively similar

**Nostrils**:
 - For some unknown reason, nares (nostrils) migrate to the top of the head on more derived sauropods
	 - Elephants also have nares at the top of their head, for their trunks. Elephants also don't have long necks
	 - Abundance of foramina for blood vessels and nerves supports an inference of fleshy nostrils further down the face, and closer to the mouth than to the eyes
 - Early on, scientists thought it was a snorkel (keep head out of water on long neck)
 - Also believed sauropods were too heavy to live on land, so hypothesized they were aquatic
 - Not until 1950s-70s that the idea fell apart
	 - 1951: Water pressure too high to allow for breathing (physics)
	 - 1970s: Robust hips, dense/pillar-like limbs, weight bearing feet suggest life on land
	 - 1980s-90s: Sauropods found in range of environments from swamps to lakes to coastal areas
	 - We find huge footprints

**Locomotion**:
- Body relatively broad, but trackways are narrow, with feet toward midline of body
	- Few tail drag marks
- Sauropod moved up to 20-30 km/h, but usual speed is about 20-40 km/day based on trackways
- Abundance of single-species sauropod bonebeds  and trackways with many individuals
- Tracks show mixture of adults and young, with young in center of group
- One of the things that make a dinosaur a dinosaur is the movement of the hips

**Tiny Head, but Long Neck
 - 4 ways to make a long neck:
	 - Increase the length of the individual vertebrae
	 - Recruit vertebrae from the back into the neck
	 - Increase the number of neck vertebrae
	 - Combination of the above
 - In sauropods, different groups took different routes
 - Y-shaped neural arches on vertebrae held *Nuchal Ligament*:
	 - Elastic rope of connective tissue that ran down the neck and back to support the head
	 - So the muscles didn't have to work so hard
 - Also had an interlocking system of girders
 - Whole system acted like a suspension bridge
 - Most sauropods (diplodocoids) had near horizontal necks
	 - Based on mechanics of the structure
	 - Probably fed within 2-3m above the ground
	 - Even though they weren't reaching the tallest of trees, they could access more food just by standing in one spot
		 - Very efficient consumers, expending little energy to get a lot of food

**Eggs, Nests, and Reproduction**:
 - Until 1990s, believed that sauropods gave birth to live young
 - 1997, nest sites discovered in Patagonia with embryonic skeletons and skin
 - Several layers of eggs, suggesting mothers returned to site year after year
 - Mothers either buried their eggs and left the site, or communally guarded them
 - Laid lots of eggs to increase likelihood of survival
