### Sauropods
 - *Sauropodomorpha*:
	 - *Saurus*: Lizard
	 - *Pod*: Foot
	 - *Morpho*: Form
 - Extremely large, not very smart, extinct
 - Some characteristics:
	 - Relatively small head (%5% of body length, compared to humans at 12-13%)
	 - Smaller brain size (15m body length, 8cm brain)
	 - At least 10 neck vertebrae that form a long neck
	 - Additional vertebrae in front and behind sacrum (hips)
	 - Enormous thumb with long claw
	 - Long femur
 - Among the earliest dinosaurs (Carnian Stage)
 - Appear early, diversify quickly
 - Basal sauropodomorphs are generally thought to be bipedal
	 - Front limbs are much shorter than hindlimbs
	 - Trunk region is short
 - Lived for over 160 million years, found on all continents (without exception)
	 - Spawned over 100 species
 - Over time, necks became longer, heads became smaller, hind legs and front legs become more equal in length (trend towards quadrupedalism)
 - Were first large dinosaurs, eventually reached gigantic proportions

**Herbivory**:
 - Trend towards a herbivorous lifestyle
 - History of the Sauropodomorphs parallels the rise of tall gymnosperms (seed-bearing plants)
 - Sauropodomorphs were the first to take advantage of tall plants
 - Smaller head for body size reflective of herbivores
 - Foliage was nipped and stripped with teeth
	 - Claws may have aided in ripping vegetation into smaller pieces
 - Perhaps some chewing took place (otherwise swallowed whole)
	 - No flat chewing teeth, no room for cheeks
 - Large bolus of food travelled down the long esophagus to the stomach
 - Barrel-shaped guts with lots of bacteria for fermentation
 - Large animals with small mouths, must have always been eating
 - Digestive system a continuous conveyor belt for food

**Size**:
 - Huge, basic body plan did not change for 140 Ma (good fit for stable conditions)
 - Some reached gigantic proportions
- For a while, tile of largest dinosaur belonged to Argentinosaurus Huinculensis (35m long, 75 tons)
	- Patagotitan may have been larger, estimates made on incomplete skeletons
- Approached theoretical limits of weight support, neural circuitry, respiration, and digestion for terrestrial animals
