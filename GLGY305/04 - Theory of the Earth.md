### Mythical Explanations
 - The early days:
	 - Sumerian Deluge Myth (1535-1700 BCE)
	 - Akkadian Gilgamesh Myth (1634 BCE)
	 - Judaic Noah Myth (6th century BCE)
	 - Grecian Deucalian Myth (early 5th century BCE)
 - Water rises and falls over stable ground. Nile and Tigris-Euphrates flooding
 - The wind is responsible for the movement of the waters
 - Eventually, Hell becomes a fire inside the Earth

### Aristotle's Porous Earth
 - 345 BCE
 - Observations of his homeland
	 - Karst and Volcanoes
	 - Grew up in Greece: Mainly limestone (Calcium Carbonate, highly soluble in water) and bedrock
 - Proposes: Earth is made up of rocky material with vast networks of caverns and galleries through which fluids (air, fire, water) can flow
 - Where fluids accumulate, it fills the caverns pushing the earth into uplands
	 - Where fluids are in low concentration, earth sinks into ocean basins
 - As fluid flows back and forth, transition zones see earthquakes and volcanic activity
 - First to consider vertical land movements to create uplands and basins
 - Aristotle's model lasted well into the 19th century
	 - For some, even into the 21st century

### Hutton's Internal Heat Engine and Eternal Earth
 - James Hutton - 1726-1797
 - Observations of his farmland change is slow and constant
 - Asserted that sediments travel from the mountains to the ocean, deposited then pushed up by "Earth's Internal Heat" back into mountains creating a new world
 - Asserted innumerous cycles of wasting, deposition, and deformation.
	 - "No vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end"

### Seuss' Thermally Contracting Earth
 - Eduard Suess - 1831-1914
 - Observations in the field of the folded Alpine mountains
 - Earth started out as a molten ball
 - It contracts as it cools
 - The crust is homogenous in composition, solidifies, and becomes brittle
 - As the interior continues to contract, the crust crumples to accommodate the contracting Earth
 - Oceans and continents can alternate

**Early Controversy**:
 - Homogenous crust should deform homogenously over the surface of the Earth
 - Major (visible) mountain ranges do not bear this out
 - Land bridges (rising and falling due to crumpling during contraction) can explain biological disjuncts

**Dana's Thermally Contracting Earth**
 - James Dwight Dana - 1813-1895
 - Dana experiences the compressional Appalachian folded mountain belt
 - Earth started out as a molten ball and contracts as it cools
 - The crust is heterogeneous (lower and higher densities)
 - As the interior continues to contract, the crust crumples, especially along continental margins, the accommodate the contracting Earth
 - Oceans and continents are permanent
 - Sea levels are higher, as oceans get cooler they get deeper

### Biological Disjuncts
 - How do we explain the same fossil organisms on currently separated continents?
 - Seuss + Dana: Land bridges allowed creatures to cross to different continents
	 - Land bridges were already supported with evidence
 - Baily Willis - 1857-1949
 - Charles Schuchert -  1858-1942

### Wegener's Horizontal Displacement
 - 1880-1930
 - PhD in Astronomy
 - Interested in atmospheric thermodynamics
	 - Bottom-up approach to meteorology
 - His textbook revolutionizes some aspects of meteorology
	 - No real geology background
 - Views atlas with a friend, notes the congruence between the west African and East South American coastlines and decides it would be worth investigating
	 - Wrote a book on the idea that the continents are moving independent of each other
	 - Proposed supercontinent of Pangaea
 - Possible experience with icebergs giving him his idea of drifting continents

### Pratt Model of Isostasy
 - John Henry Pratt - 1809-1871
 - Noticed a discrepancy in expected gravity measurements
	 - Mountains not as massive as expected
	 - Ocean crust much more massive than expected
 - Develops the Pratt model of isostasy (1855)
 - Followed immediately by the Airy (George Biddle Airy) model (1855)

**Two Models of Isostasy**:
 - Isostasy: Buoyancy on the mantle
 - Pratt's model is much along the lines of Dana's heterogeneous crust (different thicknesses)
 - Airy's model is much along the lines of homogeneous in thickness of crust
 - The consensus is a bit more complicated

**Hypsographic Curve**:
 - The curve seems to be bi-modal
	 - Lower density continental crust
	 - Higher density oceanic crust
 - A blending of Pratt and Airy
 - Favors Dana's (and Wegener's) assertion of permanency
 - Does not support Suess, land bridges, or isthmian links

### Wegener's Evidence
 - Jigsaw puzzle fit with biological disjuncts
	 - Read lots of papers on different topics to support the idea of a previous supercontinent that broke apart
	 - Glacial deposits in Africa, India, Australia, South America. Just where they shouldn't be today
 - Paleo climate zones (not just the glacial evidence) with his father-in-law, Wladimir Koppen
 - Geology and structural similarities between continents
 - Wegener hired Milutin Milankovich to work on the astronomical forcing of ice ages
 - People hated him, went against the consensus view
	 - Didn't have a good mechanism for the shifting of the continents

### Mechanism of Continental Shift
 - Reverend Osmond Fisher (1817-1914)
	 - "The instability of convection currents... will go far to explain the instability of the earth's crust..." (1889)
 - Arthur Holmes (1890-1965)
	 - Proposed mantle convection as a possible mechanism for horizontal displacement (twice)
	 - Physicists concur that such action could be sufficient to move continents, but dismiss the possibility of mantle convection actually taking place
 - We accepted ice ages, Earth's magnetic field, and gravity without causal explanations

**Regionalism in Understanding**:
 - Drift worked well to explain data in southern hemisphere
 - Northern hemisphere geologists did not need drift as an explanatory tool
	 - Contraction worked well enough for them
 - This also influenced which ideas got taught in what schools

**Furthering the Jigsaw Fit**:
 - Alexander du Toit (1878-1948):
	 - Tremendous fieldwork capacity
	 - Studies and maps much of eastern South America
	 - Matches with work he and others did in Western Africa
 - Edna Plumstead (1903-1989)
	 - S. African, gets a scholarship to Cambridge University for PhD, but must return before finishing
	 - Claled by tile company when they find fossils (glossopteris)
	 - Her interest in this plant leads to more evidence of Gondwana Land connections

### The Earth's Seafloor
**The Desire to Communicate**:
 - Mid 1800s: extending telegraph cables across the Atlantic Ocean became important
 - Protecting such an investment became important as well
	 - Cables were breaking and we needed to know why
 - Collecting data was a long and arduous process
	 - One data point per day
 - We could only see *points* of the seafloor
 - Creating the seafloor was a massive "connect the dots" activity

**Advancing Technology**:
 - SOund NAvigation Ranging - SONAR
 - Listening to echoes of sound bouncing of the sea floor
	 - The time it takes for the echo to arrive indicates the distance travelled
	 - Twice the distance to the seafloor
 - Instead of one data point per day, we got thousands

**Marie Tharp**: (1920-2006)
 - Job opportunities for women in the '40s and '50s
 - Took a geology course and got hooked
	 - Eventually she got a job with an oil company... filing paperwork
	 - Eventually she moved to NYC
 - Maurice (Doc) Ewing offered her a job drafting seafloor data being collected
 - Formalized the anatomy of the ocean floor
 - Discovered a long chain of rugged mountains (taller than Himalayas) running the length of the Atlantic Ocean
	 - And it had a deep valley down its center
 - Colleague of Tharpe's working in the next office was busy plotting earthquake location data
	 - She thought the pattern was significant
		 - Dismissed as "girl talk"
	 - She did get a third authorship eventually, when the data were published

**International Geophysical Year**: (1957-58)
 - The seafloor is an order of magnitude younger than the continents
	 - This would eliminate contraction theory
 - Young crust is hot and high
 - As crust gets older, it gets colder and lower

**1963 - A Verse in Geopoetry**:
 - Harry Hess (1906-1969)
 - Ridges were locations of mantle convection upwelling
 - The crust cracked, allowing mantle magma to enter and fill the crack
 - New seafloor is generated at ridges and migrates away, getting older and colder
 - Robert Dietz later coins the term "Seafloor Spreading"

**A New Theory of the Earth**:
 - The seafloor is much younger than the continents
 - Homogenous crust forms on a smaller earth that begins expanding
	 - Earth was originally a third of the size, and expanded over time
 - Continents break apart with basaltic seafloor forming
 - Bruce Heezen becomes an avid supporter
 - This SHOULD be the end of contraction theory, but geologists are doing continental geology, not marine

### Earth Magnetic Field
**Trying to Explain the Existence of the Magnetic Field**:
 - Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett, Manchester College, England
	 - Trying to understand nature of magnetic field begins studying remnant magnetism of rocks from basalt flows
	 - Thinks the Earth's magnetic field is caused by the spinning of the Earth
	 - Borrows several hundred pounds of pure gold to test the theory
 - Blackett's former student, Keith Runcorn and his colleague Edward Bullard at Cambridge University are studying the same problem
	 - Runcorn thinks the magnetic field is caused by the currents in the liquid core of the Earth
 - Remember, we accepted the existence of the Magnetic field without having an explanation

**What We Measure**:
 - Intensity: How strong is the force
 - Inclination: The direction from horizontal that the field points
	 - Indicates latitude on Earth
 - Declination: The measurement in degrees magnetic north (Nm) is away from true (rotational/geographic) north (Ng)

**Curie and His Temperature**:
 - To understand the Earth's current magnetic field, Blackett and Bullard (and the Carnegie team) started to try to understand the magnetic field through time
	 - An important aspect was how rocks might become magnetized
 - Curie Temperature: If a magnet is heated past this temperature, it will lose its magnetic property
	 - After it is cooled down again, it will assume a different ambient magnetic field
 - Iron crystals do NOT align themselves in molten rock during formation, it is too hot
	 - The magnetic field is assumed AFTER the rock is solidified

**Development of a Timescale of Magnentic Reversals**
 - Analyses of continental basalts over the next decade starts to show systematic results
 - Global magnetic field is reversing occasionally
 - Radioactive dating was becoming much more precise
 - Precision of the timescale increases over time
	 - More sampling covers more time
	 - Enhanced sensitivity of magnetometers
	 - More precision in radiometric dating
 - Observations noted that the reversals were not just in igneous rocks, but also in sedimentary
 - They correlated chronologically with the developed time scale
 - Geologists could no longer ignore the mounting data

**Ronald Mason and Arthur Raff, the Zebra Stripes**:
 - Originally detected by magnetometers dragged behind ships, looking for enemy submarines during WW2
 - No one was sure what to make of these zebra signals
 - Searched other oceans of the world
	 - Pattern was parallel with and symmetric about ocean ridges
	 - Normal - Reverse - Normal - Reverse - etc

### Global Tectonics
**Lawrence Morley**:
 - Recognizes the pattern and symmetry about the ridge axis
 - He combines:
	 - Hess's geopoetry (seafloor spreading)
	 - Magnetic anomalies
	 - Magnetic reversal time scale
 - Basically, as new ocean crust formed in ocean rifts, it recorded the ambient magnetic field at that time
	 - Submitted a paper for *Nature*
		 - Rejected, not enough evidence
	 - Paper for *Journal of Geophysical Research*
		 - Also rejected, interesting idea, more appropriate over martinis rather than in this Journal
 - Other paper at Cambridge, authored by Fred Vine and Drummond Matthews, come up with the same theory
	 - Submitted a paper for *Nature*
	 - Instantly accepted in the same year, after Morley's rejection

**Contributions of J. Tuzo Wilson**:
 - Wilson (1908-1993) was originally a staunch fixist
 - Converted to mobilism and became a great advocate
	 - Ridges and paleomagnetic evidence
 - Asked what we would expect to see if the seafloor was spreading
 - Noticed a pattern of volcanism on the seafloor
	 - Narrow chain of volcanic islands and seamounts getting increasingly older away from Hawaii
 - Wilson saw a stationary "hot spot" causing the pattern as ocean crust moved over top of it
 - The "trail" of volcanoes and seamounts indicate the direction of crustal movement
	 - As the crust slides over the stationary hot spot, it creates a line of volcanoes

**Wilson's Model of Mantle Plumes
 - Had multiple models for convection in the mantle
 - He saw the hot spot, or plume emanating from a stationary point in the mantle not convecting
 - Morgan, 1972: Placed the hot spot in the lower mantle instead of near the surface
	 - Purely because it looked better
	 - Claimed it provides the motive force for continental drift
	 - Idea took off
 - Denser crust moving over less dense crust turns into subduction zones (sucking down and consuming the crust into the mantle)
 - Wilson figured  that due to the shape of the earth (sphere) long linear zones of compression or extension could not exist without some lateral compensation
 - Saw the fissures orthogonal to the ridge system as these compensatory structures
	 - Published "A New Class of Faults" in 1965

**New Global Tectonics**:
 - Paper written in Columbia University
 - Usually considered to be the decisive paper denoting a new theory of the Earth
 - It also supplied convection as a mechanism
 - Submarine evidence, most geologists only really care about geology on the continent
 - Tanya Atwater brings the new global tectonics onto land (1970)
 - The San Andreas fault is a long transform fault connecting two ridge/rift systems

### Birth of a Theory
 - Crust deforms in narrow regions due to relative motions
 - Like Dana's and Wegener's model, heterogeneous crust
 - Holmes and Hess provide
