### Mythical Explanations
 - The early days:
	 - Sumerian Deluge Myth (1535-1700 BCE)
	 - Akkadian Gilgamesh Myth (1634 BCE)
	 - Judaic Noah Myth (6th century BCE)
	 - Grecian Deucalian Myth (early 5th century BCE)
 - Water rises and falls over stable ground. Nile and Tigris-Euphrates flooding
 - The wind is responsible for the movement of the waters
 - Eventually, Hell becomes a fire inside the Earth

### Aristotle's Porous Earth
 - 345 BCE
 - Observations of his homeland
	 - Karst and Volcanoes
	 - Grew up in Greece: Mainly limestone (Calcium Carbonate, highly soluble in water) and bedrock
 - Proposes: Earth is made up of rocky material with vast networks of caverns and galleries through which fluids (air, fire, water) can flow
 - Where fluids accumulate, it fills the caverns pushing the earth into uplands
	 - Where fluids are in low concentration, earth sinks into ocean basins
 - As fluid flows back and forth, transition zones see earthquakes and volcanic activity
 - First to consider vertical land movements to create uplands and basins
 - Aristotle's model lasted well into the 19th century
	 - For some, even into the 21st century

### Hutton's Internal Heat Engine and Eternal Earth
 - James Hutton - 1726-1797
 - Observations of his farmland change is slow and constant
 - Asserted that sediments travel from the mountains to the ocean, deposited then pushed up by "Earth's Internal Heat" back into mountains creating a new world
 - Asserted innumerous cycles of wasting, deposition, and deformation.
	 - "No vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end"

### Seuss' Thermally Contracting Earth
 - Eduard Suess - 1831-1914
 - Observations in the field of the folded Alpine mountains
 - Earth started out as a molten ball
 - It contracts as it cools
 - The crust is homogenous in composition, solidifies, and becomes brittle
 - As the interior continues to contract, the crust crumples to accommodate the contracting Earth
 - Oceans and continents can alternate

**Early Controversy**:
 - Homogenous crust should deform homogenously over the surface of the Earth
 - Major (visible) mountain ranges do not bear this out
 - Land bridges (rising and falling due to crumpling during contraction) can explain biological disjuncts

**Dana's Thermally Contracting Earth**
 - James Dwight Dana - 1813-1895
 - Dana experiences the compressional Appalachian folded mountain belt
 - Earth started out as a molten ball and contracts as it cools
 - The crust is heterogeneous (lower and higher densities)
 - As the interior continues to contract, the crust crumples, especially along continental margins, the accommodate the contracting Earth
 - Oceans and continents are permanent
 - Sea levels are higher, as oceans get cooler they get deeper

### Biological Disjuncts
 - How do we explain the same fossil organisms on currently separated continents?
 - Seuss + Dana: Land bridges allowed creatures to cross to different continents
	 - Land bridges were already supported with evidence
 - Baily Willis - 1857-1949
 - Charles Schuchert -  1858-1942

### Wegener's Horizontal Displacement
 - 1880-1930
 - PhD in Astronomy
 - Interested in atmospheric thermodynamics
	 - Bottom-up approach to meteorology
 - His textbook revolutionizes some aspects of meteorology
	 - No real geology background
 - Views atlas with a friend, notes the congruence between the west African and East South American coastlines and decides it would be worth investigating
	 - Wrote a book on the idea that the continents are moving independent of each other
	 - Proposed supercontinent of Pangaea
 - Possible experience with icebergs giving him his idea of drifting continents

### Pratt Model of Isostasy
 - John Henry Pratt - 1809-1871
 - Noticed a discrepancy in expected gravity measurements
	 - Mountains not as massive as expected
	 - Ocean crust much more massive than expected
 - Develops the Pratt model of isostasy (1855)
 - Followed immediately by the Airy (George Biddle Airy) model (1855)

**Two Models of Isostasy**:
 - Isostasy: Buoyancy on the mantle
 - Pratt's model is much along the lines of Dana's heterogeneous crust (different thicknesses)
 - Airy's model is much along the lines of homogeneous in thickness of crust
 - The consensus is a bit more complicated

**Hypsographic Curve**:
 - The curve seems to be bi-modal
	 - Lower density continental crust
	 - Higher density oceanic crust
 - A blending of Pratt and Airy
 - Favors Dana's (and Wegener's) assertion of permanency
 - Does not support Suess, land bridges, or isthmian links

### Wegener's Evidence
 - Jigsaw puzzle fit with biological disjuncts
	 - Read lots of papers on different topics to support the idea of a previous supercontinent that broke apart
	 - Glacial deposits in Africa, India, Australia, South America. Just where they shouldn't be today
 - Paleo climate zones (not just the glacial evidence) with his father-in-law, Wladimir Koppen
 - Geology and structural similarities between continents
 - Wegener hired Milutin Milankovich to work on the astronomical forcing of ice ages
