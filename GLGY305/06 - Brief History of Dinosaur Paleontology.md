### Very Early Discoveries
 - 206 BCE to 220 CE
 - The Silk Road: Major trade route between China, the rest of Asia, and Europe
 - On theory suggests that the Griffin lore may have been based on discoveries of Protoceratops in the Gobi desert

### Age of Enlightenment
 - During the 1600s-1700s, major scientific discoveries are drawn
 - Earth changes over time and Earth is really old
 - Stratigraphic principles of relative dating (Steno)
 - Fossils are the remains of ancient creatures
 - Organisms change over time (Darwin)
 - The first dinosaur fossil is described by Reverend Dr. Robert Plot in England in 1677

**First Dinosaur Bone Described in a Paper**:
 - Plot believed it was the end of a large thigh bone of a pre-Biblical Flood giant
	 - Looked like a human bone, but giant
	 - First he believed it was a giant Roman War Elephant
		 - Eventually decided it was actually a giant human?

**First Dinosaurs Discovered by Westerners**:
 - Mary Ann Mantell discovers what look like iguana teeth but are way bigger
	 - Eventually named Iguanodon
 - Husband of Mary Ann Mantell, Gideon Mantell, buys bones from a fossil dealer who collected them after an explosion in a quarry
	 - Turned out to be the most complete non-avian dinosaur found yet: A partially articulated Hylaeosaurus (anklyosaur)
 - They eventually discover a more complete specimen of Iguanodon
	 - Found a bone that they thought was a horn, turned out to be a thumb

**Another Discovery in England**:
 - William Buckland finds the first lower jaw of what he believes is a rather large lizard
 - Names it Megalosaurus

### Signs of Life to Interpret History
**Georges Cuvier** (1769-1832):
 - Brilliant anatomist, studied skeletons of mainly large mammal fosils
 - Skeptical of Anning's find (Plesiosaur)
	 - Anning was subsequently vindicated by another expert
 - Used fossils to interpret past environments
 - Interpreting the signs led to the idea of mass extinctions
	 - Violent revolutions (named after French revolution?) causing mass-scale deaths
	 - Founder of catastrophism
 - Catastrophism was a substantial departure from uniformatism (conventional thought at the time)

**Developing a Chronology for the Earth**:
 - Based on descriptions of rocks and correlated using fossils (by late 19th century)
 - Eras based on the signs of life recorded in the rocks
 - Period names based on where the orginal rocks of that age were described
	 - Major characteristics of the rocks
 - The boundaries between eras and periods reflected by signs in the rocks
	 - Usually appearance or disappearance of life forms
	 - Example: Mass extinction events
 - Index fossils were very important for positioning the boundaries between periods

**Different Ideas of Evolution**:
 - 1801: Lamarckian (Jean Baptiste de Lamarck)
	 - Animals develop new characteristics due to environmental pressures
	 - Parents pass these characteristics off to young
	 - Animals in dynamic equilibrium (uniformity) with environment
 - 1859: Natural Selection (Charles Darwin)
	 - Environmental pressure creates a struggle for existence
	 - Variation on a population affect success at the struggle
	 - These variations are passed to future generations
	 - Originally designed to explain minor biological changes between members of the same species in different locations
 - 1800s: Cuvier did not buy into the idea of gradual change of species
	 - Species were fine-tuned to fit with all other life and environment (static)
	 - Environmental change (revolution/catastrophe) would cause extinction
	 - Never had an explanation where species came from
