### Very Early Discoveries
 - 206 BCE to 220 CE
 - The Silk Road: Major trade route between China, the rest of Asia, and Europe
 - On theory suggests that the Griffin lore may have been based on discoveries of Protoceratops in the Gobi desert

### Age of Enlightenment
 - During the 1600s-1700s, major scientific discoveries are drawn
 - Earth changes over time and Earth is really old
 - Stratigraphic principles of relative dating (Steno)
 - Fossils are the remains of ancient creatures
 - Organisms change over time (Darwin)
 - The first dinosaur fossil is described by Reverend Dr. Robert Plot in England in 1677

**First Dinosaur Bone Described in a Paper**:
 - Plot believed it was the end of a large thigh bone of a pre-Biblical Flood giant
	 - Looked like a human bone, but giant
	 - First he believed it was a giant Roman War Elephant
		 - Eventually decided it was actually a giant human?

**First Dinosaurs Discovered by Westerners**:
 - Mary Ann Mantell discovers what look like iguana teeth but are way bigger
	 - Eventually named Iguanodon
 - Husband of Mary Ann Mantell, Gideon Mantell, buys bones from a fossil dealer who collected them after an explosion in a quarry
	 - Turned out to be the most complete non-avian dinosaur found yet: A partially articulated Hylaeosaurus (anklyosaur)
 - They eventually discover a more complete specimen of Iguanodon
	 - Found a bone that they thought was a horn, turned out to be a thumb

**Another Discovery in England**:
 - William Buckland finds the first lower jaw of what he believes is a rather large lizard
 - Names it Megalosaurus
