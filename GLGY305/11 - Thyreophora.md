### Thyreophora
 - Main groups of Genasauria include: Thyreophora and Cerapoda (Marginocephalia + Ornithopoda)
 - Genasauria: Gena=Cheek, Saur=Lizard
	 - Cheeks imply chewing
 - Thyreophora: Genasaurs with embedded dermal armor-bony plates, along back surface of body
	 - Quadrupedal, evolved back from bipedal
	 - Other dinosaurs have armor, other modern-day creatures have armor, is this convergent evolution or homologous in tetrapods?

**Other Dinosaurs with Armor**:
 - Some dinosaurs, like Amargasaurus, also have elaborate bony structures along their spine
	 - Resemble plates of Stegosaurus, are actually extensions of vertebrae called neural spines
	 - Plates in stegosaurus are embedded in the skin, not attached to the spine
	 - A flap of skin may have joined the spines into a sail-like structure

**Primitive Thyreophora**:
 - Began as small, bipedal, and gracile (basal condition of all dinosaurs)
	 - Rows of osteoderms down the back and tail (Scutellosaurus)
	 - Quickly evolved into large, quadrupedal dinosaurs (Scelidosaurus)
	 - All derived thyreophorans are quadrupedal

**Diet**:
 - Cropped and stripped foliage with the rhamphothecae (beak)
 - Like all genasaurs, had an inset tooth row
	 - Suggests muscular cheeks and chewing
	 - Teeth are small, simple, triangular, lack regular grinding surfaces, do not fit together well
		 - Coronoid process (mandible) is also small
		 - Chewing likely existed, but was inefficient
 - Heads were low to the ground, probably restricted to low level plants <1m off the ground

**Two Great Clades (Groups)**:
 - Stegosauria
 - Ankylosauria
 - (plus other, miscellaneous thyreophorans)

### Stegosauria
 - Few fossils, global distribution
 - Did not live for that long
 - Stegosaurs (Roofed-Lizards): Medium sized dinosaurs, 3-9m long, 300-1500 kg
	 - Osteoderms have developed into plates and spines in two rows along the back
 - Long hind limbs, short forelimbs, quadrupedal

**Locomation**:
 - Long hindlimbs covered more distance per step than short forelimbs
 - Solutions:
	 - Walk really slowly
	 - Lift the forelimbs up when running
 - Very unlikely that stegosaurs ran bipedally because their weight is distributed towards the head
	 - Max speed: 6.5-7 km/h
	 - Likely lived a life of leisure

**Small EQ**:
 - Early workers thought it was impossible for a dinosaur to have such a small EQ
 - Felt compelled to assign them an extra brain the enlarged canal of the vertebrae around the hips
	 - No longer think this is true
	 - Not really sure what this is for
		 - Maybe organ to supply sugar to the nervous system like in some birds
 - Long, tiny brains with a slightly enlarged olfactory lobe (for smelling)
	 - Roughly the size and shape of a hotdog

**Fossil Record**:
 - Specimens of stegosaurs are relatively rare and incomplete
 - A few juveniles and adolescents have been found
	 - No nests, eggshells, or hatchling material have been found (yet)
 - Mass accumulation of associated *Kentrosaurus* and *stegosaurus* remains suggest that at least these animals were gregarious (social or herding animals), but little evidence for others

**Spines and Plates**:
 - Most stegosaurs have at least one row of osteoderms on each side of their back
	 - Osteoderms include spines, spikes, cones, and plates embedded in the skin
 - The tails were stiff and locked together, not very flexible, like a nailed baseball bat (thagomizer)
 - Plates may have made Stegosaurs look bigger and scarier, almost species-specific and have maximum visual impact when viewed from the side
 - The shape of the plates may be gender specific
 - Sexual dimorphism likely exists in Stegosaurs
	 - 50/50 split between circular (male) and triangular (female) plates
	 - Two distinct sizes and shapes of plates with equal numbers
	 - No intermediate forms
	 - All adults from a single bonebed
 - Thermoregulation:
	 - Exterior surfaces have many grooves and interiors may have a network of channels
		 - Blood vessels can exchange heat with the atmosphere
	 - Experiment showed that the natural arrangement of plates in symmetrical pairs would have helped to dissipate heat
 - In 2005, another study showed there wasn't a network of conduits and the grooves were merely for supplying nutrients to the keratinized sheath that would have covered the plates in real life
 - Based on limited fossil evidence, juveniles did not appear to have plates or spikes

**Series of Contradictions**:
 - Chewers that did not chew well
 - Dumb, slow-moving thermoregulators
	 - Lacked sophisticated neural controls usually associated with thermoregulation
 - Sexual display seems prominent, little evidence for gregariousness
	 - Did not hang out in groups
 - Solution: Find more fossils
