### Theropods
 - One type of kingdom dinosauria
	 - Therapoda = "beast foot"
	 - Bipedal, active runners
 - Knife-like teeth
	 - Thin, curved backwards, serrated
 - Extra openings in front of the antorbital fenestrae called the promaxillary fenestrae
 - Large hands with grasping ability
 - Hollow vertebrae and limb bones
 - The limb bones of theropods are hollow with a thin, dense outer layer
	 - These likely housed air sacs, especially in derived forms, that made them efficient breathers (unidirectional)
 - Combination of a light skeleton and unidirectional breathing would allow them to be very active predators
 - Birds also have very thin, hollow bones, providing strong evidence that birds evolved from theropods

**Diversity**:
 - Many of these diagnostic characters are lost or modified in derived therapods:
 - Very toothy to toothless
 - Peg-like teeth become less flat in some groups
 - Carnivores to Omnivores to Herbivores
 - Some developed solid limb bones
 - Ranged from the size of a small bird to a T. rex
 - A lot of different types of therapod dinosaurs
	 - Within each group, members can look very similar
	 - Don't need to memorize genera or species, just understand how they divide into groups
 - Therapods are known from the beginning to the end of the Mesozoic
	 - Large geographical distribution
	 - Have been found on every single continent (except australia?) from virtually every kind of terrestrial environment
		 - Diversity in theropod habitats led to diversity in morphology of the theropods

**Birds are Theropod Dinosaurs**:
 - Lineage of theropod dinosaurs that survived the end Cretaceous mass extinction event
	 - Otherwise wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs
	 - 65 million years ago
 - They are the most diverse group of terrestrial vertebrae today, over 10k species (?)

### Theropod Cladogram
 - Herrerasaurids are among the earliest dinosaurs to show up in the fossil record
	 - Unclear whether they are basal theropods or a sister group of the sauropodomorphs
 - Also unclear whether Theropods are more closely related to Sauropods or Ornithischians
 - For now, leave them lumped in with the theropods, but this could change

**Neotheropoda
 - Lose digit 5 (pinky) on hand
 - Functionally 3-toed foot
	 - Footprints of neotheropods consist of 3 toes, a 4th toe is present but held off the ground
 - Furcula present
 - Example: Coelophysoidea

**Development of Furcula**:
 - Wishbown/clavicle
 - Birds are the only living vertebrates to have fused clavicles (collarbone)
 - In addition to strengthening the thorax, the furcula acts like a spring
	 - Storing energy for more efficient flight
 - As the breast muscles contract and pull the wings down, the furcula expands
 - Energy is released during upstroke as the furcula snaps back into place
 - Missing link that identifies dinosaurs as the ancestors of modern birds
	 - Skeletons seemed to be missing this bone
	 - Over last 20 years we discovered theropods did have a furcula, just small & misidentified
 - This discovery moved the arms from out to the side towards the front of the body
 - Archaeopteryx had one too, just wasn't ossified
	 - Visible under UV light, right size, shape, and position
 - All Neotheropods are thought to have a wishbone or furcula

**Tetanurae**:
 - Back half of tail is stiffened by interlocking zygapophyses
	 - Fore-and-aft projections from neural arches
 - Spinosaurus and its relatives are considered crocodile
	 - Croc-like snout and conical teeth (not laterally compressed)
	 - Couldn't resist tortional stresses, so likely fed more on fish/small terrestrial animals
 - Aquatic features: Position of nares, dense leg bones compared to other theropods
 - Some of them had a sail or hump on its back
	 - Thermoregulation, display, perhaps swimming
 - Was originally constructed as biped, but more recent in 2014 constructed as a crocodile-like quadruped

**Avetheropoda**:
 - Characteristics: Loss of their fourth digit
 - Example: Allosaurus
	 - Three-fingered hand
 - Poor steroescopic vision, could only see prey if it moved
	 - How do we know this?
 - Also includes contenders for the World's Largest Land Carnivore Ever: Gigantosaurus

**Coelurosauria**:
 - Characteristics: Enlarged brain, long and narrow foot
 - Example: Tyrannosauroidea
 - Group is diverse, originating in Asia, migrating across bearing land bridge to North America
	 - Life was apparently good in North America, grew to enormous proportions (10m)
 - Some also lost an additional finger, leaving them with only two functional digits
 - Some of the most iconic dinosaurs belong here
 - Some also had simple feathers, Basis for some artists reconstructing T. rex with feathers
	 - Not found any evidence for this yet

**Compsognathidae**:
 - Small, lightly built runners with a downy coat of feathers
	 - Insulation? For show?
 - Example: Sinosauropteryx

**Maniraptoriformes**:
 - Characteristics: Bird-like (pennaceous) feathers and wings
	 - Quilled feathers used for flying
 - Example: Ornithomimosauria
	 - Bird-mimic dinosaurs
	 - Wings with pennaceous feathers that likely were used for display or courtship
	 - They were too big to fly (200 kg)
	 - Three feathered Ornithomimosaurs known from Alberta

**Maniraptora**:
 - Characteristics: Elongated forelimbs, semi-lunate wrist bone
 - Examples: Therizinosauroidea, Oviraptorosauria
 - Semi-lunate wrist-bone:
	 - Wrist bone that has a half-moon shape
		 - The rounded half-articulated with the forearm
		 - Increased flexibility of the wrist joint
	 - Important because it is the bone that allows modern birds to fold their wings
 - This bone and ability to fold hand evolved in maniraptoriforms
 - Includes the closest relatives to birds, are the most bird-like
 - Some groups, like therizinosaurs, were huge with long claws
	 - Lifestyle is largely unknown, most likely herbivores
 - Most tend to be omnivorous or herbivorous
	 - Some derived Maniraptora are carnivorous
 - Oviraptorosauria:
	 - Small to large (<1m to 8m)
	 - Parrot-like head with or without crest, toothless in derived forms
	 - Peg-like spine at top of mouth (eating eggs?)
	 - Short tails
	 - Feathers on forelimbs
	 - Tail fan of feathers on pygostyle-fused bones at end of tail, like a bird
 - Begin to develop omnivore features, instead of strict carnivory ones

**Alvarezsauridae**:
 - Covered in furry feathers, short arms, beaklike head, long tail
	 - No teeth, clearly not carnivorous
 - Short arms, clearly served a function
	 - Maybe for digging through termite mounds?
	 - *Shuvuuia*: Insectivores?

**Eumaniraptora** (including birds):
 - Includes "raptors" with sickle-like killing claws
 - Troodontids (*Anchiornis*)
 - Dromaeosauridae (*Velociraptor*)
 - EQ-Encepalization Quotient is the ratio of an animals brain size to its body size
	 - Used as a proxy for intelligence
	 - Humans are about 6, dolphins are about 4, most other mammals are about 1
	 - Brains don't fossilize, we measure the inside of the skull
	 - Using this method, Dromaeosauridae are also at 6
		 - Other theropods are from 1 to >2
	 - Notes about EQ:
		 - The bigger the body, the more brain is needed to control it
		 - Size might matter, but so does density, arrangement, folding, and lobes
		 - Is EQ a human construct that focuses on only what is important to humans?
		 - What does intelligence even mean?
 - Many attempts (and successes) at flight
	 - Wings as ANALOGOUS structure
	 - Evolved independently in four different groups of maniraptors
	 - Unidirectional breathing makes flight easier
	 - Feathers (for insulation and show? then used for flight)
	 - Perhaps enabled pouncing from further distances, and then flights

**The Bird-Dinosaur Connection**:
 - Archaeopteryx was discovered in 1861 in Upper Jurassic Solnhofen limestone quarry (Germany)
 - Confusing because it had the features of both birds (feathers and furcula/wishbone) and dinosaurs (long tail, hands with claws)
	 - People were confused, got stuck in familiar Linnaean categories (bird or reptile?)
 - Most classified Archaeopteryx as the world's oldest birds, but of 11 specimens found, one classified as a small theropod because the feathers were distinct (?)
