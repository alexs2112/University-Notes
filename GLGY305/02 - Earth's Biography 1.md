### Many Attempts at a Chronology
 - Creation beliefs and attached chronologies belong to all cultural traditions
	 - Earliest being Egyptian dating back over 2700 years
 - Most cited is James Ussher's attempt (mostly by creationists)
	 - Attempted to understand the age of the Earth in the best way he could
		 - Through human written texts, main text as the bible
	 - This was a scholarly pursuit, one to determine the age of the Earth, not to constrain it
 - Based on biblical and other classical references: God created Heaven and Earth in the year of the Julian Calendar 710 (equivalent to 4004 BCE)

**Other Attempts**:
 - Kepler estimated origin to be 3992 BCE
 - Newton used Kepler's numbers, concluded Earth's age to be similar to Usshers
	 - Prediction that the Earth would end in 2060
 - By mid 19th century, there were around 300 different chronologies
	 - Mostly estimating 6000 year old Earth
	 - Based on Biblical information

### Scientific Approach
**Extending Steno's Ideas - James Hutton**:
 - Scottish Enlightenment (1750s)
 - Highly educated, solicitor (lawyer) -> doctor -> "gentleman farmer" (wanders around)
 - Introduced to Newton's ideas during his time as a doctor
	 - Naturalistic world view
	 - Also read Steno's *De Solido*

**Foundations of the Naturalistic (Scientific) Approach**:
 - Claims: Propositional statements of fact
 - Evidence: Supports the claims
 - Assumptions: Rules of the game, natural causes for things that happen in the world around us
	 - Consistency in the causes that operate in the natural world
	 - Evidence from the natural world can be used to learn about those causes
 - **Uniformitarianism**: Ancient processes are the same as modern processes and create the same signs
 - Hutton noticed that changes to the land on his farm appear slow and constant
	 - Surface always in dynamic equilibrium
	 - Claimed each cycle (wasting, deposition, deformation) takes longer than currently imagined (Steno)
	 - Proposed that an uncountable number of cycles have and will continue to occur
		 - "No vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end" - an eternal Earth
 - Unconformity: Layer of the Earth turned vertically by some process (instead of horizontally)
	 - Hard to judge the time of those layers as they become erased by future layers

**Utilizing Observations of the Natural World**:
 - Edward Lhwyd (1660-1709): Glacial valley without knowing it was glacial
	 - Many boulders on the valley floor
	 - Assumed boulders falling from the cliffs was a rare event
	 - Proposed: Must have been a couple hundred thousand years to account for all the boulders on the valley floor
		 - How often do the boulders fall multiplied by how many boulders there are
 - Edmond Halley (1656-1742, astronomer): If one could find a lake with no river exit and measure the saltiness of that lake, one could calculate the age of the Earth
	 - This assumes the lake started out with fresh water with constant influx of dissolved salts
		 - Water flowing into the lake picks up salt and deposits it into the lake
	 - Does not perform the test as he knows there are no instruments precise enough to make measurements
 - Benoit de Maillet (1656-1738): Considered seashells in the mountains as evidence for an original global flood
	 - Since water must be evaporating at a constant rate, he could measure the rate of the lowering of sea level
	 - Assuming a constant rate through time, he could calculate the age of the Earth
		 - Calculates about two billion years

**Sedimentary Rock Thickness**:
 - From the 1860s, began to use a calculated thickness of the sedimentary rock thicknesses to estimate the age of the earth
 - Basic assumptions:
	 - Sedimentation rate is constant, huge assumption
	 - Sediments do not get compressed regardless of how much weight is on top of it
	 - Etc
 - Many geologists attempted to solve this problem with estimates of weathering/deposition rates and thickness of sedimentary rocks
	 - Huge range of ages despite all starting with the same information

**Using a Model**:
 - Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707-1788)
 - Used his iron foundry to create iron spheres of different diameters
 - Heated them up to almost melting and timed their cooling
 - Extrapolated to iron sphere of Earth's diameter
	 - Earth's age: ~87000 years
 - Many big assumptions about the properties of the Earth

**Radium**:
 - Spontaneous radiation, trace elements in Uranium ore (radium and polonium)
	 - Generated heat, affected cancerous tumors
 - Antoine H. Becquerel, Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, shared a Nobel Prize in Physics
	 - Marie is the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, only woman to ever win two Nobel Prizes
	 - Antoine and Marie died of suspected radiation poisoning.
	 - Pierre got hit by a truck
 - Radium was proposed as a life-giving power as it killed cancerous tumors, used literally everywhere
	 - Once the horrors of radium poisoning reached the greater public, attitudes changed
 - Radioactive Decay:
	 - Sometimes atoms get too many particles (extra neutrons). If there are too  many it becomes a radioactive isotope
	 - Radioactive decay happens, removing a neutron and an antineutrino, then changing a neutron to a proton
	 - This is now a different element as it has a different number of protons
	 - Each radioactive isotope has its own signature rate of decay.
