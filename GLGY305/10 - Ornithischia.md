### Ornithischia
 - The armored, horned, and duck-billed dinosaurs
 - According to historical subdivision, there are two main groups of dinosaurs: Saurischia and Ornithischia
	 - Ornithischia are bird-hipped dinosaurs
	 - Saurischia are lizard-hipped dinosaurs
 - in Ornithischian hip, part of the pubis points backwards so it is parallel to the ischium
 - In addition to the backward-pointing pubis, ornithischians also have a predentary
	 - A scoop shaped bone at the front of the lower jaw before the teeth

**Other Bone Changes**:
 - Predentary bone, toothless, roughened tip of snout
 - A narrow bone (palpebral) that crosses the outside of the eye socket
 - A jaw joint set below upper tooth row
 - Cheek teeth with low, subtriangular crowns
 - At least 5 sacral vertebrae
 - Ossified (turned to bone) tendons above the sacral region/further along the vertebral column

**Food**:
 - Evidence supports that ornithischia were herbivorous, consumed large amounts of tough plant matter
 - Many of the characteristics that unite the Ornithischia can be related to eating plants
 - The backward-pointing pubis may have accommodated a large stomach (or stomachs?) and gut region for extracting nutrition from plants
 - The ribs also flare widely out to the sides
	 - Suggests the torso was shaped like a barrel, allowing more space for the gut
 - Predentary supported the beak, used for cropping vegetation, present in all ornithischians
 - Evidence for chewing:
	 - Toothless, rough front tip of the snout, similar to a horse
	 - A jaw joint that is positioned above or below the level of the tooth row
	 - Triangular-shaped cheek teeth with low crowns
	 - Teeth inset toward center of mouth giving cheek space

**Geometry of Chewing**:
 - Carnivores want to cut and shear (like scissors)
	 - Jaw joint in line with teeth, like the joint of scissors
	 - Teeth interact from back to front, to slice and tear food
 - Herbivores want to crush and mash (like pliers)
	 - Jaw joint is above or below line of teeth, like the joint of pliers
	 - Teeth all interact at the same time, allowing for food to be crushed

[maybe missed something here]
### Divisions within the Ornithischia:
**Genasauria**:
 - Share the derived characteristics of inset tooth rows (implying muscular cheeks)
	 - Spout-shaped front to the mandibles
	 - Reduction in size of the mandibular foramen (hole outside of the lower jaw)
 - Further divisions within the Genasauria are based, in part, on how efficient chewing was in each group
 - Main groups include:
	 - Thyreophora (stegosaurus)
	 - Cerapoda, futher broken down
		 - Marginocephalia
		 - Ornithopoda

**Thyreophorans**:
 - Thyreo = shield; phora = bearer
 - Genasaurs with dermal armor-bony plates embedded in skin, along back surface of the body

**Marginocephalia**:
 - Margino (margin) cephalia (head)
 - All bear a ridge or shelf of bone across the back of the skull

**Ornithopoda**:
 - Ornith = bird; pod = feet
 - Iguanodon, duckbilled dinosaurs, and other excellent chewers

**The Beak**:
 - The beak/rhamphotheca of ornithischian dinosaurs is made out of keratin
	 - Keratin is a protein that makes up hair, skin, nails, hooves, claws, beaks
	 - Does not often fossilize
 - The hadrosaurs are a group of ornithischian dinosaurs colloquially called duckbilled dinosaurs
 - The skeletons of large herbivores appear to have flat snouts, and broad duck-like mouths
	 - Led to many semi-aquatic interpretations
 - Dinosaurs aren't just made of bones, they have cartilage, muscle, skin, and all manner of other tissues that do not fossilize
 - Eventually we found a well-preserved beak
	 - Clear that this animal was equiped with a massively downturned, hooked bill that extended way beyond the underlying bony margins of the jaw
	 - Snout suited for gripping, ripping, and breaking things rather than anything duck-like
		 - Keeps with data from coprolites, stomach contents, and so on
		 - Hadrosaurs were consuming tough materials like twigs and bark
