### Relatively Vague Understanding
 - Poor preservation, rocks are continually recycled, metamorphosed, eroded
 - Hard to precisely know the order of events
	 - Our best geochronometers are only 0.1% precise

**Ordered Model**:
1. Birth of Earth
2. Life begins
3. Oxygen rich atmosphere
4. First animal hard parts
5. First land plants
6. First dinosaurs
7. Dinosaurs go extinct
8. First Homo *sapiens*

### History of Life on Earth
**Oldest Rocks and Minerals**
 - Acasta Gneiss in the NWT (Canadian Shield), oldest rock (so far), 4.03 Ga (billion years ago)
	 - Evidence of crustal rocks forming
 - Jack Hills zircons, oldest minerals (so far), 4.4 Ga (in a 3.0 Ga rock)
	 - Trapped oxygen in the rocks

**Origins**:
 - We observe craters on the moon and Earth
	 - Collisions converted into heat, modern volcanoes, examining meteorites
 - Violent beginnings
	 - Molten, sterile Earth, constantly bombarded from space and volcanic eruptions
 - Hadean Eon

**Miller-Urey Experiment**:
 - Produced over 20 different amino acids, along with sugars and lipids
 - Simulated the atmosphere of the early atmosphere and primordial soup, created simple life
 - No free oxygen was a necessary condition (would have destroyed organic molecules)

**Earliest Irrefutable Signs of Life**:
 - 3.5 billion years ago
 - Cyanobacteria develop ability to photosynthesize
	 - CO2, water, and sunlight to produce food
	 - They also release O2, a toxic gas to all life on Earth
 - Oceans begin absorbing O2, ocean sediments absorb it (creating iron oxides)
	 - Land sediments also absorb O2, atmosphere becomes oxygen rich
	 - Creation of Banded Iron Formations (BIFs)

**Bacteria**:
 - Viable bacterial spores 40 million years old
	 - Living in a lake under half mile of ice in Antarctica
	 - Living in the Mariana Trench (deepest place on Earth)
	 - Living 1900 feet below the sea floor in solid rock
	 - Living in water with temperatures between 45-122 Celsius
	 - Living in water with salinities 5 times greater than the ocean
 - Life evolved to suit the bacteria

**Eukaryotes**:
 - With the new oxygenated atmosphere, eukaryotes develop
	 - Life begins to diversify rapidly
 - Many of the organelles in eukaryotes were likely bacteria developing symbiotic relationships with each other
 - Eukaryotes and energy from oxygen allowed the rapid diversification of life toward the end of the Proterozoic and into the Phanerozoic
 - Sexual reproduction allows diversification to take off
