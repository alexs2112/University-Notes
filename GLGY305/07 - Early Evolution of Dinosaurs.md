### Ways to Show Descent with Modification
**Evolutionary Tree**:
 - Time on y axis
 - Group (or kind) development shown as branches
 - Variety within kinds of thickness of branch (x axis)
 - Does not give much information about how groups differ

**Cladogram**:
 - Time is not indicated
 - Set of Nodes with noted marks between them
 - Shows phylogeny
	 - Evolutionary relationships, or most recent common ancestors at each node
 - Noted marks on the graph between nodes indicates the trait that distinguishes the group from the most recent common ancestor
 - Cladograms are constructs
	 - Nodes show divergence from a common ancestor
	 - "Closeness" of relation is defined by closeness to common ancestor
	 - Sister taxa are groups that are more closely related than to any other groups
	 - Red hatch lines indicate the diagnostic feature that distinguishes the group
 - A note about "basal" and "derived" characteristics
	 - Basal: Characteristics that appear first/earliest on the ladder, base attribute
	 - Derived: Characteristics at the most recent parts of the ladder, derived from environment
	 - This may be referred to as primitive" and "advanced", not a declaration of "better" or "worse", just older and more recent
 - Other considerations:
	 - Homologous Characteristics: Present in common ancestor
	 - Analogous Characteristics: Evolved independently (convergent evolution)
	 - Parsimony is defaulting to the simplest representation
		 - The one with the least evolutionary events
		 - This is an assumption

### Early Evolution of Dinosaurs
 - We will focus on early Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods
	 - Along with their demise at the end of the Cretaceous period

**Cephalochordata**: 525 mya
 - Segmented organism with a notochord through the length of its body
 - This is the primitive spinal chord

**Vertebrata**: 500 mya
 - Organism with a segmented spinal column that protects the spinal chord
 - Jawless fish

**Gnathostomata**: 439 mya
 - Jawed and armored fish, skull protects the brain

**Osteichthyes**: 419 mya
 - Fish that have bony skeletons

**Sarcopterygil**: 418 mya
 - Bony fish with lobed fins
 - Able to make short trips out of the water

**Tetrapoda**: 390 mya
 - From this point, growing embryos needed an external source of moisture to survive
 - Eggs therefore needed to be laid in water
	 - Modern frogs and salamanders
	 - Keeps parents tied to the water

**Amniota**: 312 mya
 - Development of the amnion within the egg created a source of water that did not need connection to a body of water
	 - Amniotes could lay eggs on dry land, break for the ocean was complete

**Skeletal Structures**:
 - Life at this time was very diverse
	 - Need to fine tune the classification of characteristics
 - The skeleton plays an important role here
	 - Support of many of the functional characteristics
	 - It is really the only thing that stands a chance of preservation
 - Dinosaurs are diapsids
	 - 2 holes behind the eye in the skull to support jaw muscles
	 - Come after Synapsids (single hole behind the eye in the skull)

**Diapsids**: 300 mya
 - Two fenestrae (openings) above and behind the eyes
 - Diapsids include all birds, lizards, crocodiles, turtles, etc

**Unidirectional Breathing**:
 - Tremendously advantageous for flight
	 - Though found in a lot of animals that don't fly (alligators, crocodiles, and lizards)
	 - Also, not found in animals that do fly (bats)
 - Don't really know when the characteristic developed
 - Unidirectional Airflow: Could inhale and exhale at the same time
	 - Lungs are never waiting for more oxygen rich air
 - Air lingers in lungs if you aren't exerting yourself, which means your next breath will have less oxygen
	 - Reptiles are typically sedentary, could have evolved to keep them from suffocating
	 - Great Dying: Less oxygen in the air, need breathing to be more efficient

**Archoauramorpha**: 252 mya
 - Elongated neck vertebrae
 - Antorbital fenestra: Purpose is unknown, space between the nose hole and the eye hole

**The Great Dying**: 251 mya (Permo-Triassic Extinction)
 - End of the Paleozoic, start of the Mesozoic
 - About 90% of all species were wiped out
 - How did this happen?
	 - Siberian Traps (2 million km^2 lava flows)
	 - Pangaea Forming: disrupts shallow marine life, disrupting rest of life
	 - Impact from space
	 - A combination of the above
 - Extinction opened up a lot of niches
	 - New species diversified incredibly quickly
 - Development from sprawling leg structures (back legs sticking out to the sides) to an upright/erect bipedal stance (dinosaurs, mammals)
	 - Change in bone structure
