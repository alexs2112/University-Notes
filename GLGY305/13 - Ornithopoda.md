### Ornithopoda
 - The "cattle of the cretaceous"
	 - Abundant, Herbivorous, Diverse
	 - Global distribution of Iguanodontia (small clade within the ornithopods)
 - Evolved nearly 100 species and spread all over the world
 - Conditions varied widely, so they lived in a range of habitats and climates
	 - Variability in environmental pressures would lead to the great diversity in this group
 - Remains include skin impressions, ossified tendons, delicate bones in the skull (support for eyes, tongue, inner ear), eggs, and trackways
	 - Ornithopods are found in bone beds and in isolation
	 - Every growth stage has been represented (hatchling, juvenile, sub-adult, adult)
 - ornith = bird (hips); pod = foot
 - Lineage:
	 -> Ornithiscians (Genasauria and Lesothosaurus)
	 -> Genasaurians (Cerapods and Thyreophora)
	 -> Cerapodans (Ornithopods and Marginocephalians)

**Evolution of the Ornithopods**:
 - Cladistics: The ornithopods are hard to pin down
	 - Once thought to simply be 3-toed bipedal ornithischians
		 - Turns out they show a range of postures, aren't so easily identified
	 - Ornithopods include all the non-marginocephalian cerapodans
		 - Defined based on what they are not
 - Characteristics:
	 - Pronounced ventral offset of premaxilla teeth relative to maxillary teeth
		 - Later ornithopods had a toothless premax/beak
	 - Strong depression of jaw joint below tooth rows
	 - Elongation of the premaxilla to contact the prefrontal and/or lacrimal

**Brainiacs**:
 - Ornithopods had large brains, larger than crocodilians
 - Some had larger visual lobe (good vision?)
 - Ornithopods may have had greater reliance on acute senses for protection
	 - Given absence of other defensive structures

**Size Diversity**:
 - Came in a range of sizes
 - Early ornithopods were small (1-2m) and bipedal
 - Later, some members reached sizes up to 17m

**Movement**:
 - Small ornithopods were likely bipedal
	 - Gracile (delicate) bones suggest agility and speed
 - Larger ornithopods were likely predominantly quadrupedal
	 - Sturdy wrist and hand bones, thickened hoof-like nails on central digits for weight-bearing
	 - Some may have been occasional bipeds
 - In all cases, tail is long, muscular, and strengthened by ossified tendons
 - In the largest animals, the tendons extended over the hip region
	 - Provide extra strength and rigidity at the pelvis where considerable stress was placed
		 - Especially during bipedal locomotion
 - Smaller dinosaurs moved faster; larger dinosaurs could run at 15-20 km/h, possibly up to 50 km/h

**Iguanodontia**:
 - Compared to basal ornithopods, Iguanodontians lose front teeth, broaden snouts, and develop serrate margin of rhamphotheca (beak)
	 - Remember: They are not duck-billed
	 - More like grazers and lawn-mowers

**Ankylopollexia**:
 - Many basal ornithopods had delicate forelimbs with 5 fingers
	 - May have used their hands to grab leaves and branches to bring towards their mouths
 - Ankylopollexians had specialized fingers and hands
	 - The thumb (I) was conical and pointed
		 - Close-range defense?
		 - Breaking open seeds and fruit?
		 - Both?
	 - The middle digits (II, III, IV) were tipped with hooves and were fused, so could bear weight
	 - The last digit (pinkie) was flexible and could bend across the palm like a thumb

**Hadrosauridae**:
 - Most well-known ornithopods are the hadrosaurs (duck-billed dinosaurs)
 - Known from the Late Cretaceous
 - Found in North and South America, Asia, Europe, Antarctica
 - 3-17m long
 - Evolution parallels changes in plant diversity
	 - Gymnosperms developed ways to discourage predation (environmental pressure)
	 - Derived ornithopods developed better ways to extract nutrients
 - Characteristics:
	 - Dental battery (rows of teeth constantly replaced)
	 - Modification of feeding apparatus
 - Perfecting the art of chewing
	 - Chewed by combining vertical movement of lower jaw with flaring outward of maxilla (pleurokinesis) to grind tough plant matter
	 - Large gut for fermenting food
 - Some are preserved very well, possible "mummies"
	 - Skin pigment chemicals may break down into anti-microbial compounds
	 - Prevent decay of body tissues
 - Diet: Gut content of hadrosaur mummies: twigs, berries, and leaves
	 - Thought to have been active foragers (browsers) on ground cover and low level foliage from conifers and deciduous angiosperm shrubs and trees

**Hadrosaurinae**:
 - The "solid-crested" dinosaurs
 - Small, solid cranial crests or no crest at all
 - Accentuated nasal arch with huge holes
	 - Possible air bags?
	 - [missed this part]
	 - Some other modern animals puff up in defense or mating strategies, could be similar here

**Lambeosaurinae**:
 - Variety of crest shapes, hollow
 - Crest would not develop (and diversify) unles sit was advantageous
 - Airways go up the crest following convoluted pathways and down into the throat
 - All of that open [also missed this]

**Survival of the Ornithopoda**:
 - Herding (evidence for herd of 10k found)
 - Built for distance, possibly outlast predators
 - Size, grew fast (10-12 years vs Tyrannosaurs 20 years)
	 - Size, just big (11 tons), bigger than predators
	 - Sexual maturity quickly, reproduction happens earlier
