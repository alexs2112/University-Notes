### Climate
 - Combination of average temperatures, and range of temperatures
	 - As well as amount of precipitation in a particular area over a long period of time
	 - Long term average weather
 - Influencers: Latitude, Altitude, Distance from large body of water, wind patterns, ocean currents, mountain ranges

**Latitude**:
 - Distance from poles/equator
 - As latitude increases: (on average)
	 - Average temperature decreases
	 - Temperature range increases
	 - Average precipitation increases (not a smooth trend)

**Proximity to Large Body of Water**:
 - As distance from a large body of water increases:
	 - Precipitation decreases
	 - Temperature range (daily and annual) increases (water moderates temperature)
 - Ocean Current Effects Example: The Gulf Stream
	 - Moves warm (hot?) tropical waters from the lower latitudes to high latitudes
	 - The current warms northern Europe
		 - Palm trees are growing in southern England, same latitude as Calgary
	 - Current would also increase the precipitation

**Elevation**:
 - As elevation increase:
	 -  Average temperature decreases
	 - Average precipitation decreases
	 - Temperature range increases
 - Note: consider other variables, such as latitude, proximity to water, global wind patterns

### Climate During Dinosaurs
 - World during the time of the dinosaurs was very different compared to what we have today
 - Continents reorganized throughout the time of the dinosaurs
 - Climatic and environmental conditions were very different and varied through time
 - As Pangaea started to break up, the continents became smaller
 - Evidence from the signs supports that temperature swings and aridity in the interior of the continents were not as extreme
 - As Pangaea started to break up, climates also warmed up
 - Global average temperature was 4-9 celsius warmer than present

**Evidence**:
 - Observation of coal deposits discovered in different continental locations
	 - Coals form from swamps in tropical climates (low latitude)
	 - Coals form when vegetation falls into stagnant pools of water and does not breakdown
	 - It is buried, compressed, eventually turned to coal
	 - If we find somewhere with a lot of coal, we assume tropical swampy areas
 - Observation of desert sands and massive salt deposits
	 - Desert sands formed in dry places with little vegetation (mid latitude)
	 - Salt deposits formed in lakes and restricted seaways
		 - Experiences more evaporation than influx of freshwater
		 - As water evaporated, salt concentrated and started to form crystals
	 - Dune geometries also indicate general wind directions
 - Observation of glacial till deposits and glacial striations in many continental locations
	 - We find glacial till and glacial striations on continents that are currently equatorial
		 - Indicate glacial flow directions
	 - Glacial deposits indicate high altitude or high latitude

**History of Climate Change**:
 - Climate change is a totally natural and normal phenomenon
	 - Humans can, and have had an effect on Earth's climate
 - We have a very long record of indicators for climate change that extends back to 500mya
	 - Before the time of the dinosaurs
 - Climate change also happened before 500 mya, further back in time you go the less reliable the record becomes

**Signs of Climate Change**:
 - Depositional environments:
	 - Biological signs (mainly plants)
	 - Physical signs (sedimentary structures)
 - Tree Rings
 - Glacial Ice:
	 - Ice traps atmospheric gases in bubbles
	 - Tell us the concentration of greenhouse gasses
	 - The ice record only goes back to around 2.7 mya
