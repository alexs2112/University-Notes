### What is Privacy
 - Numerous competing notions and definitions
 - Privacy â‡” "informational self-determination"
	 - You get to control information about you
 - "Control" can mean many different things:
	 - Who gets to see it
	 - Who gets to use it
	 - What they can use it for
	 - Who they can share it with

### PIPEDA
 - Canada's private-sector privacy law

	- New purposes must be identified prior to use
		- Also must obtain fresh consent from data subject
	- Person collecting must know/be able to explain PoC
2. **Obtain consent**
	 - Informed consent must be obtained prior to collecting, using, or disclosing personal information
		 - Typically sought at time of collection
		 - New use -> Fresh consent
	 - Must not refuse service due to lack of consent, unless info is needed to provide the service
	 - Consent may be withdrawn at any time
3. **Limit collection**
	 - Collection must be limited to what is needed for the stated PoC
		 - Information must be collected legally and fairly
	 - Collector must not mislead of deceive to obtain consent or gather personal information
4. **Limit use, disclosure and retention**
	 - Personal information must not be used for purposes not previously consented to
	 - Collection must be limited to that needed to fulfil stated PoC
	 - Personal information must be discarded once PoC is fulfilled
5. **Use appropriate safeguards**
	 - Collector must provide security safeguards for all personal information collected
		 - Protect against loss and/or theft
		 - Prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification
		 - More sensitive information -> more stringent safeguards
	 - When destroying information, collector must ensure it is destroyed properly
		 - No sensitive files in the dumpster
		 - Deleting a file from disk does not destroy the information
6. **Give individuals access**
	 - Individuals have a right to:
		 - Know what information you have about them

		 - Stale information can lead to unfair decisions
	 - Collectors should seek updated information if and only if it is needed for the PoC
8. **Be open**
	 - Collectors must inform people of:
		 - Policies & procedures regarding personal information
		 - Person accountable for compliance
		 - How to access personal information and the policies
		 - What information is held, how it is used
		 - Who might access the information, and why
9. **Be accountable**
