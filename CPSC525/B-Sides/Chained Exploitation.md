### Chained Exploitation
 - Definition: Cyberattacks that group together multiple exploits to compromise a target in a progressive, step-by-step, process. This will have greater success or impact compared to a single point of entry
 - Attackers will need to tie together multiple vulnerabilities for their attacks
 - Attackers see these vulnerabilities as a graph or chain to be exploited. They need to exploit each part of the chain in order to make it to their end goal.

### Case Study: Phishing to Domain Administrator
 - Started logging in to the administrators account at midnight, attempted this login many times in a row. The administrator eventually approved one of the MFA requests in order to go to sleep.
 - Found an OpenVPN file in the administrator email and discovered the VPN did not use MFA. This allowed the attacker to access the network once they had access to the administrators credentials
 - Use SSH to tunnel out to a DMZ (demilitarized zone) network that the attacker controls
	 - This allows the attacker to gain RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to server hosts
		 - Now has access to the domain controller on localhost
	 - Egress filtering would prevent this sort of exploit as it monitors and restricts the flow of information outbound from one network to another
		 - The lack of egress filtering allowed this sort of vulnerability
	 - The DMZ network is a perimeter network that adds an extra layer of security between the internal network and untrusted traffic. It is typically separate from internal resources.
		 - As the DMZ monitors the flow of network traffic, the attacker being in control of it grants them full access to the information passed through the compromised network.
 - Kerberoasting attack to crack service account passwords on the domain
	 - Kerberoasting exploits a vulnerability in how Service Principal Names  (SPNs) and Ticket Granting Service (TGS) tickets are handled in the Kerberos protocol.

**General Scenario**:
 - Phishing campaign password harvest
 - MFA Fatigue
 - OpenVPN File in Email, VPN does not use MFA
 - RDP Access to hosts
 - Lack of egress filtering allows ssh tunneling to an attacker controlled DMZ
 - Kerberoasting attack allows for domain takeover

### What Needs to Change
 - Instead of just issuing a report, vendors need to provide more value by diagraming their vulnerability findings
 - Penetration testing results need to integrate into a continual improvement program
 - Learn how an attacker thinks to see the chain/graph traversal of vulnerabilities they need to perform
	 - A good attacker makes an even better defender
 - The basics are important:
	 - Whitelisting
	 - Asset/vulnerability management
	 - Least privilege policies
 - Anything that you can create a policy for is good, it creates a narrower funnel for detecting threats that matter
