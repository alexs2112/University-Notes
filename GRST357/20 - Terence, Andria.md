### Tragedy vs Comedy
 - Aristotle:
 - Tragedy entails the fall from walth, maybe even the death of a prominent character with whom we identify
 - Comedy is the complete reverse, assumption into wealth and prosperity of an individual with whom we don't quite identify. Instead of death there's liable to be a marriage.
	 - There doesn't have to be laughter.

	 - Following uncovering of affair between Pamphilus and Glycerium at Chrysis' funeral, the offer was withdrawn
 - Simo is outraged that Pamphilus does not feel abashed by his private admonition of his behaviour, continuing with the appearance of the nuptials so that he will be seen as publicly defying his father

 - Davus, hiding in the background, overhears Simo's plan and makes himself known
