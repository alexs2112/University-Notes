 - Eventually falls asleep after stopping some witches but gets away with it (black humour)
	 - Says he is happy to watch over the corpses of other family members if this happens again, the family is not happy with this and attacks him. Black humour, very short segment making fun of death in the family.
 - At the funeral, wife is accused of murder. Only solution is to bring the corpse back to life to testify. Magic, witchcraft, perhaps lust and greed. Transformation of the corpse, inversion as the funeral goes crazy.
 - Corpse denounces the wife. Attendees don't trust him. Proof as Thelyphorn (same name as the corpse) had his nose and ears nibbled by the witches and replaced by wax while he was sleeping. (Curiosity, Metamorphosis and Inversion)

### Book 4: 
**Part 1: The Robbers**
 - Travel south to Thebes, try to raid the houses there.
 - Lamachus the bandit commits suicide to avoid capture. Is this bravery and loyalty? What is moral behaviour?

 - Thrasyleon is disguised as a bear and lets the bandits into Diochares house. They rob this successfully and escape. Pursued, Thrasyleon delays the pursuers and is killed. Is this false honour, or just fun?

 - First three pages (68-71) are Charites story of her abduction, returned to in books 7 and 8.
 - Pages 71-76 is the beginning of the story of Cupid and Psyche
