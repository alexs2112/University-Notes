The concept of the Hero that is applied to Lucius can also be applied to Psyche. Her alienation matches Lucius, alienation from the divine and eternal.

### Philosophical Background
- Plato Symposium - Corporeal love leads to spiritual love which leads to a contemplation of love and beauty, these to a contemplation of God.
	- What the marriage of Cupid and Psyche is leading to
- Neoplationism - Uses the Platonic model to imagine how the individual human becomes linked to God. Earthly beauty + love mirrors the absolute beauty of God, can encourage in us a Love for God and the absolute.
	- Also what the marriage of Cupid and Psyche is leading to

### Book 4: Cupid and Psyche Part 1
 - Psyche is so beautiful that humans neglect the worship of Venus, becomes jealous and plans to punish Psyche through Cupid.
 - Psyche's sisters are jealous of her.
 - Psyche's father exposes Psyche on a crag to be assaulted by a monster
	 - Oracle tells him to get rid of her, make everybody happy again
	 - Rescued by the Zephyrs (winds from the west)

### Book 5: Cupid and Psyche Part 2
 - Psyche is left in the solitary palace with invisible servants and an invisible "husband"
 - At night, Cupid comes to her (invisible). For some reason she is in love with this invisible god
	 - Profane love, never met or seen him. No equality in their relationship, has to be mega lonely
 - So lonely, asks Cupid to let her see her sisters. Cupid warns her. Sisters are entertained, but departs very jealous
 - Cupid warns her, but allows her to see her sisters again. They tell her that she is married to a beast and has to murder her husband.
	 - Psyche seems to be enslaved to a corporeal love
 - Psyche is worried and curious (curiosity bad). Brings a torch so she can see him in his sleep, falls in love with him. Accidentally drips torch wax on Cupid and burns him.
	 - Curiosity, Lust, and Greed (from the sisters)
 - Cupid is woken up and freaks out, leaves her
	 - Crisis, alienation from the gods
 - Psyche begins to wander, meets Pan (and spurned Echo), visits one of her sisters' husbands. Her sisters try again to visit Psyche's palace but die (tricked by the zephyrs). Supposed to be a happy part of the book.
 - Psyche begins her wanderings, her love must become spiritual and not profane. Cupid takes center stage. A bird tells Venus about Cupid and Psyche, Venus asks June and Ceres to help her find Psyche

### Book 6: Cupid and Psyche Part 3
 - The whole book is a story about the triumph of Love over Death.
 - Wandering Psyche meets Ceres and is rebuffed, goes to the temple of Juno and is also rebuffed. She will surrender to Venus
 - Venus goes to Mercury for help. Venus finds Psyche and beats her, gives her a series of impossible tasks linked to life and death.
 - **Task 1**: Separating the grains, helped by ants (food)
 - **Task 2**: Bring back the golden wool (wealth)
 - **Task 3**: Water from the Styx in the underworld, helped by the eagle of Zeus (triumph over death)
 - **Task 4**: Go to Hades to collect a days worth of beauty from Proserpina, fails and faces suicide but is aided by a talking tower (death)
	 - Undoes the box of beauty to see what it is inside, fails the task (curiosity)
	 - Falls into a long long sleep and "dies"
		 - Everybody in the ancient world loves suicide for some reason, it is nearly impossible to do so as it is impossible to be on your own.
 - Cupid comes to the rescue, Psyche is saved and brought to heaven where a marriage feast is arranged.
 - The love is no longer corporeal/profane, has become sacred.
 - Psyche's alienation and wandering
