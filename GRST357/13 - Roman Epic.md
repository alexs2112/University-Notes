### What was an epic?
 - Traditionally, long poem in hexameter (six beat line) and about gods, heroes, and wars
 - The most popular form of narrative before the novel is developed
 - Traditional epic was very long, often very formal. This changed in Rome with the introduction of writing. Old epics were based on memory and recited orally (easier to memorize in verse)
	 - Never a clear cut break between the oral and the literate world

### Books
 - In Homer's time (750), illiteracy was almost universal
 - Literacy rate of Rome ~45%
 - There were libraries and bookstores (Library of Alexandria)
 - Many people could not read silently, libraries were loud places
 - If you had money, you probably had someone read to you
 - The size of stories were limited by the length of scrolls, ~1200 lines
 - Between Homer and Virgil, the size of a book probably shrank by half
 - Most people wouldnt read a poetry book longer than 15 books, probably preferred 12 books
 - Novels had to be shorter, maybe 4 rolls. Easier to fit more prose onto a roll
 - Epic had to be reinvented or the novil would push it aside
	 - Ovid and Vergil tried to reinvent the epic

### Other Epics
 - Traditionally, very long poem in hexameter about kings and battles
 - Also Hesiod, *Theogony* and *Works and Days* (1000 lines each)
 - Also the *Homeric Hymns* (400 lines)
 - Also a variety of didactic (teaching) poems, such as Hesiod or Virgils *Georgics*
 - Even pastoral poetry, about shepherds and their love affairs (Virgiles *Eclogues*)

### The Problems for Urban Epic Poetry
 - Need to combine the massive size of the traditional epic with the Alexandrian preference for small scale poetry
 - How do you create an epic hero, who is relevant for the urban, learned, and sophisticated world of Alexandria or Rome
 - If arete, time, and kleos are no longer relevant, then what is
 - How do you cater to the current interest in science and origins, and still stay true to the epic genre

### Four Types of Epic in Rome
 - A focus on **empire**: Livius, Naeius, Ennius, Virgil
 - A focus on **emotion** and on pathos: Ovid and Virgil
 - A focus on **evasion** - good and evil demarcated, nostalgia: Ovid
 - An adaptation of **polyphony** (empire, emotion, evasion): Virgil

### Ovid's Solution
 - Something called the miniature epic (epyllion). It is the same hexameter metre as epic, but usually only about 450 line slong
 - Some characteristics:
	 - Non-heroic
	 - Interested in emotions
	 - Focus on sexual relations
	 - Myth from an odd angle
	 - Short
	 - Often funny
 - Ovid attempts to blend the miniature epic with the traditional long epic. Produces one long narrative (15 books) that traces things from creation until the present (rule of emperor Augustus)
	 - Narrative has about 257 short epyllions within it
 - Favours the anti-hero
