### Seneca's Philosophy
 - Stoicism and Epicureanism
 - The Goal: Happiness is best gained by the middle way (bravery, love, self-control). Balancing and controlling your emotions
	 - Justice is procured from living according to this mode as well
	 - Not really a spectrum, just different emotions
```
	EXTREME    BALANCE       EXTREME
	Boldness   Bravery       Cowardice
	Rashness   Bravery       Fear
	Lust       Love          Indifference
	Anger      Self-control  Submission
	Glutton    Self-control  Abstinence
	Tyrant     Free Human    Slave
	Innocence  Guilt         Insensitivity   <- Not stoicism, Oedipus
```

### Medea
 - Wife/ex-wife of Jason
 - Jason leaves Medea for Creusa, daughter of King Creon
	 - Sees advantage in this political marriage
	 - Not being an actual citizen is a massive problem, marries into citizenship
 - Medea refuses to leave peacefully
	 - Sends poisoned robe as gift for Creusa on her wedding day (poisons, snake blood, herbs, invocations to underworld gods). Catches cursed fire, also killing Creon who tries to save her
	 - Sacrifices her children from the roof of her house in order to hurt Jason
	 - Eventually boils Jason to death
 - Jason ends the play by claiming there are no gods, otherwise such acts would not have been committed

### Why does Seneca use Mythology
 - Apuleius and Juvenal wrote about real life and daily life
 - So why myth?
	 - Everybody knows myth, so it speaks to people everywhere
	 - Tends to be more dignified and serious
	 - Normal subject for tragedy in the theater

### Medea: Structure
 - Introduction, Medea curses Creusa and King Creon
 - Medea, Nurse, Creon: Creon gives Medea one day to leave Corinth
 - Jason and Medea argue, she begs him to go with her from Corinth
 - Medea prepares the poisoned robe for Creusa
 - Medea is like a Maenad, a Colchian monster
 - Messenger describes Creusa's death, Medea kills her children as Jason watches helplessly

### Difference between the two plays
 - **Euripides**: Medea is not concerned with love, but with betrayal and lack of loyalty from Jason
	 - By betraying her, Jason becomes her enemy (do good to your friends and harm to your enemies)
 - **Seneca**: The old code no longer applies. Medea still wants her husband and her marriage intact.
	 - Still seems to love Jason, jealous rage in the opening of the play
