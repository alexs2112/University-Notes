 - Don't aspire for too much, you might regret what you get
 - Seems to offer a narrator who is much closer to the "author" and the narrator perhaps tells us too much
 - Apuleius tells you nothing, it is all implied

### Structure
 - Wealth often destroys
 - It is all too easy to fall from power - like Sejanus. The mob follows Fortuna and cares for nothing but bread and circuses
	 - By seeking even more honors and power, Sejanus just makes his eventual fall that much more terrible
	 - Being a great orator like Demosthenes or Cicero may get one killed
 - Lust for military glory has ruined countries, time will destroy the graves of even the most famous generals
	 - Hannibal died of poison in exile
	 - Alexander left in a coffin
	 - Xerxes crawled back to Persia after failing in Greece
 - Long life just means ugliness, helplessness, impotence, and the loss of all pleasure
	 - Old people are deaf and full of diseases, dementia was the worst of all
	 - Old people just live to see the funerals of their children and loved ones (Nestor, Priam)
	 - Men would be thought fortunate to die before a late disaster overtook them (Croesus, Marius, Pompey)
 - Beauty is inimical to a person's virtue, even if untouched by corruption, makes them objects of lust for perverts
 - Beautiful men tend to become noted adulterers, risking their lives
	 - Even unwilling, Hippolytus, wrath of scorned women may destroy them
 - It is to be prayed that the mind be sound in a sound body
