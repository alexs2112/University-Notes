### Seneca - Medea
 - Euripides: Medea driven by an aristocratic code, **not jealousy**, when she kills Jason's to-be wife and her own children
 - Seneca is interested in the idea that Medea is jealous
	 - Sexual jealousy is not normally depicted in ancient Rome as marriage is arranged
 - For Seneca, it seems as though he is writing for theater, although he doesn't seem to really use the stage in his writings
