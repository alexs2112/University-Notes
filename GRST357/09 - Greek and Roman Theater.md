### Seneca - Medea
 - Euripides: Medea driven by an aristocratic code, **not jealousy**, when she kills Jason's to-be wife and her own children
 - Seneca is interested in the idea that Medea is jealous
	 - Sexual jealousy is not normally depicted in ancient Rome as marriage is arranged
 - For Seneca, it seems as though he is writing for theater, although he doesn't seem to really use the stage in his writings

### Aristotle's Key Contribution to Understanding Tragedy
 - **Reversal**: The loss of position, wealth, and even life
 - **Recognition**: That you played a part in your downfall
 - **Catharsis**: The audience feels a strange, tragic exaltation
 - The tragic hero should be sufficiently like us so that we can identify with their fall, with such stature that their fall seems all themore affecting
 - Seneca changes the model, more interested in "negative examples", individuals that we don't identify with and have wicked character traits
	 - Learn from their egregious faults
