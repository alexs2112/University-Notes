### Plautus
 - History:
	 - Born in Umbria
	 - Moved to Rome
	 - Became an actor (playing Maccius in *Fabulae Atellanae*, simple gluttonous fool)
	 - So successful financially decided to go into business, lost all his money.
		 - Supposedly took a job at a mill and used his spare time to write plays
	 - Wrote between 205 and 184 BCE
 - Plays apparently written to amuse, rather than to grind some political or philosophical axe
 - Reflect Italian popular comedy, as well as the influence of Greek New Comedy (Menander)
 - All of his characters pretend to be Greek (*fabulae palliatae*)
 - The plays are usually set in the Greek world, often Athens
 - Enjoys spoofing the "Greek" tone of the plays
 - Characters often act, talk, and think as Romans
	 - Consider the Greeks effeminate and degenerate
	 - In *Mostellaria*, insult each other as Romans might:
		 - Drink with your friends all day and night, act like a Greek
		 - Drink, eat your fancy Greek food
		 - He's been eating and drinking, having women in the house, behaving like a Greek - flute-girls, musicians brought in
 - 130 plays attributed to Plautus in antiquity (never stopped writing)
 - 21 survived in the manuscript tradition
 - *Fabulae palliata*: Plays where the characters wore the Greek cloak called *pallium*
 - Adapted more or less creatively from Greek originals, at least follow in the tradition of Greek New Comedy, already more than a century old
 - Plautus' comedies, like Menander before him, usually include a prologue where a character would introduce the audience to the main characters, background, sometimes its conclusion
	 - *Mostellaria* notable for its lack of a prologue
 - Poetry & Music
	 - Dialogue/recitative
		 - Stchomythia: dialogue with short lines
	 - Full arias: cantica, main characters often burst into song
	 - Double pipe, perhaps percussion
	 - Slapstick
