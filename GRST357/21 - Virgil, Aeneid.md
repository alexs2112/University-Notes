### Overview
 - Blends together the Odyssey (1-6) and the Illiad (7-12)
 - Focuses on the establishment of Empire
 - Wrote under Augustus, adopted nephew of Julius Caesar (believed lineage under Venus)
 - Wrote 1 line per day, massive amount of control over the text
 - Shows a string of characters in Roman history to show the reestablishment of the Roman Empire under Augustus
	 - Pythagoras, Hercules, Aeneas, Romulus, Julius Caesaer

### Four Types of Epic in Rome
 - A focus on **empire**: Livius, Naeius, Ennius, Virgil
 - A focus on **emotion** and on pathos: Ovid and Virgil
 - A focus on **evasion** - good and evil demarcated, nostalgia: Ovid
 - An adaptation of **polyphony** (empire, emotion, evasion): Virgil

### Simple Ideas of the Aeneid
 - *Control versus Lack of Control*
 - Pietas versus Furor
 - Jupiter versus Juno, Venus
 - Rome versus Carthage
 - Calm versus Storm (p4-8)

### Aeneid 4 (Dido and Aeneas)
 - Meeting in the cave
 - Dido's remonstration, Aeneas begins to leave her
	 - On a mission to reestablish Troy as the new Roman Empire
 - Dido's death by suicide

### Aeneid 5

 - Lugestes campi and Dido
 - Anchises meeting with Aeneas
 - Anchises and reincarnation
	 - Theory that links Aeneas to Augustus and the past to the present
 - Anchises and destiny (another version of pythagoras)
 - Gates of Horn

### Polyphony
1. Public: Empire - Anchises advice in 6, Shield in Aeneid 8
2. Private: Loss - Dido, Pallas, Lausus, Creusa, Turnus?
3. Ludic: Cacus in Aeneid 8
 - Is it a balancing act (polyphony) or does one voice win?

### Aeneid 7 (Much Furor and Little Pietas)
 - Trojans arrive, meet King Latinus
	 - Prophecy for the daughter to marry a foreigner?
 - Juno and Allecto start a war
	 - Juno hates the Trojans (lost a beauty contest when Troy was founded)
		 - Paris accepted Venus' bribe of Helen (Athena, Juno also tried to bribe him)
	 - Lots of snake imagery, fire imagery
	 - Allecto used to give fury to important people on both sides, make them want to start a war
 - Turnus, who do we support
 - Opening the Gate of War
 - Long catalogue of Italian heroes, dividing up heroes between the sides of the war

### Aeneid 8 (Visit to the future site of Rome)

### Aeneid 9 (Aeneas "Wanderings")
 - Day 1: Trojans beseiged by Turnus
 - Night: Nisus and Euryalis, old-style heroism that Aeneas is leaving behind
	 - Furor, heroic impulse (driven by older form of bravery, not relevant to the "current" world)
	 - Going to the Latinian camp,  kill a bunch of people

	 - Death of Lausus and Mezentius

### Aeneid 11 (Burying of the Dead)

	 - Turnus gets his own sword back, Aeneas recovers his spear, they confront each other again
	 - Interlude: Juno and Jove and the bird of death, Juturna departs, will no longer interfere with Turnus and fate has settled on what has to happen
		 - Juno yields to Jupiter's order to cease interference, begs that Latins may keep their culture and not become Trojans
	 - Final encounter: Turnus is defeated, not spared by Aeneas
		 - Turnus attempts to throw a huge rock at Aeneas, fails without godly strength. Aeneas hurls his spear and wounds him
		 - Turnus begs for mercy, Aeneas is on the point of granting it when he catches sight of the belt of Pallas, in fury and anger he kills him
