### Plot Similarities
 - Purchase of the courtesan is what starts the story, Philolaches owes the money lender and Hero falls in love with the courtesan that has been purchased by another man.
 - Quick witted slave repeatedly complicates the situation by needing to answer to the other characters.
 - Just a day in Roman life, mundane plot points with no gods or heroes.
 - Confusion between everybody who is not the main slave.
 - The plots are under a time limit. The movie needs to be resolved before the soldier Miles arrives to marry Philia. Plautus' play needs to be resolved before Theopropides finds out about Tranio's deception.
 - Both Pseudolus and Tranio are threatened with punishment before being saved by a surprise revelation at the end.

### Plot Dissimilarities
 - The courtesan is the most important conflict in the movie, Plautus merely uses it as an explanation for the main conflict in his play (the moneylender)
 - Senex is reactive towards the plot, only after Philia once she thinks he is her new owner.
 - Theopropides is a much larger character, driving the plot forwards as Tranio tries to protect Philolachus by repeatedly deceiving his father.
 -  The main antagonist in the movie is Miles, the main antonist in the play is Theopropides.

### Character Similarities
 - Pseudolus and Tranio are very clever and drive the plot forwards.
 - Hero and Philolachus are both in love with the courtesan and are the cause of the slaves needing to deceive everybody else.

### Main Themes of Plautus
