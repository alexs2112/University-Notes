### Juvenal
 - Author of series of semi-realistic poems known as the *Satires* (55-140  CE)
 - Wrote at least 16 poems in dactylic hexameter, covering a range of Roman topics
 - Have bits of everything in them, similarly to Apuleius
 - Variety of perspective, but comic mode of expression makes it problematic to accept the content as strictly factual

### Grouping the Satires into Books
 1. Satires 1-5
 2. Satire 6
 3. Satires 7-9
 4. Satires 10-12
 5. Satires 13-16
 - The books are formed as scrolls, more convenient this way
 - Satire 16 is incompletely preserved
 - Given a farm due to popularity around satire 10, begines moralizing and becoming more abstract/philosophical

### What is Satire?
 - A genre  of literature in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, usually through exaggeration and overstatement
 - Unreliable narrators, the narrator should not be confused with the author

### Characteristics of Roman Literature
 - Unreliable narrator (new thing from before)
 - Digression (frame narrative, inset, tale within tale)
 - Odd narrative thread
 - Black Humor
 - Taste for the macabre
 - Exuberant/Exaggerated, flamboyant
 - Concrete
 - Power
 - Unsentimental

### Juvenal's Logic
 - Division between the Past and the Present
 - **Past**
	 - Good
	 - Poor
	 - Mono-cultural
	 - Frugal
	 - Country
	 - Freedom
	 - Truth
	 - Chastity
	 - Religion
	 - Roman
 - **Present**
	 - Bad
	 - Rich/Venal
	 - Multicultural
	 - Greed
	 - City
	 - Tyranny
	 - Slavery
	 - Falsehood
	 - Lust
	 - False-Religion
	 - Greek
 - The logic of the narrator, can't trust the narrators so we can't say this is how Juvenal thought.

### Satire 3: Structure
 - Introduction: Umbricius is leaving Rome, too chaotic and corrupt to live in
 - He explains:
	 - Inversion of the normal order of things in Rome
	 - Greeks push aside the poor in Rome (greed)
	 - Wealthy - often ex-slaves or slaves (lust)
	 - City housing (Greek present) compared to country housing (Roman past)
	 - Rome at night, insomnia, night-time traffic, falling tiles
	 - Explains later on night, assaulted by the bully (black humor?)
	 - Conclusions, a final complaint about Rome and praise of the country
 - Was Rome really as bad as Umbricius says? The text is full of impatience, anger, prejudice

### Satire 4: The Roman Emperor
 - This poem is an attack on the emperor Domitian
 - Would torture and put people in jail who mocked his lack of hair
	 - His official statue had hair added to it
 - Ridicules the emperor and his court in a mock-epic tale of a fish so prodigious that it was fit for the emperor alone
 - Council of state is called to deal with crisis of how to cook it
	 - Fish can't be cooked by conventional means due to its size, nor can it be cut into pieces
 - Main themes are corruption, incompetence of sycophantic courtiers, unwillingness/inability to speak truth to power

### Structure
 - Intro: Corrupt Crispinus buys a 60-pound mullet for 60 gold pieces
	 - Crispinus isn't described very well, kind of a POS
 - Reminded of historical referent: A giant turbot caught at Ancona, too big for anyone else to eat, needs to be given to the emperor as he is the most important person
	 - A little far from Rome, need to preserve it through the mountains
 - Fish presented to the emperor Domitian
 - Imperial councilors Pegasus and Crispus ponder the problem
 - Acilius comes next and his condemned son
 - Five more councilors (Rubrius, Montanus, Fuscus, Veiento, Catullus)
	 - These were all real councilors, important people
	 - Argue about how to cook the fish
		 - Would be an insult to cut it up, need to cook it whole
 - Montanus suggests that a casserole large enough to cook the fish needs to be bought
	 - Need the best potter in rome to create the biggest cooking pot known to rome
 - The council breaks up, narrator voices his wish that all the actions of Dominitian had been so meaningless
