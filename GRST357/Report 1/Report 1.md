### Does Beauty and the Beast echo Cupid and Psyche?
 - **Write an introduction** (150 words)
The story of *Beauty and the Beast* echoes Apuleius' story of *Cupid and Psyche*. However, the plot present in both stories is general enough that the echo is coincidental, not deliberate. Both stories feature a woman protagonist in either Beauty or Psyche, main characters that are distinct in their beauty and pure of heart. The jealousness of the outside world causes the initial crisis for both characters, leading their fathers to give them up as a sacrifice seeking the preservation of their family. These stories are resolved through the reconciliation between Beauty with the Beast and Psyche with Cupid, ending in love and union. The most striking difference between these two stories is the presence of Venus as a prime antagonist for Psyche. Beating her and forcing her into a series of impossible tasks that end in her death. Beauty has no such major adversary, indicating that the echoes between the stories are not intentional.
