### The Sun: Characteristics
 - Radiates energy due to the continuous thermonuclear reactions at its interior (fusion)
 - The thermonuclear reactions combine atoms of hydrogen to form helium
 - The lifecycle of a star depends on how long its "hydrogen reserve" lasts
 - Accounts for approx 98.8% of the total `mass` of the solar system
 - `Diameter:` ~1.5 million km
 - `Chemical Composition:` Hydrogen: ~73%, Helium ~25%, minor elements
 - `Temperature` at the interior of the sun: ~20 million degrees Celsius

### Planetary Classification:
 - Terrestrial:
	 - Small, rocky surface, thin atmosphere. Largely the closest to the sun
	 - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars
 - Jovian:
	 - Larger, gaseous in appearance, thick atmosphere
	 - Notable, all of them present rings
	 - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
 - Icy:
	 - Small, most distant group of planets, covered with a thick layer of ice
	 - Pluto

### Terrestrial Planets
 - Generally small
 - Extremely high density
 - Earth has the highest density in the solar system
 - Small number of satellites
 - General architecture of their interior:
	 - Molten core dominated by metals
	 - Another layer (can be separated into mantle/crust, or a single layer) dominated by silicates

### The Moon
 - The only *natural satellite* of the Earth
 - Its diameter is `3475 km`, approx 1/4 of the Earth's diameter
 - One of the largest satellites in the Solar System
 - Consists of `highlands` (terrae) and `depression regions` (marae)
 - Surface shows numerous craters, document the existence of a severe meteorite bombardment in it's history
 - Was once molten, slowly formed a crust (incipient crust, early crust) in space. This crust was hit by large asteroids, reshaping the moon to form craters that is flush with the rest of the surface
	 - Asteroids can no longer pass through the crust, so they form craters that are not flush with the surface

### Jovian Planets
 - All of them have a core consisting of a mixture of silicates and metals
 - The core is approximately the size of the terrestrial planets
 - As you get closer to the interior, the gases are transformed from a gaseous state to a liquid state due to the high pressure.
	 - Jupiter, at its core, is a layer of metallic hydrogen
 - Still dominated by hydrogen and helium
 - Much bigger than the terrestrial planets. The smallest, Neptune, is approximately 4 times larger than the earth
 - Density is much smaller than the terrestrial planets
 - All contain rings and many natural satellites
	 - Io (Jupiter) is one of three bodies in the solar system with volcanic activity (plus Earth and Triton)
	 - Europa (Jupiter) has a surface covered with ice, can probably host incipient forms of life in the oceans below the ice

### Asteroids
 - A huge number of celestial bodies, very small with irregular shape.
 - Known as flying mountains
 - Phobos and Deimos, the moons of Mars, are simply asteroids captured in Mars' orbit
	 - We believe they were formed by the explosion of an ancient protoplanet

### Meteorites
 - Represent fragments of rocks from the interplanetary space which collide with planets
 - The source of these fragments can be other collisions in the interplanetary space of the Solar System
 - Mostly silicates and metals (predominately iron, some nickel, then others)
 - Chondrules are quasi-spherical structures, indicate solidification from molten droplets splashed during collisions between various celestial bodies
 - Subdivided according to their composition:
	 - **Chondritic/Stony Meteorites**
		 - Are the most frequent
		 - Dominated by silicates
		 - Most of them present chondrules
			 - If they don't have chondrules, called Achondrites
			 - If they have traces of organic matter (amino acids) Carbonatious Chondrites
	 - **Iron**
		 - Dominated by iron-nickel alloys
	 - **Stony-Iron**
		 - Very rare, equal parts iron and silicates

### Space Dust
 - Cosmic dust, exists both in interplanetary and interstellar space
 -  Consists of small sized particles
	 - Mostly Carbon, Magnesium, Iron, and Calcium
 - Estimated that approximately 3000 tons of space dust fall on Earth each year
	 - Gradual increase in size
