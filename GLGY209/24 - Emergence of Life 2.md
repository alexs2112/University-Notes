### Stromatolites
 - Circular fossils, claimed to be result of organisms but couldn't prove what organism did it
	 - *Cryptozoon* (hidden organisms)
 - Another discovery of cryptozoon structurs at Schreiber Beach in the late 50s
	 - Around the structures, could see the desseminated organic matter (origin unrecognizable)
	 - Within the cryptozoon structures, could see organic columns
	 - Used magnification up to several thousand times, within these structures could see fossilized precariates (?)
		 - All of a sudden precariates fossils were being noticed everywhere
		 - Extremely diverse: Precariant diversification
 - Stromatolites prefer warmer waters, column-like structures situated between tidal zones (center of low and high tide), harsh conditions
	 - Able to figure out the cryptozoons are simply stromatolites
 - Stromatolites are only alive in the uppermost portion, underneath is dead rock
	 - Indicates a vast history in time
 - The study of modern stromatolites showed there are four distinct zones
	 - Sorted from surface towards center
	 - **Growth Surface**: (1mm) Thin layer, highest diversity of organisms, bacteria, cyanobacteria, don't need oxygen to develop their life cycle, produce oxygen, some are photosynthetic
	 - **Undermat**: (1mm) Thin bacterial layer, consisting of non-oxygen producing photosynthetic bacteria, and anaerobic (no oxygen) bacteria that can still use oxygen when available. Amount of bacteria drops off sharply from the growth surface.
	 - **Oxygen-Depleted Zone**: (1-2 cm) Thicker layer, populated by rare anaerobic bacteria
	 - **Stromatolite Mass**: Includes most of the stromatoite, consists of calcium carbonate. No living bacteria and cyanobacteria in this portion of the stromatolite
 - By the neoarchean period, stromatolites achieved global domination. Were everywhere, every river, stream, ocean
	 - Up until this point, stromatolites slowly accumulated around the globe (paleoarchean to end of mesoarchean)
		 - Pre paleoarchean, no stromatolites
	 - Stromatolites began to reduce in numbers at the start of the Phanerozoic
		 - A group of organisms evolved that were capable of feeding on stromatolites
		 - Entered a period of decline, returned to the patchy distribution. Mostly in salty lagoons, toxic for gastropods (predator of stromatolites)

### Banded Iron Formation - BIF
 - Another kind of sedimentary rock in Isua formation
 - Consists of an alternance of thin (millimeters-centimetes in thickness) of iron oxides (hematite, magnetite, etc) and layers consisting of cherts and jaspers (lower iron content)
 - Layers of reddish rust between layers of greys and greens
 - Combined with oxygen in the atmosphere, and oxygen in the water
 - Can tell that the Earth's atmosphere transformed from reducing to oxygen filled at this period
	 - A challenging period for life on Earth, most organisms were anaerobic and oxygen was toxic to them
	 - First mass extinction, organisms destroyed by their product (oxygen)

### Oldest Eukaryotes
 - Oldest Eukaryotes are biomarkers (chemical fossils), evolution from Precariates
 - First organisms capable of sexual reproduction, not mitotic reproduction
	 - The mutations and imperfections from sexual reproduction leads to more evolution
