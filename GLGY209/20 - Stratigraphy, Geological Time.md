### Steno's Principles
 - Published a book (1665) that revolutionized science
 - Observations in Tuscany, returned to live in Denmark, converted to Roman Catholicism, wrote 28 books of religion, beatified by the pope and turned into a saint
 - Using these principles, they became very efficient at finding coal
 - Eventually (1740), creationism mostly vanished in science due to studying the layers and layers of the Earth, indicative of Earth's age
1. **Principle of Layer Superposition**
	- Time of formation of the first layer (succession of layers), newly added layers gradually occupy higher places in the succession. Therefore, an undisturbed stratigraphical succession of layers, the oldest layer is at the bottom and the youngest layer at the top.
2. **Principle of Layer Successive Formation**
	- Some layers have fossils in their formation, none of the fossils present traces of the soft body
	- Correctly indicated that the transformation of a creature into a fossil took a long time
	- Thinking at that time that a layer formed in about 5 or 6 years
		- At least 10000 layers in the succession of layers in Tuscany, at least 50k years
	- Disproves some of the bible, first sign of split between science and the church, although they still worked together at this time
3. **Principle of Original Layer Horizontality**
	- Originally, layers were horizontal, but in outcrops they are folded
	- The new form is the result of crustal movements
4. **Principle of Lateral Layer Continuity**
	- Considered layers of the rivers, when a layer is formed it is formed over the entire surface of the basin
	- Does not hold all the time, technically not a principle (sediment deposits from rivers in the ocean, creates new layers that don't go everywhere)

### Layer & Facies Terminations
 - 5 cases to demonstrate how layers are ordered in the Earth's crust
 - In France, these writings were hidden away by the church
 - More writings, church also hid them away, messed with the wrong guy
	 - These ones demonstrated that the Earth's age was 70-80k years, immediately rejected in England as nobody believed the Earth was that young
	 - Never claimed he was true, used these writings as a way to remove creationism from science
