### Oldest Eukaryotes
 - Oldest Eukaryotes are biomarkers (chemical fossils), evolution from Prokaryotes
	 - According to fossils, evolved 1.8 billion years ago
	 - Some other records, closer to 2.1 billion years
 - First organisms capable of sexual reproduction, not mitotic reproduction
	 - The mutations and imperfections from sexual reproduction leads to more evolution

### Bitter Springs Formation
 - Australia
 - First isolated true eukaryote cells discovered in the cherts here (central Australia)
	 - Dated 1.0 billion years
 - Assigned to the red algae (rhodophytes) and green algae (chlorophytes, Caryosphaeroides and Glenobotrydion)
 - Some of these were caught in the process of cellular division, among the very few cases where even the nucleus and cell membrane were fossilized
	 - Cell arrangement suggests meiotic cell division
	 - Offspring cell unique arrangement during the cellular division indicates that the organisms belong to the eukaryote
	 - Such arrangements not found among the prokaryotes

### Eukaryotes - Examples
- **Bangiomorpha**
	- Evolution of multicellular organisms
	- Filamentous thallus, similar to those of modern red algae
	- Primitive holdfast attached to the seafloor, allowing the alga to rise upwards towards the sunlight
	- ~1.2 billion years
	- Proterozoic - Quaternary
- **Torridonophycus**
	- Algal (green) microstructures escaping from a bag-like structure, which helpted them survive the dry climate
		- In a stress period, creates a protective structure
	- Chlorophyte
	- ~0.9 billion years
	- Upper Proterozoic - Quaternary
 - **Melanocyrillium**
	 - Show similarities with the modern group of testate amoebas
		 - Included among the earliest animals
		 - Vase looking mf, wide at the bottom with an open top
			 - Extensions of the cytoplast emerged from the opening to catch food
			 - Animal-like metabolism
	 - Organic, somtimes with agglutinated particles
	 - ~0.8-0.9 billion years
	 - Upper Proterozoic - Quaternary
