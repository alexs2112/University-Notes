### Silicate Structure
 - One atom of silicon, covalently bonded to four atoms of oxygen. The oxygen atoms leave 1 valence electron open

### Silicate Mineral Groups - Terminology
 - Six silicate mineral groups, defined according to how tetrahedra link with each other and other cations
 - Tetrahedra are also Silicates
	 - Isolated Tetrahedra: Neosilicates
	 - Single Chain Tetrahedra: Inosilicates
	 - Double Chain Tetrahedra: Sorosilicates
	 - Sheet Tetrahedra: Phyllosilicates
	 - Ring Tetrahedra: Cyclosilicates
	 - Framework Tetrahedra: Tectosilicates

### Isolated Silicates/Tetrahedra (Nesosilicates)
 - Tetrahedra are linked by cations (eg: Fe (2+), Mg (2+))
 - No shared electrons in the tetrahedra oxygen atoms
 - Simplest structure, the most frequent minerals on Earth
 - Examples: 
	 - Topaz, Zircon (formed in a variety of environments, requires vast amount of water)
	 - **Olivine** (on test, most frequent mineral on Earth)

### Single Chain Silicates/Tetrahedra (Inosilicates)
 - Single covalent chains, ionically bonded to each other by metals
	 - Chains of the silicates, those chains are ionically (weakly) bonded to each other by metal cations
	 - Tough in a direction perpendicular to the covalent chains, weak in the other direction with the ionic bonds
	 - Elongated prism shape due to this structure
 - Cations can be Fe2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, etc
 - Examples:
	 - Diopsid, Spodumen, Richterite
	 - Don't need to memorize minerals of this group

### Double Chain Silicates/Tetrahedra (Sorosilicates)
 - There are two or three shared oxygens in any Si-O tetrahedron
 - The double chains are bonded by cations
 - Very tough in a direction perpendicular to the chain structures, very weak in a direction parallel with them
 - Relatively rare in nature, not rock-forming minerals
 - Examples:
	 - Epidot, Axinite, Bertrandite
	 - Don't need to memorize minerals of this group

### Sheet Chain Silicates/Tetrahedra (Phyllosilicates)
 - Silica tetrahedra present three shared oxygen atoms
 - Form a plane, the planes are bonded by cations
 - Extremely tough in a direction perpendicular to the plane structure, extremely weak in a direction parallel to them
 - Examples:
	 - Phlogopite, Pyrophyllite
	 - **Biotite** (should be memorized, very flaky, aka black mica, relatively frequent)
		 - Black micas formed by the crystallization of the magmas from the deeper portions of the Earth (white micas form closer to the Earth's surface)
		 - Memorize both minerals of the mica type, black mica is representative of formation in the deeper portion of the Earth, **Muscovite** (??? check spelling) or white mica is representative of formation closer to the Earth's surface
	 - Very diverse in form

### Framework Silicates/Tetrahedra (Tectosilicates)
 - All four oxygen atoms are bonded with covalent bonds
 - The framework is three dimensional
 - Covalent bonds everywhere, these structures are weirdly some of the most flexible minerals due to impurities that force the crystal structure to adapt
 - Examples:
	 - Albite, Sodalite
	 - **Quartz** (memorize), very important, go through multiple rock cycles at the surface of the Earth under atmosphere, water, and biogenical forces, and remain intact
		 - One of the most stable minerals on Earth

### Ring Silicates/Tetrahedra (Cyclosilicates)
 - The ring silicates share two oxygen atoms in the Si-O tetrahedra to form rings of 3,4, or 6 tetrahedra
 - Relatively rare minerals, do not occur in proportions greater than 1% of a rocks mass when they do occur
 - Examples:
	 - Dioptas, Beryl, Tourmaline
	 - Extremely rare, do not need to memorize
