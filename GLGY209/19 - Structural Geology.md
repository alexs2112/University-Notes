### Rock Response to Force and Stress
 - **Force**: The push or pull that result in a change in the motion of a physical body of a given mass
 - **Stress**: The amount of force per unit area
 - Causes displacement, rotation, strain

### Kinds of Stress
 - Confining Stress
	 - Stress forces all equivalently pushing inwards, doesn't move, very stable
 - Differential Stress:
	 - Applied differently in different directions
	 - **Compression** (pushes on rock)
	 - **Tension** (stretches the rock)
	 - **Shear** (applied in two opposite directions)

### Crustal Structures
 - Two major categories:
	 - **Folds** (result of ductile deformation)
	 - **Faults** (result of brittle deformation, breaks crustal cohesion)
 - Their formation depends on how the layers of rocks behave to the applied force
 - Forces moving inwards, wrinkling the crust

### Kinds of Folds
 - Anticlines
	 - Two branches converge upwards, forming a pointed shape
	 - Classification function of the limb and axial plane position with respect to the horizontal plane
 - Synclines
	 - Two branches converge downwards, forming a valley shape
 - Monoclines
	 - Weaker crustal forces, not strong enough to form two branches/limbs
	 - Layer only slightly tilted, one single branch

### Crustal Stuctures: Faults
 - When the fracture happens in a crustal layer, it can be followed by movement
 - When no movement happens, called a joint
 - When there is movement, it is a fault
 - Three categories of a fault:
	 - Strike-slip fault: Horizontal movement
	 - Dip-slip fault: Vertical movement
	 - Oblique-slip fault: Both horizontal and vertical displacement (most common)
 - Three categorizations (see below):
	 - Reverse faults are caused by collision
	 - Thrust faults are practically reverse faults, at a small angle (2-5 degrees, very rarely up to 20 degrees), hanging wall moves a very long distance compared to the foot wall
