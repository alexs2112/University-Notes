### Modern View
 - By fossils, we generally understand any evidence of ancient life forms
 - **Fossil**: Older than 11000 years
 - **Subfossil**: Younger than 11000 years
 - A way to divide between paleontology and archeology

### Kinds of Fossils
 - **Body Fossils**: Direct or altered remains of ancient organisms (teeth, shells, tests, etc)
	 - Paleontology
 - **Trace Fossils (ichnofossils)**: Evidence of the activity of ancient organisms
	 - Sedimentary Petrology
 - **Chemical Fossils (biomarkers)**: Organic compounds produced by various organisms, found in strata (very stable compounds that can linger for 4 billion years, requires a mass spectrometer)
	 - Geochemistry

### Kinds of Fossil Preservation
 - Recrystallization
 - Moldic preservation of mold-cast preservation
 - Perminerallization
 - Carbonization
 - Congealment
 - Fossilization in amber
 - Fossilization in tar pits
 - There are others, these are the main ones

### Recrystallization
 - Process of conversion of the original minerals of the test into a different mineral
 - Most common transformation during the process is that from `aragonite` to `calcite`
	 - Aragonite and Calcite are two carbonates (CaCO3) but with different crystal structures

### Moldic Preservation
 - The original test or shell is dissolved
	 - Example: Gastropod, shape of the former organism is given b the lithified sediment infill
		 - Buried in sediment, subjected to bacterial decay (or small insects/worms), soft tissue will vanish, leaves behind a shell of aragonite that then transforms into calcite
		 - Extremely reactive minerals, subterranean fluids (hot, rich in chemicals) will make their way in and dissolve the original shell, however the rock outside of it stays rigid
		 - `Mold` is the stone left inside of the outer `Cast`
 - Molds are left by the organism, original organic material is dissolved

### Moldic Preservation - Replacement
- A particular case of moldic (mold and cast) preservation
- The space resulting from the dissolution of the original test is filled by a new material
- Pyritization is the most frequent (and spectacular) case of replacement

### Permineralization
 - Hard body parts with pores (ex: tree trunk, vertebrate bones)
 - Results from the filling of these pore spaces usually by opal or chalcedony (SiO2)

### Carbonization
 - A kind of fossilization often met in plants and algae, also in fishes
 - Occurs when the fossils are buried deep into the Earth's crust, all organic material is expelled except for carbon
 - These fossils have a blackish appearance

### Congealment
 - This kind of fossilization occurs at high altitudes
 - Thick layer of frozen soil and rock at the uppermost of the Earth's crust (permafrost)
 - Moisture at the surface can form frozen swamps, trapping animals within
	 - Dont eat the 40000 year old meat

### Fossilization in Amber
 - A natural resin, allows three dimensional fossilization of the organisms caught while it is still liquid (high viscosity)

### Fossilization in Tar Pits
 - Toxic swamps formed at the surface of the Earth
 - Hydrocarbons from the Earths interior (oil, natural gas) make it to the Earth's surface, highly toxic natural oil and methane
 - Organisms that get close are trapped
