### Generalities
 - Not molten and recrystallized
 - Changes of the preexisting rocks during the metamorphic process are:
	 - **Textural**
		 - Relative development of some minerals with respect to the others
	 - **Mineralogical**
		 - Chemically reactive fluids travelling through rocks and fractures, coming in contact with existing minerals, changing their chemical composition
	 - **Both**
		 - Most common

### Necessity of Changes
 - Changes during the metamorphic process is due to rocks having the trend to remain in equilibrium with the surrounding environment
 - Changes to the environment also change the rocks
 - Example: Transformation from limestone into marble involves rock recrystallization under heat under many years

### Limits of the Metamorphism
 - Metamorphic changes are made while the rocks remain under the solid state
 - Doesn't always happen (migmatite, result from when metamorphosis between Granite and Gneiss is messed up)

### Importance of Metamorphic Rock Study
 - Metamorphic rocks exposed at the Earth's surface provide a window into different levels into the Earth's crust
 - Allows for understanding of how the crust behaves and changes in different geologic environments
 - Economic significance

### Types of Metamorphism
 - 8 main types, only cover 3 of them in this course
 - **Barrovian/Regional Metamorphism**
	 - Metamorphism in the zone of the mountain ranges
	 - Metamorphism in the area between two plates (huge pressure)
 - **Buchan/Contact Metamorphism**
	 - Deeper portions of the crust, when molten matter is injected (process of solidification is not linear, is fractional)
	 - Dominant rocks are marbles
 - **Burial Metamorphism**
	 - A very thick pile of sediments, as more sediments are added, the older ones are buried and experience higher heat and pressure

### Grades of Metamorphism
 - Low Grade: You can tell it is still the original rock, a little transformed
 - Medium Grade: The transformation is more apparent
 - High Grade: You cannot practically recognize the original rock from which they formed (migmatite)
 - Diagram below

### Metamorphic Rock Textures
 - New textures are developed during the metamorphism through two processes
 - **Recrystallization**: Minerals change chemical+mineralogical composition, and size
 - **Foliation**: Minerals realign, causing different structures. Parallel alignment of minerals in the rocks, resulting in a layered appearance

### Major Classes of Textures
 - Two main textural classes of metamorphic rocks:
 - **Foliated**: Contains nearly parallel strips of other minerals, present preferential orientation (aka *schistose*)
 - **Non-Foliated (Granoblastic)**: Don't have the strips

### Rock Cleavage
 - Describes the tendency of a rock to break along parallel or sub-parallel surfaces
 - It reflects textural alignment of mineral grains, or subparallel arrangement of discontinuities
 - As the rocks are buried, we see transitions as the minerals layer themselves
 - Kinds of Cleavage and Foliation, in order of burial and complexity:
 - **Slaty Cleavage**:
	 - Includes rocks with the lowest degree of transformation, shallow conditions
	 - Still recognize the original arrangement of the minerals, can frequently see fossils
	 - **Dominant type of cleavage**
	 - Low Grade Metamorphic Rocks
 - **Phyllite Cleavage**:
	 - A tendency to lose the original foliation
	 - Originate through the metamorphic changes of the very fine sedimentary rocks
	 - More prominent metamorphic transformation
	 - Medium Grade Metamorphic Rocks
 - **Schistose Cleavage**:
	 - Minerals rearrange themselves, almost cannot recognize the original rocks from before the transformation happened
	 - Schists are the most frequent of metamorphic rocks, formed through regional and burial metamorphism
		 - Dominant rocks of regional metamorphism
	 - Medium Grade Metamorphic Rocks
 - **Gneissic Foliation**:
	 - Layered and wavy strips of pseudo-folds of minerals, effect of very high pressures
	 - High Grade Metamorphic Rocks
