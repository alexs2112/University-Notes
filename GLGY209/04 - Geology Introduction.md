### What is Geology?
 - A branch of science, in the range of natural sciences
 - Study of the Earth, focuses on our planet's composition, processes that happen in its interior or on the surface, and its changes and evolution over time

### Subdisciplines of Geology:
**Crystallography**
 - Science of the principles of mineral architecture
**Minerology**
 - Crystallography plus matter
 - Studies the minerals, chemical composition, occurrence, and how they are associated
**Petrology**
 - Study of rocks
 - Igneous: Earth interior through the solidification of molten matter
 - Sedimentary: Surface of the earth, formed by small particles brought together in a sedimentary base or precipitation
 - Metamorphic: Buried and transformed within the earths crust, resulting in metamorphic rocks. Formed through the transformation of other rocks that remain in solid state (not molten or dissolved)
**Paleontology**
 - Study of the vestiges of ancient life forms
**Statigraphy**
 - Studies the successions of layers and bodies of rocks within the earth interior
 - Extremely vast, not only the arrangement of layers, study the geological type in its relative form
**Structural Geography**
 - Studies the rocks response to applied force. What happens when forces stretch or push in a certain geological area?
**Sedimentology**
 - Study of the sediments
 - Consists of loose particles, not cemented together (vs a rigid rock of cemented particles).
 - Sediments move easily on the surface of the earth.
**Geochronology**
 - Studies the earth's history in absolute form (not relative)
 - Numeric ages in thousands and billions of years, based on radioactive decay
**Tectonics**
 - Studies the surface of our planet over millions of years
 - Unique vs the planets of our solar system, constantly moving and shifting
**Geophysics**
 - Studies the interior of the earth in response to certain interactions
 - Studies earthquakes and seismic waves
