### Definition
 - Any naturally formed chemical substance having a definite chemical composition (not necessarily fixed) and a characteristic crystal structure
 - **Important**: A mineral cannot be broken into different mineral substances

### Mineraloids:
 - Amorphous, naturally occurring substances
 - Example: Opal, amorphous substance formed through the precipitation of silica

### Mineral Imperfections and their Significance
 - Often present imperfections in form, colour, and properties
 - The imperfections show us that they have an internal structure
 - A bunch of example images in the slides

### The Crystalline Network
 - Able to begin developing models of the crystal structure
	 - Can be cubicle, with right angles
 - Crystals: Fundamental units of matter organization, which have regular, repeating architecture (unit cell) reflecting the packing of atoms
 - Exponential increase to magnification in microscopes in 1990s
 - Galena minerals are cubical, has metallic luster reflecting light almost completely
 - Extremely high magnification of a galena mineral surface reveal a regular, repeatable pattern consisting of an alternance of bright and dark spots (checkerboard, with lead and sulphur)
 - Examples of ideal geometrical packing of ions and atoms:
	 - Tetrahedron
	 - Cubical
	 - Octaedron
 - **Geometrical bodies never have round surfaces**

### Is the crystalline network important?
 - Example: Diamond vs Graphite, both are composed of carbon atoms
	 - Diamond: All covalent bonds, very very strong, very homogenous due to the bonds (homogenous mineral)
		 - Form in the deeper parts of the crust and mantle, need huge pressure. Made it to the surface through massive volcanic events (does not happen anymore, only in the oldest portions of the earths crust)
	 - Graphite: Kind of lumpy and very weak, parallel planes of atoms of carbon. The planes are covalently bonded to form hexagons in a honeycomb pattern. The bonds between the planes are vanderwaal bonds (weaker than ionic)
		 - Formed in a variety of conditions
		 - Decomposition of organic matter leaves behind carbon and hydrogen, at very high temperature the hydrogen is expelled, leaving only carbon (graphite)
