### Fossils, Fossilization
 - Fossils are older than 11k years, subfossils are younger than that
**Kinds of Fossils**:
 - Body Fossils: Direct remains of ancient organisms (paleontology)
 - Trace Fossils: Evidence of the activity of ancient organisms (sedimentary petrology)
 - Chemical Fossils (Biomarkers): Organic compounds produced by various organisms, found in strata (geochemistry)
**Fossil Preservation**:
 - Recrystallization: Conversion into different mineral (most common is aragonite to calcite, carbonates)
 - Moldic Preservation: Original shell is dissolved by subterranean fluids leaving a cast, mold is inner rock
	 - Replacement: mold filled with new material, pyritization is the most frequent case
 - Permineralization: Hard body parts with pores (trunks, bones) filled with something (common opal, chalcedony)
 - Carbonization: Often in plants, algae, fish. Deep in Earth crust, all organic material expelled but carbon
 - Congealment: High altitudes, moisture at surface of permafrost form frozen swamps to trap animals
 - Fossilization in Amber, Tar Pits

### Structural Geology
 - Force and stress causing displacement, rotation, strain on rocks
**Kinds of Stress**:
 - Confining: all forces push inwards, no movement, very stable
 - Differential: Compression (push), Tension (stretch), Shear (two directions)
**Crustal Structures**:
 - Folds (ductile deformation), Faults (brittle deformation, breaks crustal cohesion)
 - Forces move inwards, wrinkling the crust
**Kinds of Folds**:
 - Anticlines: Two branches converge upwards, form pointed shape
 - Synclines: Two branches converge downwards, valley shape
 - Monoclines: Weaker crustal forces, can't form two branches, only one slightly tilted branch
**Crustal Structures: Faults**:
 - Fracture in crustal layer is followed by movement (no movement = joint, else fault)
 - Three categories of fault: Strike-Slip (horizontal), Dip-Slip (vertical), Oblique-Slip (both, most common)
 - Three categorizations (diagram in 19): Reverse faults by collision, thrust faults are practically reverse faults but at a small angle (hanging wall moves very far compared to foot wall)

### Stratigraphy, Geological Time
**Steno's Principles**:
 - Book in 1665 revolutionized science, eventually converted to catholicism and turned into saint
 - 1740, creationism mostly vanished in science due to studying layers of Earth and Earth's age
1. Layer Superposition: Oldest layer at bottom, youngest layer at top
2. Layer Successive Formation: Creature to Fossil takes a long time due to no traces of soft body
3. Original Layer Horizontality: Originally layers are horizontal, fold in outcrops due to crustal movements
4. Lateral Layer Continuity: (not a principle), layers of rivers, formed over the entire surface of the basin
**Layer & Facies Terminations**:
 - 5 cases to demonstrate how layers are ordered in the crust (diagram in 20)
**Georges Louis Leclerc - Compte de Buffon**:
 - 1774 - first calculation of the Earth's age based on experimental data, result was wrong (70k years), ended the influence of creationist ideas in science
**Interpreting Stratigraphical Succession**
 - Mudcracks/Dessication cracks form with strong evaporation, wide openings, narrow downwards
 - Ripple marks narrow upwards
 - Burrowings: trace fossils opening upwards
 - Compare normal and inversed stratigraphical successions by their direction (diagram in 21)
**Strata Relationships**:
 - Conformable Succession: No depositional breaks of sedimentation
 - Non-conformable: Strata separated by surfaces of discontinuity encompassing substantial amount of geological time (unconformities), irregular in shape, three types:
 - Disconformity: Surface of erosion/nondeposition between younger and older beds that are parallel
	 - Lower succession formed first, whole block uplifted, eroded, sunk again, then more sedimentation
 - Angular Unconformity: Erosional surface on tilted/folded strata, younger strata deposited on top
 - Nonconformity: Erosion surface that cuts into metamorphic or igneous rocks is covered by sediments
**Relative Ages by Superposition**:
 - Sir William Smith, 1800s: Determine relative ages of rocks in individual successions (can't compare different successions), also demonstrated existence of extinction.
**Correlation by Means of Fossil Ranges**:
 - Fossil ranges define ages of fossils, paired age of layers by their fossils, layers with the same index fossils can be correlated from one section to another (across oceans)
**Igneous Rock Stratigraphy**:
 - Principle of Inclusions: Layers of igneous with inclusions of older layers
	 - Caused by lavaflow picking up detached inclusions of older rocks, then crystallizing
 - Principle of Cross-Cutting Relationships: Long inclusion of younger that cuts through igneous segment
	 - Form nearly parallel lines (dikes), young generations of dikes can keep cutting through older dikes
 - Relative Age of Lavaflows (Sills): Lava flow cooks the younger layers below (sometimes above by injection, cooks both sides). Sedimentary layers above can have inclusions

### Geologic Time Scale
![[Geological_Time_Scale.png]]
**Four Eons**: (Four Eons, Oldest to Youngests)
 - Hadean: No rock record, can't be subdivided
 - Archean: Oldest rocks, highly subjective boundary depending on the oldest rocks we know at the time
 - Proterozoic: Early life forms, oldest fossils, longest in Earth's history. Started when continents moving around the Asthenosphere (instead of just up and down)
 - Phanerozoic: Visible life forms, begins with large size fossils (no microscope)
	 - Defined by agronomic revolution, formation of burrowers, leading to massive diversivfication of life forms on Earth. Evolution takes over, shortly after is the first global predator (360* vision)
**Phanerozoic Subdivisions**: (Three Eras, Oldest to Youngest
 - Paleozoic: Fossils look like aliens, subdivided into seven more periods:
	 - Cambrian: Whales
	 - Ordovician: Ancient Welsh tribes
	 - Silurian: Ancient Welsh tribes
	 - Devonian: England, development of layers of rocks
	 - Mississippian: Mississippi
	 - Pennsylvanian: Pennsylvania, these only recognized in NA (otherwise these two are Carboniferous)
	 - Permian: Russian city in the Euro mountains
 - Mesozoic: Flora and Fauna begin to resemble modern life forms, evolution of mammals who practically took over, reptiles dominate wetter areas. Life diversification.
	 - One big ocean current, Ocean Conveyor, push continents together to form Pangaea
	 - Subdivided into three time periods:
		 - Triassic
		 - Jurassic
		 - Cretaceous
 - Cenozoic:
	 - Ocean Conveyor collapsed, ocean transformed into large swamp, temperature increased, 95% of species died (great dying)
	 - One million years later, Ocean Conveyor restarted and life recovered
	 - Extinction of the dinosaurs, eventual evolution of primates to take over
	 - Subdivided into three time periods:
		 - Paleogene
		 - Neogene
		 - Quaternary

### Radioactive Decay:
 - Unstable nucleus can transform into isotope with stable nucleus, process as radioactive decay
 - Most elements transform over everal steps, radioactive decay series (diagram in 22)
 - Knowing the series of transformation, measure weight of parent and daughter isotopes, calculate age
**Half-Life**:
 - Time for half of the atoms in the unstable parent element to decay to new daughter element
 - Uranium 238 -> Lead 206 is the most relevant isotope pair, half life of 4.5b years
**Geological Time Scale**: Use half-life, radioactive decay to calculate the age of the Earth

### Emergence of Life - Early Atmosphere
 - The dominant elements in the life forms today are CHON (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen)
 - Alexandr Ivanovic Oparin claims no free oxygen in the atmosphere at the beginning of life, a reducing atmosphere. CHON accumulates and dissolves in water, to facilitate the reaction of substances
	 - Primordial Soup, consisting of monomers (organic simple substances)
**Isua Supercrustal Group**:
 - Greenland, some of the oldest sedimentary rocks on Earth (3.8-3.7b years)
 - Graphite levels indicate organic origin, only slightly changed (recognize original rock)
 - Dark blue -> Organic matter desseminated in the mass
	 - Calcite crystals (calcium, oxygen, carbon 3), with thin films of graphite (final product of organic matter decay), traces of original primordial soup
**Experimental Confirmation**:
 - Miller, Urey experiment (1953) obtained 7 aminoacides as organic compounds
 - Added inorganic monomers to a pot, added atmosphere, exposed to heat, UV radiation, electrical discharge (primordial soup) and observed the gasses dissolving to form organic monomers
**Polymerization**:
 - Combining CHON molecules into larger molecules to form polymers, do not fossilize
 - Diagram on 23

### Stromatolites
 - Cryptozoon (hidden organisms, stromatolites), circular fossils, unable to prove what caused them
 - Schreiber Beach (50s), within cryptozoon structures could see organic columns, fossilized precariates (magnification of several thousand times)
	 - Precariate fossils were then being noticed everywhere (extremely diverse)
 - Stromatolites prefer warmer waters, columns situated between tidal zones (harsh conditions)
 - Only live in the uppermost portion of the column, underneath is dead rock (live for a long time)
 - Four distinct zones, from the surface to the center:
	 - Growth surface: thin layer, highest diversity of organisms, (cyano)bacteria, don't need oxygen but produce it. Some are photosynthetic
	 - Undermat: Thin bacterial layer, non-ogygen producing photosynthetic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria, amount of bacteria drops off sharply from growth surface
	 - Oxygen-Depleted Zone: Thicker layer, rare anaerobic bacteria
	 - Stromatolite Mass: Most of the stromatolite, consists of calcium carbonate, no living bacteria
 - Neoarchean period -> global domination, previously only slowly accumulated. Sharply dropped off at the start of the Phanerozoic due to evolved predators

### Banded Iron Formation - BIF
 - Sedimentary rock in Isua formation, alternate thin iron oxides and layers consisting of cherts, jaspers
	 - Layers of reddish rust between layers of greys and greens
 - Combined with oxygen in atmosphere, oxygen in water. Atmosphere transformed from reducing to oxygen filled at this period (first mass extinction, killing all anaerobic organisms)

### Eukaryotes
 - Oldest Eukaryotes are biomarkers that evolved from Prokaryotes (evolved close to 2.1b years ago)
 - First organisms capable of sexual reproduction (not mitotic)
**Bitter Springs Formation**:
 - Australia, first isolated true eukaryotes discovered here
 - Some caught during cellular division, suggests meiotic cell divisions, not found among prokaryotes
**Examples**:
 - Bangiomorpha: First multicellular organisms, red algae, sticks to the seafloor, rise towards sunlight
	 - Proterozoic - quaternary
 - Torridonophycus: Green algae, bag structure to protect against stress and dry climate
	 - Upper proterozoic - quaternary
 - Melanocyrillium: Wide bottom with open top, cytoplast emerges to catch food, animal-like metabolism
	 - Upper proterozoic - quaternary

### Plate Tectonics
 - Deep Sea Drilling Project dug hundreds of wells to map the sea floor. Most of it occupied by flat abyssal plane, with a huge underwater mountain range in the center
**Planetary Magnetic Fields**:
 - Started by ignition of the sun, allows migration paths, minerals will align themselves with magnetic field. They flip flop by 180 degrees depending on depth in the Earth
	 - Also happens at the bottom of the sea depending on distance from mid-oceanic rift
**Ocean Formation Model**:
 - Forms in continental (not oceanic) zones, thick continental crust
 - Currents of heat move upwards, over time makes the crust very thin and forms a depression zone
 - As the push continues, forms oceanic basin, creates a mountain range at the center that pushes against the broken continent and expands the ocean
 - Examples: East African Rift (oxygenated water over layer of toxic water due to volcanism) and Benioff Plane (border of Pacific Plate and North American Plate, many earthquakes)
**Oceanic Crust Consumption**:
 - Subduction (therefore consumption) can occur between plates of oceanic crust, or plates of different constitution (continental vs oceanic)
 - Subduction accompanied with volcanism, crustal movements -> sediment folding, faulting, earthquake
**Wilson Cycle**:
 - Represents cycle of birth, evolution/expansion, closure of oceanic basin (Diagram at 26)
