 - An ion with a positive charge is referred to as a cation
 - Diamond is the hardest mineral on the Mohs hardness scale
 - Transparency is the physical property that describes how light passes through a mineral
 - Sulphur is a native element that is not a semimetal (arsenic, bismuth, antimony all are semimetals)
 - Dolomite is a mixed carbonate of calcium and magnesium
 - Double-chain silicates are also known as Sorosilicates
 - Tectosilicates are the most frequent silicates in the Earth's crust
 - An electrically charged atom is known as an Ion
 - Basalt is an example of rock with aphanitic texture
 - An amorphous igneous rock has glassy texture
 - An igenous rock in which minerals dominate over the amorphous substance (matrix) is also known as Hypohyaline and hypocrystalline
 - Phenocrysts occur in the porphyritic igneous rock texture
 - Sill is not a discordant body of igneous rocks (batholith, stock, dike all are)
 - Gases are trapped in extrusive rocks with vesicular texture
 - Lava plateaus are the largest bodies of extrusive rocks
 - Gypsum and Anhydrite are sulphates
 - The bonds between the silica tetrahedra and cations in silicates are Ionic
 - Groups of organisms that often precipitate minerals such as sulphur are Bacteria
 - The crystal structure of the mineral Galena is cubical
 - According to their shape, the quartz minerals in the thin section above are Anhedral
 - The silicate group that presents the crystal structure with silica tetrahedra bonded in a tri-dimensional network are the Tectosilicates
 - Poikilitic rock textures document two phases of crystallization, the molten matter of the later phase presents significant chemical homogeneity
 - Volcanic ejecta with molten matter in their composition are referred to as Lava flows
 - The source of the solid particles in suspension in the Earth atmosphere are volcanic activity and the wind erosion of pre-existent rocks
 - Physical Weathering is the type of weathering that is not characterized by the formation of new minerals with different composition
 - The number of protons in the atomic nucleus is known as the Atomic Number
 - Fragmental rocks are considered at the boundary between igneous and sedimentary domains
 - Larger minerals which are included in the microcrystalline mass of a phaneritic rock are referred to as Phenocrysts
 - Vesicular basalts are indicative for High-Viscosity lava flows
 - Volcanic Eruptions are the way material from the Earth's interior is brought up to the surface
 - Lithification is the process that ends the clastic rock formation cycle
 - The atom is the smallest unit of an element
 - Artificial diamonds are not considered minerals in geology because they are artificially manufactured
 - Crystallization is the final effect of magma cooling
 - Burial metamorphism happens in zone C, the burial zone that sits on the continental crust
 - Schists are formed in zone A of the continental crust
 - Granite is not a metamorphic rock (schists, marbles, and gneiss all are)
 - Marble is an example of a rock formed through thermal metamorphism
 - Migmatite is a metamorphic rock that presents partial melting
 - Most fossils in metamorphic rocks occur in Slates
