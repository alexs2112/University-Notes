 - Pseudoscience: Intelligent design and Creation science (not art or religion)
 - The word "Theory" is associated in science as an accepted explanation for a set processes or phenomena
 - Science does not study only the processes that can be observed directly as they happen
 - A hypothesis is at first formulated through the interpretation of the experimental and/or observation data
 - Petrology is the branch of geology that represents the study of rocks
 - Structural geology represents the study of the rock response to applied force
 - Most of the mass of a star consists of Hydrogen and Helium
 - The Big Bang Theory explains the beginning of the known universe expansion
 - Flying mountains is another name used for the asteroids
 - The surface of Mars presents evident traces of water erosion
 - Characteristics of the Jovian Planets: Much larger than terrestrial, many moons, smaller density than terrestrial, contain rings
 - Hydrogen is the dominant element in Jovian planets
 - The natural satellite of Jupiter named Io has active volcanism
 - Most of the meteorites are Chondrites
 - Meteorites with small amounts of organic matter in their composition are known as Carbonatious Chondrites (none of the above)
 - Neither Mars, Earth, Venus, Saturn formed first according to the Solar Nebula Theory (none of the above)
 - Solar energy is dissipated in the Solar System mostly through Solar Wind
 - Mercury was left without most of its atmospheric gases when the Sun ignited
 - The cold contracting cloud from the earliest stage of the Solar System formation can be best described as a Nebula
 - Most of the Earth's volume is occupied by the Mantle, according to chemical composition
 - Earthquakes are extensively used to study the Earth interior
 - The asthenosphere is characteristic to Earth compared to the other planets of the Solar System
 - The outer core of the Earth's interior is in liquid physical state
 - The physical state of the asthenosphere can be best described as plastic
 - The crust is the Earth's outermost layer according to chemical and mineralogical composition
 - Aluminium is the dominant metal in the Earth's crust
 - The Rocky Mountains were formed as the result of collision between the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate
 - Philosophy is, like science, completely relative
 - Physical Geology is a major stream that studies the recent changes on Earth, usually younger than 10000 years
 - The parameters of Temperature and Pressure determine the inner core physical state of "Liquid but behaves as a solid"
