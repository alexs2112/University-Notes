### Major Groups
 - Two main groups of igneous rocks according to magma depth of cooling
 - **Intrusive**: Magma cools and crystallizes within the Earth's crust
	 - Formed slowly within the Earth's interior, crystals have the time to grow and are obvious to the eye (pink granite has many flecks of colours)
 - **Extrusive**: Magma cools and crystallizes at the surface of the Earth
	 - Process of cooling is very fast, the magma will crystallize in a matter of days, crystals don't have time to grow and remain small
 - Magma vs Lava has been determined to not have a difference, Lava will not be used on the midterm
 - As magma moves towards the surface, it loses heat, certain elements in the magma begins to crystallize
	 - Complex mixture of substances
	 - Three components: molten matter, crystals, liquids/gases
	 - Liquids were discovered due to the existence of diamonds, diamonds need water

### Igneous Classification
 - Four main types can be recognized according to crystal size
 - **Phaneritic**
 - **Aphanitic**
 - **Glassy**
 - **Fragmental**

### Phaneritic
 - Relatively large crystals in their mass
 - Characterized by the fact that the crystals can be seen with the unaided eye or magnifier (such as hand lens)
 - Indicative of slow cooling
 - Examples: Granite, Granodiorite

### Aphanitic
 - Characterized by the presence of small-sized crystals, cannot be seen with the unaided eye
 - Can be seen if you make a cross section through the rock and study with a microscope
 - Indicative of rapid cooling
 - Examples: Banded rhyolite, Basalt

### Glassy
 - Indicates the molten material crystallized very rapidly, no time for elements to arrange themselves into solid crystalline compounds
 - Crystallization process lasts a few seconds
 - Result is amorphous non-crystalline glass (extrusive)
 - Examples: Obsidian, Snowflake obsidian

### Fragmental
 - Consist of pyroclastic material ejected as laval from a volcano, falls down at the Earth's surface as partly consolidated rocks
 - Mixed characteristics, igneous and sedimentary
 - Examples: Tuff

### Phaneritic Rock Textures
 - Textures are important as they can offer clues of significant importance for reconstructing the crystallization sequence
 - Simply looking at the size of minerals, one can infer the process (heat, chemistry of the magma chamber)
 - **Granular**
	 - Formed by a lot of minerals of almost the same dimensions
 - **Porphyritic**
	 - Big mineral chunks that are well-developed, set in a mass of very very small minerals (so small they don't let the light pass through them)
	 - Process of slow cooling was somehow altered partway through after the bigger minerals were formed, heat was very rapidly lost, forming the "ground mass"/"matrix" of small minerals
 - **Poikilitic**
	 - Larger minerals that sit in what looks like a ground mass, however it is not a ground mass.
		 - Light will not pass through, rotate it 90* and it will pass through depending
	 - Two phases of crystallization, high melting point minerals (olivine in the examples) first start to form within the magma chamber, then the remaining molten matter became very homogeneous and became one single mineral.
		 - Not separated in terms of speed, but in mineralogical results

### Bodies of intrusive rocks
Batholith largest body of intrusive rocks
 - Magma chamber which solidified in the Earth's interior, then raised to the surface
Stock, very large body of intrusive rocks
 - Column shape, prismatic

### Igneous Bodies of Rocks
 - **Dike**: An obvious cut of a different rock through another body of rocks
 - **Sill**: Parallel/horizontal layer of rocks between two layers of rocks. Layers originally adjacent, sill was injected between them. 

*Colours of the below images come from filtering the light passed through the microscope, displays many different colours from the minerals*
