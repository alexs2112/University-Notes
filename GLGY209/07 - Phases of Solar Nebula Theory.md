### Phase 1: Contracting Cold Cloud
 - Starts from a huge cloud of gases and cosmic dust
 - Dominated by hydrogen and helium
	 - Carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and other elements are present as traces
 - Cold cloud started to contract and rotate slowly

### Phase 2: Rotating & Heating Cloud
 - Rotation became dominant over translation
 - Cloud assumed a lens shape
 - Cloud became discoidal
 - Rotation speed increased
 - Matter started to concentrate and heat in the central part of the cloud
	 - Incipient heating

### Phase 3: Chaotic Swirling & Incipient Accretion
 - Small-sized particles of the cloud started to aggregate to form larger particles of rock, up to several meters in dimension.
	 - In the earlier stages, the newly formed rocks were irregular in shape
	 - Started to create a gravitational field, attracting new particles
 - The newly occurred sources of heterogeineity in the mass of the cloud represented a source for turbulent movements
 - As a result, the mass of the cloud started to be concentrated not only in its central part, but also in a number of concentrical rings around it

### Phase 4: Formation of the Protoplanets
 - The chunks began to increase in size, assuming a quasi-spherical shape
 - The protoplanets were larger, but with a reduced specific gravity than present-day planets
 - Matter of each protoplanet started to collapse due to gravitational attraction
 - Very hot, lots of energy from being constantly in collision with other objects in space
 - Matter condensation within the protoplanets initiated the process of gravitational differentiation
	 - Globes of incandescent metal, at some point the melting point of iron was reached.
	 - Heavier metals drawn to the center of the planets due to gravity
	 - Lighter metals migrated to the surface
 - Protosun: The heating process conducted to the existence of a temperature of several million degrees in the center of the protosun
 - The cause was only the gravitationally controlled matter compression

### Phase 5: Birth of the Sun
 - Initiation of the thermonuclear reactions resulted in the ignition of the central star of our solar system
 - As the Sun ignited, gases from its near proximity were ionized rapidly
 - Radiation flux from the Sun also initiated at this time, known as *Solar Wind*
	 - Gave planets a magnetic field. Solar Wind sent electrical charges to the quickly rotating metallic planets
 - The planets from the close proximity of the Sun, having smaller masses and incipiently developing gravitational and magnetic fields, could not retain lighter elements as part of their atmosphere
	 - Sun stealing their atmosphere, Mercury does not have an atmosphere anymore
 - The Jovian planets were successfully able to retain these lighter elements
 - Jovian vs Terrestrial planets: Main difference is the nature of the gases retained in their atmosphere

### Phase 6: Major Collisions and Readjustments
 - In earlier stages, a larger number of planets were expected to be formed
 - As planets formed, the differentiation process initiated
 - Collisions between these newly formed protoplanets (not on stable orbits) resulted in a larger number of meteorites
