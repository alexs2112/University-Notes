### Georges Louis Leclerc - Compte de Buffon
 - 1774 - First calculation of the Earth's age based on experimental data
 - Result was wrong, age of ~70000 years was considered too young by scientists
 - Ended the influence of creationist ideas in science

### Interpreting Stratigraphical Succession
 - Sedimentological data can be used to decipher the order of depositions of various sedimantary strata
 - Particular structures such as desiccation cracks (mudcracks) and ripple marks are of great value in recognizing the original position of the sea bottom
	 - Mudcracks form at the surface of the Earth with strong evaporation
		 - Present maximum width towards the upper part of the layer (the opening)
	 - Ripple marks narrow upwards
 - Burrowings: Trace fossils from digging organisms looking for food/shelter, opening upwards (can't be dug from the bottom up)
	 - Can use these layers to compare normal stratigraphical successions and inversed stratigraphical succession

### Strata Relationships
 - Conformable Succession: Strata without depositional breaks of sedimentation
 - Non-Conformable Succession: Strata are separated by surfaces of discontinuity encompassing substantial amounts of geological time (unconformities)
	 - Irregular in shape
	 - Three types of non-conformable successions
 - Conclusions were drawn from these successions, they were wrong

### Disconformity
 - A surface of erosion or nondeposition between younger and older beds that are parallel with each other
 - Layers from the lower succession were formed first, then the whole block was uplifted, eroded, then sunk again. Sedimentation restarted, forming more regular layers

### Angular Unconformity
 - Erosional surface on tilted or folded strata, over which younger strata has been deposited
 - Angle is different

### Nonconformity
 - Type of unconformity in which an erosion surface that cuts into metamorphic or igneous rocks is covered by sedimentary rocks

### Relative Ages by Superposition
 - Sir William Smith, writings in 1800s
 - We can determine the relative ages of the rocks in individual successions
 - But you can't compare the ages between different successions
 - (Also demonstrated the existence of the process of extinction)

### Correlation by Means of Fossil Ranges
 - Fossil ranges define ages of fossils by the creatures that form them
 - Paired the age of layers with the fossils found in them, some fossils have very narrow stratigraphical ranges
 - Layers containing the same index fossils can be correlated from one section to another, across oceans
