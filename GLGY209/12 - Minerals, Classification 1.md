### Native Elements (Pure Elements)
 - Consists of free, uncombined elements, subdivided into three categories
 - **Metals** (Au, Cu, Pt, Bi, Ag, etc):
	 - Dense, soft, opaque, malleable, ductile. 
	 - Common habits: Massive, dendritic, wire-like
 - **Semimetals** (Sb, As):
	 - Poor electricity conductors
	 - Commonly occur in nodular masses
 - **Nonmetals** (S, C):
	 - Transparent to translucent
	 - Do not conduct electricity
	 - Trend to form distinct, often large-sized crystals

### Sulfides and Sulfosalts
 - **Sulfides** are minerals formed by a metallic element and Sulfur.
	 - Sulfur can be replaced by tellurium (tellurides) or arsenic (arsenides)
	 - Often present in metallic lusters (galena), and can be dense (galena, molybdenite, etc)
	 - Some are nonmetallic (opiment, realgar)
	 - Most frequent sulfide in nature is Pyrite (FeS2)
	 - Some sulfides are toxic (Realgar AsS, Orpiment As2S3) or radioactive
 - **Sulfosalts** are mixed sulfides in which a semimetallic element is present together with a metallic one

### Oxides and Hydroxides
 - **Oxides** are compounds formed from various metallic elements and oxygen, in which the oxygen plays the role of an anion
	 - Oxides occur in a variety of environments, often encountered in all three rock families  (igneous, metamorphic, sedimentary)
	 - Properties are extremely varied, habit and color are extremely variable
	 - Examples (*don't need to know*): 
		 - Magnetite (Fe3O4): Commonly occurs in small octahedral and dodecahedral crystals. Black, opaque, metallic lustre. Hardness: 5.5 - 6.5
		 - Ilmenite (FeTiO3): Mostly present as isolated crystals. Lamellar habit is frequent, along with twinning. Hardness: 5-6
		 - Rutile (TiO2): Reddish brown to black, transparent to opaque, frequent with metallic luster. Hardness: 6-6.5
		 - Uraninite (UO2): Often occurs as botryoidal masses, color is brown to black, metallic to dull luster. Radioactive. Hardness: 5-6
		 - Corundum (Al2O3): Bipyramidal to Rhombohedral crystals, also occurs in massive and granular habits. Translucent with vitreous luster, Hardness: 9
		 - Saphire (Al2O3): Blue variety of Corundum
		 - Ruby (Al2O3): Red variety of Corundum, translucent to transparent

### Carbonates, Nitrates, Borates
 - Minerals that contain the radicals CO3 (carbonate), NO2 (nitrate), and BO3 (borate)
 - **Carbonates**
	 - Most common is Calcite (CaCO3)
	 - Carbonate minerals are usually present as well-developed rhombohedral crystals
	 - Commonly present bright colours

### Sulfates, Chromates, Molybdates, Tungstates
 - Minerals in which the metallic elements are combined with the radicals SO4 (sulfate), CrO4 (chromate),  MoO4 (molybdate), and WO4 (tungstate)
 - Sulfate is the only relevant one for the course
 - **Sulfates**
	 - The most common is gypsum (CaSO4)
	 - Most of the occurrences are in evaporite rocks
	 - Commonly they are soft, light minerals, present in pale colours
