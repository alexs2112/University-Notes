### Deep Sea Drilling Project
 - Investigated the sediments & sedimentary rocks in the deepest parts of the Planetary Ocean
 - Hundreds of wells have been drilled
 - Observations have been made on the sea floor morphology
 - Mapping the sea floor, a priority for wartime submarines
 - Most of the sea floor occupied by a flate plane (abyssal plane), big underwater mountain range

### Planetary Magnetic Fields
 - Started by ignition of the sun
 - Very important for certain organisms (migration paths)
 - Minerals are not neutral, positive and negative poles
	 - Minerals settling at the bottom of a basin will align themselves with the magnetic field
	 - At a certain depth in the Earth, minerals would reverse their alignment by 180 degrees. Eventually, minerals would realign themselves, and flip themselves again
	 - Magnetic poles were reversing depending on depth
 - This also happens at the bottom of the sea, reversed by distance from the mid-oceanic ridge

### Ocean Formation Model
 - An ocean forms in continental (not oceanic) zones, thick continental crust
 - Something happens in the asthenosphere below, currents of heat move upwards, pushing on the continental crust. In time, will make that crust very thin
	 - Forms a depression zone, accumulates water
	 - Huge number of earthquakes, eventually volcanic events
	 - As the push from the asthenosphere currents continue, it will form an oceanic basin
	 - Creates a mountain range at the center, the two slabs will push against the broken continent, expanding the ocean.
 - East African Rift as an example of this
	 - Forms large lakes, consistent with the model, the composition of the water in these lakes are totally different than most, the water is stratified
	 - Oxygenated layer of water at the top, underneath the layer is a layer of toxic water, enriched in methane, ammonia, carbon dioxide. Organisms do not live there. Due to volcanic activity
