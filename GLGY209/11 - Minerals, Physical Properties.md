### Mineral Physical Properties
 - Can be used to recognize a mineral, although they cannot be sufficient

**Colour**
 - A huge variability in colour, the most deceiving physical property
 - Some of the minerals have a well-defined colour when pure
 - Impurities can significantly affect mineral colour

**Lustre**
 - Represents the qualitative expression of light reflection from a mineral
	 - Can be used in the description of the single minerals, or aggregates of minerals
 - Most common descriptive terms for luster: Metallic, Vitreous, Dull, Silky, Greasy

**Crystal Faces and Crystal Form**
 - Best examples to illustrate the crystal form are from thin sections
	 - Euhedral: Planar faces, corners are well-developed and angular
	 - Subhedral: Consistency in general aspect, faces are not planar, corners are rounded
	 - Anhedral: Irregular, not well-defined form

**Twinning**
 - A growth phenomenon
 - Some minerals can put together portions of their crystal structure
 - Can be defined as the symmetrical intergrowth of two or more crystals of the same substance
 - Can be seen in both hand specimens and in thin sections
 - Classifications: Simple Twins; Multiple (polysynthetic) Twins
 - Can be a diagnostic feature of some minerals (feldspar, staurolite)

**Transparency**
 - Describes how an object can be seen behind a mineral
 - Transparent: Objects can be seen through them
 - Translucent: Objects cannot be clearly seen
 - Opaque: Light does not pass through, even if cut thin

**Mineral Toughness/Hardness**
 - Property referring to the force necessary to scratch the mineral's surface
 - Strongly depends on the bonds in the crystal structure
 - A relative hardness scale is used by geologists, known as the *Mohs* hardness scale that goes from 1 (Talc) to 10 (Diamond)
