**Final Lecture for Midterm Material**

### Earth's Physical Properties & Chemical Composition
 - Layered structure
	 - Can be inferrered from the early history of our planet, supported by the data from the nearby celestial bodies
 - Two sets of characteristics to recognize the quasi-concentric components

### Gravitational Differentiation Process
 - Proto-Earth gradually increased in size due to accretion of particles from surrounding space
 - Collosion with asteroids, proto-planets, and other debris caused a steady increase in temperature
	 - Another cause was most likely the decay of radioactive elements
 - **Proto Earth's temperature reached the melting point of iron and nickel**

### Investigating the Earth's Interior
 - Seismic wave behaviour can be used to investigate the internal structure of the Earth
	 - Our drilling tools can't handle the stress of the increased temperature in the earth. The deepest has been 9.8 km (Earth's radius is > 6k km)
	 - Devised a new method, Seismic investigation
	 - Detonate an explosive charge at the surface of the Earth/bottom of the sea after spreading a number of geophones
	 - Geophones will record the waves produced by the detonation (Seismic Observatories now, in every country to record every large energy discharge around the world)
	 - If you use large explosive charges, you can record up to 60 km deep in the earth, still not very far
	 - Wait for natural energy discharges, vast and far more powerful, producing waves throughout the entire Earth (earthquakes)
 - Two subdivisions of the Earth's interior, made according to **Chemical Composition** and **Physical Properties**
 - Earthquakes happen when two layers within the Earth move among each other, they get stuck and build up energy, when they start moving again the energy is discharged

### Subdivisions of the Earth's Interior
 - An iron core, consisting of a solid inner core and a liquid outer core
	 - Inner core is liquid but behaves as a solid
		 - Liquid because of the temperature, behaves as a solid because of the very high pressure
 - Then the mantle, made of silicates. Called the Mesosphere and is solid
	 - Gutenberg Continuity between the Mantle and the Core
 - Then the Earth's crust, also made of silicates. Broken into the Asthenosphere (plastic material, between the Lithosphere and the Mesosphere) and the Lithosphere (rigid, outer part of the earth)
	 - Contains the most minerals due to having the most contact within the outer spheres
	 - Moho Continuity, the transition layer between the Crust and Mantle
     - Continents and oceans are on the Lithosphere, which floats on top of the plastic Asthenosphere, explains why continents move around
     - Once the Asthenosphere was created and the continents started to move around, it forces the primitive life forms on the surface to evolve due to the challenges of the shifting Earth
     - Crust presents variable thickness, has two types:
	     - Continental Crust: 20-75km thick, granite rocks, rich in Si, Al, Na, and K
	     - Oceanic Crust: 8-10km thick, basaltic rocks, denser than continentall crust, rich in Fe + Mg
		     - Denser, almost always below the continental crust

### Elemental Composition of the Earth
 - Distribution of elements in the interior of the Earth is highly variable
 - Estimations are different for the whole Earth, and the Earth's crust
 - Iron is the most frequent element on Earth, however there is not a whole lot of iron at the surface, a ton concentrated in the core
 - Oxygen, followed by Silicon, dominate the Earth after Iron, two main elements of the silicates (4 oxygen, 1 silicon)
	 - These are the only 3 elements we have to know
 - Looking at the crust, Oxygen > Silicon > Aluminum (a lighter metal, then Iron)
