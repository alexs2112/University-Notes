 - Don't memorize numerical data (dates of scholars, just the time period that they lived, late rennaissance, etc)
 - Only important one, Royal Society of London: 1660, aftermath of English civil war, during the Restoration
	 - Birth of modern science
	 - Francis Bacon published his thing here
	 - Thomas Burnett published book about inorganic molecules rather than divine intervention
 - Science is completely relative to reality
	 - Religion, Art, and Law are absolute and do not change
	 - Philosophy is also relative to reality, although in Science the data is coming from direct experiments, Philosophical data comes from a variety of fields (including Religion and Art)
	 - Science does not accept Agnosticism (do not accept "we will never know x thing")
 - Geology and its subdisciplines
	 - Focus on historical and physical geology
	 - Learn the differences between the subdisciplines, don't need specifics
	 - Crystallography: Mineral architecture
	 - Minerology: Crystallography with matter, chemical composition, occurrence, etc
	 - Petrology: Study of rocks, igneous, metamorphic, sedimentary
	 - Paleontology: Study of Ancient life forms
	 - Statigraphy: Layers of the Earth
	 - Structural Geography: Stress testing the surface of the Earth
	 - Sedimentology: Study of the sediments
	 - Geochronology: Study of the age of the Earth in absolute time over millenia
	 - Tectonics: Surface of the Earth over millions of years
	 - Geophysics: Interior of the Earth in response to certain interactions
 - Learn characteristics of the Milky Way
	 - Know the four arms of our galaxy, we are part of `Cygnus-Orion` arm
 - Memorize: Universe expansion initiated `13.7-13.8 billion years ago`
 - Know the charts produced by COBE WMAP
 - Nebulae dominated by hydrogen and helium
 - Know the difference between Terrestrial and Jovian planets
 - Asteroids: Flying Mountains
 - Dominant metals in meteorites is Iron, second is Nickel
 - Know the phases of the Solar Nebula Theory
	 - Probably the most difficult part of the midterm
 - Three particularly important aspects:
	 - Starting in phase 4, gravitational differentiation process
		 - Heavier elements concentrating in core of protoplanets, lighter elements to surface
	 - Birth of the sun in phase 5
	 - Major orbital readjustments and collisions in phase 6
		 - Earth and Thea collided, resulting in the moon
 - Know the Core, Mantle, Crust
	 - Core - Metallic
	 - Mantle, Crust - Dominated by silicates
	 - Crust has higher mineral density
 - Gutenberg between Core and Mantle, Moho between Mantle and Crust
 - Characteristics of Lithosphere, Asthenosphere, Menosphere, Outer Core, Inner Core
 - Characteristics of crust and separation into oceanic and continental, and dominant components
	 - Continental: Thicker (20-75km), Silicon, Aluminum, Sodium, Potassium
	 - Oceanic: Thinner (8-10km), denser, Iron, Magnesium
 - Elemental composition of the earth
	 - Full Earth: Iron, Oxygon, Silicon
	 - Earth Crust: Oxygon, Silicon, Aluminum
 - Plates move with respect to each other, several thousand plates exist today
	 - Pacific Plate and North American Plate form the Rocky Mountains
