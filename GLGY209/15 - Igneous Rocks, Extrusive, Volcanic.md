### Extrusive Rocks
 - Process of cooling is very fast, the magma will crystallize in a matter of days, crystals don't have time to grow and remain small

### Volcanic Igneous Rocks
 - Journey of intrusive igneous rocks ends in the crust where they cool and crystallize
 - Volcanic igneous rocks are further influenced by various volcanic processes, which can affect their form and texture
 - Two main types of extrusive (volcanic) rocks
	 - **Lava Flows** (aphanitic igneous rocks)
		 - Contain incandescent matter
	 - **Pyroclastic Flow** (fragmental igneous rocks)
		 - Without incandescent matter

### Other Textures in Basaltic Lava
 - **Vesicular basalt**, vesicles are preserved gas cavities
	 - Inverted bubbly texture, lots of small holes
	 - Occurs in high viscosity lava flows, as they move (slowly) they embed portions of the atmosphere as gas bubbles
 - **Pillow Basalts**. Basalt lava flows with bulbous appearance that form from underwater eruptions
	 - Large round chunks of rocks
	 - Magma from the core reaches the Earth's surface at the bottom of the ocean, very cold with colossal hydraulic pressure. Lava flow crystallizes almost instantly, creating glassy rocks in pseudo-spherelike structure

### Volcanic Ash and Tuff
 - Particles expelled during volcanic eruptions, components of the pyroclastic flows (no molten matter)
 - The volcanic ash falls and forms a very loose sediment, 1 meter of ash can be condensed into 1 cm
 - The rock that forms from the concentration of the sediment is called Tuff

### Volcanic Bombs and volcanic Breccia
 - Volcanic bombs are large-sized rock fragments, ejected during the volcanic eruptions, have a size of up to several meters
	 - Can be thrown 800-900 meters from the eruption, presents problems for certain communities near active volcanism
