### Ancient Science
 - Science rooted in astronomical observations
 - For navigation over long distances
 - Example: Polynesian colonization on the Pacific Islands
 - Transfer of expertise

### Greek Rationalism
 - Ancient Greeks were the first who tried to provide a rational explanation of the astronomical objects and their movement, without involving supernatural causes
 - Greek philosophers remain famous for the first *models of nature*. They used their models to understand, explain, and predict the natural reality
 - First heliocentric model produced at this time
 - European Dark Ages happened around the time of the collapse of the Roman Empire

### New and Revolutionary Discoveries
 - Copernicus (1543) - Heliocentric System
 - Galileo (1910) - Primitive telescope, made observations on Jupiter's satellites, moon, etc
 - Johannes Kepler - Described the correct path of the planet's rotation around the sun (Kepler's Laws)

### Royal Society of London
 - **Establishment in 1660** `MEMORIZE THIS NUMBER`
 - During the Restoration, after the English Civil War
 - Science was defined as distinct and independent of human inquiry
 - Experimental data got prominence over interpretation, etc

### Birth of science
 - According to the principles established above, science was defined as a method to investigate the various natural phenomena
 - No influence from other human inquiries was accepted (philosophy, religion, scholasticisim, etc)
 - Use of scientific method in investigating the natural reality should provide objective and predictable results.

### Scientific Approach
 - Trial and Error method used for investigating the natural reality
 - Data is obtained through lab experiments, direct observations, and interpretations based on verifiable data
 - Data is checked and peer-reviewed before publication
 - The resulting *hypothesis* is re-checked. If it stands critics, can be transformed into a *theory*.

### Scientific Language
 - Importance of the scientific language can probably be best seen through the use of the word "theory"
 - In common language, "theory" is associated with incertitude
 - In scientific language, "theory" is associated with demonstrated ideas and facts, a theory remains true until proven wrong or insufficient to accomodate additional data
 - Science is relative to reality, while Religion, Art, and Law are absolute and do not change (law, for periods of time)

### Characteristics of Science
 - Scientific approach is thoroughly used. All the data can be tested
	 - Developed through contradiction and debate
 - Potentially unlimited fields of study and research
 - No directionality in science. We don't prove something in particular (biased, pseudoscience), but make research on a particular phenomenon
