### CHON
 - The dominant elements in the life forms today are:
	 - Carbon
	 - Hydrogen
	 - Oxygen
	 - Nitrogen
 - Sulfur and Phosphorus are present in smaller amounts

### Earth's Early Atmosphere
 - Alexandr Ivanovic Oparin (1896-1980) postulated that it is possible that CHON molecules could have been formed before life, to give rise to the first cells
 - A starting point of Oparin's model was the fact that the plant cells are too complex to have been formed without a long process of inorganic evolution
 - Claimed that the atmosphere was totally different at the beginning of life. No free oxygen, a **reducing atmosphere**
	 - CHON molecules could be accumulated in a reducing atmosphere, and then dissolved in water
	 - Water could facilitate the reaction of substances
	 - Resulting substance: primordial soup, consisting of monomers (organic simple substances)

### Isua Supercrustal Group
 - Greenland
 - Some of the oldest sedimentary rocks on Earth (3.8-3.7 billion years)
 - Rare oxides and carbonates that do not form layers
 - Graphite levels indicate organic origin
 - Only slightly affected by metamorphism, you can recognize the original rock
 - Mostly dark blue -> Organic matter desseminated in the mass
	 - Calcite crystals (Calcium, Oxygen, Carbon 3)
	 - Also contains very thin films of graphite, final product of organic matter decay
		 - Organism with minimal structure, thin with no variation of thickness, 3.8 billion years ago
	 - Traces of the original primordial soup, probably some primitive organisms in the soup that were capable of producing oxygen

### Experimental Confirmation
 - Miller and Urey experiment (1953) demonstrated the possibility that simple elements can react chemically to form simple organic CHON molecules
 - They obtained seven aminoacids (glycine, alanine, etc) -> organic compounds
	 - Added inorganic monomers to a pot, added an atmosphere, heated the whole thing and subjected it to ultraviolet radiations and electrical discharges
		 - Simulating primordial soup, extremely dense
	 - Observed the gasses dissolving into the water, combining to form organic monomers, most of them aminoacids
		 - Created organic monomers from inorganic monomers
	 - Revealed the complexity of the substances produced on Earth in those early times. A lot of scientists came up with different organic substances
 - Eventually, a new set of experiments including rocks, not just gases and liquids
	 - Number of results increased exponentially

### Polymerization
 - Combining the simple CHON molecules into larger molecules would result in the formation of polymers, a necessary step in the development of the life forms on Earth
 - Polymers do not fossilize
 - Simple reactions, had to repeat several times as the surface of Earth kept getting sterilized
	 - Eventually it worked out

### Isolated Cells
 - Early Archean of western Australia (Pilbara Craton)
 - Apex Chert is a lithological unit in a volcano-sedimentary formation
	 - Situated between two different lava flows
	 - 3.465 billion years old, need to know this
		 - Oldest life froms on Earth
 - Earliest bacteria and cyanobacteria debris
