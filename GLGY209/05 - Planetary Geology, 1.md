### Overview
 - Look at the earth as part of larger systems
	 - Solar system
	 - Milky Way
	 - Known universe
 - Components of the solar system
 - We have enough info to infer the formation of our planet in an astrophysical perspective

### The Milky Way Galaxy
 - Agglomeration of over 200 million stars
	 - This number is wrong, kept in the slides for historical purposes, newer data says there are more than one billion stars in the MW. (Science is relative)
 - Other components of the MW: Planets gravitating around the stars, nebulae, interstellar dust, etc
	 - Main components are the stars and the nebulae
 - All of them gravitate around the center of the galaxy, which consists of closely-spaced stars and dense dust
 - Stars and the nebulae are concentrated in certain portions
 - MW has a lens shape when seen in edge view, very flat
 - Our sun is situated at approx 22k light years from the center of the galaxy, 20 light years from the galactic equator
 - The galaxy has four arms:
	 - Perseus
	 - **Cygnus-Orion** (where we are, very important)
	 - Sagittarius
	 - Centaurus
 - Not the largest object in our known universe. Part of a group of galaxies (the Local Group of Galaxies, more than 40 galaxies)
	 - Part of the Virgo Supercluster, only a small part in our map of the known universe

### Galaxy red and blue shift
 - American astronomer, Vesto Slipher, who studied the fingerprints in the galaxy light
	 - Observed that distant galaxies moving away from the Earth present a distinct red-shift
	 - Those very few that move towards us present a clear blue-shift
 - Realized that the universe is moving, not static, shifting around and dynamic
 - With the new generation of telescopes, Edwin Hubble observed that the further away a galaxy it is, the faster it is receding
	 - **The universe is expanding!**
	 - A monumental shift at the paradigm level
 - If the universe is expanding, where did the process of expansion begin?

### Known Universe Age
 - Can be inferred by calculating the rate of expansion
 - Calculated that the process of Universe expansion initiated approximately **13.7-13.8 billion years ago** `MEMORIZE`
	 - By the Big Bang Theory
 - The mass of the Universe was concentrated in a very small part of space

### Big-Bang Theory
 - The initiation of the Universe expansion, not an explosion or the start of time, just the beginning of when the Universe began to take shape
 - Experimental confirmation of the Big-Bang came in the last two decades, with the measurements made by two spacecraft: COBE and WMAP
	 - Wanted physical proof of those numbers, these projects confirmed it
	 - COBE: Cosmic Background Explorer (1992)
		 - Measured the discrete temperature fluctuations in the deepest regions of space
	 - WMAP: Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (2001)
		 - Plotted the oldest light in the Universe in the deepest regions of space
			 - Maps out the age of light
	 - The two diagrams produced by both spacecraft present almost the same image
	 - Clear evidence that the Big Bang happened **13.7-1.38 billion years ago**

### Inside the Galaxy: Nebulae
 - Nebulae are concentrations of interstellar gas and dust. Also contain large amounts of isolated fundamental particles floating around
 - Don't have a well defined form
 - Formed through a variety of processes
	 - Concentration of small-sized material
	 - Explosion of one star or another celestial body
	 - Collision between two or (rarely) more celestial bodies
 - Matter density is not equal, portions are more or less dense in different parts of the nebulae

### The Eagle nebula
 - Probably one of the most spectacular we know
 - Consists of dust, gases (hydrogen, helium, etc), and probably vapors. Often referred to as "interstellar fog"
 - Regarded as a typical example for the "**birthplace of stars**"
	 - Concentrate this matter in a small space and it will form a star

### Stars - Generalities
 - Massive celestial bodies consisting of ionized gas
	 - **Hydrogen**
	 - **Helium**
 - Their mass is so big, so they are permanently in danger of shrinking
	 - **Gravitational contraction**
