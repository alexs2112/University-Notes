### Igneous Rock Stratigraphy
 - Principle of Inclusions
	 - Layers of igneous rocks with inclusions of older layers
	 - Lavaflow picking up detached inclusions of older rocks before crystallizing
 - Principle of Cross-Cutting Relationships
	 - Long inclusion of a younger rock that cuts through an older igneous segment, forming nearly parallel lines (dikes)
	 - Second(+) generation dikes can cut through the older igneous segment along with the first generation dike, younger than both of them.
 - Relative Age of Lavaflows (and Sills)
	 - Layers of igenous rock are younger than the layers below, as the lava flow was so hot it cooked the younger layers beneath it.
		 - Can also cook layers above it, which means it is younger than both surrounding layers (formed by an intrusive rock, injection, cooking both sides)
	 - Sedimentary layers above the igneous rocks can have inclusions

### Geologic Time Scale
 - Four eons, youngest to oldest
 - **Phanerozoic** (Visible life forms)
	 - Begins with large size fossils, visible without a microscope
	 - Boundary between Phanerozoic and Proterozoic defined by massive event, agronomic revolution leading to massive diversification of the life forms on Earth
		 - Revolution generated by the formation of burrowers
		 - After this process, evolution takes over. Shortly after, evolution of the first global predator (due to large eyes of 360 degree vision)
	 - Consists of many subdivisions (as do the others, cover this one)
 - **Proterozoic** (Early life forms)
	 - Oldest fossils
	 - Longest in the Earth's history
	 - Around the Archean Proterozoic border, the continents began to move around the Asthenosphere (previously it just moved up and down)
		 - Asthenosphere currents started to push the continents around
		 - Modern plate tectonic regime began, first evidence that it started in the Indian Ocean
 - **Archean** (Oldest rocks)
	 - The boundary between Hadean and Archean is highly subjective, depends on the age of the oldest rocks we know (changes when we find older ones)
 - **Hadean** (No rock record)
	 - No more Hadean rocks on Earth
	 - Can't be subdivided, there are no rocks

### Phanerozoic Subdivisions
 - Three Eras, youngest to oldest, read backwards
 - Defined by the resemblance between life forms
 - **Cenozoic**
	 - Boundary marks the most severe crisis in the history of life
		 - Ocean conveyor collapsed, planetary ocean was transformed into a large swamp (no more movement between the layers of water)
		 - Temperature increased very quickly
		 - More than 95% of the species (aquatic and terrestrial) died, great dying
		 - One million years after, the Ocean Conveyor restarted and life recovered
	 - Extinction of the dinosaurs
	 - Eventual evolution of primates to take over
	 - Subdivided into three periods (oldest to youngest)
		 - Paleogene
		 - Neogene
		 - Quaternary
 - **Mesozoic**
	 - Flora and Fauna began to resemble modern life forms
	 - Mammals evolved, practically took over in Cenozoic
	 - Reptiles dominated wetter areas
	 - Life diversification
	 - Continuous planetary ocean driven by a giant "Ocean Conveyor" (one big current)
	 - Current forced all the continents together, Pangaea
	 - Subdivided into three periods (oldest to youngest)
		 - Triassic
		 - Jurassic
		 - Cretaceous
 - **Paleozoic**
	 - Very small resemblances between these fossils and organisms today
	 - Alien looking mfs
	 - Subdivided into seven Periods (oldest to youngest):
		 - Cambrian
			 - Whales
		 - Ordovician
			 - Ancient Welsh tribes
		 - Silurian
			 - Ancient Welsh tribes
		 - Devonian
			 - England, development of layers of rocks
		 - Mississippian
			 - Mississippi
		 - Pennsylvanian
			 - Pennsylvania
			 - These two are only recognized in North America
			 - Otherwise the two are Carboniferous (everywhere minus North America)
		 - Permian
			 - Russian city in the Euro Mountains (Perm)

### Radioactive Decay
 - Elements and isotopes in nature present different degrees of stability
 - An unstable isotope nucleus can be transformed spontaneously into an isotope with a stable nucleus configuration
	 - Unstable element changes to a stable state
 - This process is known as radioactive decay
 - Most elements transform over several steps, a radioactive decay series
	 - As you know the series of transformation, you can measure the weight of the parent and daughter isotope knowing the rate of transformation, you can calculate the age of the mineral (1912)

### Half-Life
 - The half-life of a radioactive element represents the time it takes for one half of the atoms of the original unstable parent element to decay to atoms of a new and more stable daughter element
 - Principle of measurement, charts and diagrams showing the ratios of change for each element over time. Not the method itself
 - Uranium 238 -> Lead 206 is the most relevant isotop pair, a half life of 4.5 billion years

### Geological Time Scale
 - With the knowledge of half-life and radioactive decay, we can calculate the age of the Earth with margins of error
