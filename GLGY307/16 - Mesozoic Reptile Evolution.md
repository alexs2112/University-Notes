### Aquatic Reptiles
 - Two distinct groups of marine reptiles in the Mesozoic times
 - Triassic: Placodonts (order Placodontia) and nothosaurs (order Sauropterygia)
	 - Placodonts:
		 - Triassic blunt-toothed shell crushers (broad inner teeth behind the outer teeth)
		 - Broad armor resulted in the appearance of a large turtle
			 - Bony structure on the bottom resembling ribs, protect ventral sides of the body from cutting edges of shells
	 - Nothosaurs:
		 - Example: Ceresiosaurus (2.2 meters long)
		 - Not fully aquatic, only plunged periodically in the water for food
 - Jurassic-Cretaceous: Plesiosaurs (order Sauropterygia) and ichthyosaurs (order Ichthyosauria)
	 - Plesiosaurs:
		 - Long necked fish eater, long neck to trick prey (undulating to disorient prey)
		 - Example: Futabasaurus (famous fossil in Japan)
	 - Ichthyosaurs:
		 - Fish lizards, top predators in the Jurassic and Cretaceous seas, relatively small  (few meters)
		 - Best adapted to the aquatic environment (similar to dolphins)
		 - Extremely fast, anterior paddle-like libs
		 - Large skull armor to protect the eyes, likely from other ichthyosaurs
		 - Example: Leptonectes
		 - A bunch of them were buried by underwater landslides, mother caught in process of giving birth
			 - Give birth to living offspring, no eggs
			 - Reproductive strategy close to dolphins and sharks

### Reptilian Non-Dinosaurian Flight - Pterosaurians
 - Evolved flight several times, not a single reptilian group
 - Pterosauria: Winged lizards
 - Includes circa 200 (now 400) species of flying reptiles that lived during the upper Triassic-Cretaceous stratigraphic interval
	 - Pterosaurian age corresponds to that of the dinosaurs
 - Most likely a polyphyletic group, defined by grouping together taxa that evolved iteratively the winged morphology
 - **Flight Capabilitiies**:
	 - Representatives were considered to be gliders from higher places
		 - Small-sized species likely used trees to start the gliding
		 - Larger ones started glided flight from a cliff or a falaise
	 - Originally thought their bodies would be too heavy, thinking in reptilian sense
		 - Turns out their bones were hollow, big creatures but very light
		 - Flight capabilities were reevaluated, demonstrated some species could have actively moved their wings during flight, making them highly maneuverable in the air
 - **Adaptations**:
	 - Hollow bones, lighter and occur in all groups that have flight capabilities
		 - Heads in the pterosaurian group are streamlind
	 - Body was covered with hair, as demonstrated in the case of *Sordes pilosus*, species from late Jurassic from Kazakhstan
		 - Very good preservation, portions of its body covered with fur
		 - Bodies covered with hair are clear indication that pterosaurians evolved endothermy
			 - Warm blooded
	 - Wings consisted of extended skin, attached to the modified arm skeletal elements over the whole length; wings could be moved through the action of massive pectoral muscles
 - Extremely diverse in terms of feeding:
	 - Dimorphodon: Insectivores, many thin and narrow teeth
	 - Rhamphorhynchus: Fish eaters, like seagulls, hair on the beak and claws
	 - Ctenochasma: Fed on plankton at the surface of the ocean, skimmed it off the top
	 - Pteranodon: Very streamlined head, no teeth, large beak like a pelican, swallowing fish whole

# Terrestrial Reptiles
### Triassic Diapsid Takeover
 - Most significant change in reptilian faunas of the Triassic was the overall replacement of the synapsids by diapsids
 - Earliest diapsids evolved in the Carboniferous
	 - Oldest genus: Petrolacosaurus, small sized insectivore
 - Not among the flourishing and dominant reptiles of Carboniferous and Permian, but colonized a variety of environments, adopting different feeding strategies
 - Diversification began in the late Permian, two major groups evolved in the Traissic:
	 - Lepidosaurs (lizards, snakes, etc)
	 - Archosaurs (crocodiles, etc)
 - Two main groups are formalized as Lepidosauromorpha and Archosauromorpha

### Lepidosauromorphs
 - Remained terrestrial and quadrupedal since their evolution in the early Triassic
	 - Not among the dominant reptiles in the Mesozoic
 - Squamates (order Squamata): Lizards and snakes
 - Squamates evolved in the Jurassic, became diversified at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary
	 - Evolved gigantism (Titanoboa: 1m tall, 100ft/30m long, probably fish eater, size for warm climate)

### Superorder Dinosauria
 - **Generalities**:
	 - Group of Mesozoic reptiles, evolved in the Triassic
	 - Typically diapsid, from a strict morphological point of view present similarities with the crocodilians and birds
		 - Evolved to have more sophisticated skulls, larger number of holes
	 - In Jurassic and Cretaceous, dinosaurs were the dominant land vertebrates, evolution resulted in the occurrence of some of the largest animals in the life history on Earth
 - **Classification**:
	 - Fundamental structure in the skeleton is the form and orientation of the pubis bone
		 - Significant contribution in deciphering the dinosaurian evolution and classification
	 - Two groups of dinosaurs: Orders Saurischia and Ornithischia (somewhat birdlike and lizardlike)
	![[dinosaur_orders.png|400]]
 - **Saurischian Dinosaurs**:
	 - Present pubis bone oriented downward and forward from the articulation from the ilium and ischium (other two bones in the pelvic girdle)
	 - Divided into three suborders:
		 - Staurikosauria
		 - Theropoda
		 - Sauropodomorpha
	 - Name indicates that the pelvic girdle of the dinosaurid group has resemblances to that of the modern lizards
 - **Ornithischian Dinosaurs**:
	 - Pelvic girdle with the pubis bone in verntral position, parallel to the ischium that is extended backwards
	 - Five suborders included in this order:
		 - Ornithopoda
		 - Pachycephalosauria
		 - Stegosauria
		 - Anklyosauria
		 - Ceratopsida
 - **Earliest Dinosaurs**:
	 - Originally small, the size of turtles, mostly as prey for other animals at the time
	 - Eventually gave birth to larger ones, extremely diverse
	![[earliest_dinosaurs.png|500]]
 - **Stratigraphical Distribution**:
	![[dinosaur_distributions.png|450]]
 - **Suborder Staurikosauria:
	 - Earliest dinosaurs were bipedal small carnivores (2-4 meters)
		 - Two late Triassic earlier dinosaurs are Staurikosaurus (Brazil) and Herrerasaurus (Argentina)
		 - Anterior limbs are very well developed with well developed claws, used for hunting
	 - Pelvic girdle presents resemblances with those of their thecodont ancestors
	 - Discoveries in all the continents indicate the representatives of this group were highly adaptable since the beginning of dinosaur evolution
 - **Suborder Theropoda**:
	 - Theropods are carnivorous dinosaurs of variable size, ranging from 1 meter (Microraptor) to over 15 meters (Tyrannosaurus, Gigantosaurus)
	 - Bipedal, capable to run at very high speeds, some species able to run over 40km/h
		 - Larger species (Tyrannosaurus Rex) could not run as fast
	 - Major predators equipped with strong jaws and teeth
		 - Backward oriented teeth to prevent prey from escaping
		 - Dentition shows no specialization for chewing
	 - Large sized heads with equally developed musculature (many skull openings) indicate these predators were capable of breaking bones of the prey, not only slicing soft tissues
	 - Examples: Tyrannosaurus, Dromaeosaurus, Caudipteryx
		 - Caudipteryx: Bird tail, as small as a turkey, part of the group that gave birth to birds
 - **Suborder Sauropodomorpha**:
	 - Largest animals evolved on Earth, some species weighed over 70 tons
	 - Vast majority were herbivores, some of the earliest members could have been occasional meat eaters
	 - Occasionally bipedal, starting in Jurassic they became quadrupedal
		 - Prosauropoda (late Triassic-Early Jurassic)
		 - Sauropoda (Jurassic-Cretaceous)
	 - Usually very long neck, very slow body, small brain
	 - Used to swallow some rocks to help digestion
	 - Examples: Plateosaurus, Ultrasaurus
 - **Ornithischians - Ornithopoda**:
	 - Oldest of the Ornithischians
	 - Herbivore dinosaurs with the dentition modified for chewing, occupied the same ecological niches as the modern herbivore mammals
	 - Earlier Ornithopods were small sized (1-2m in length), attained larger sizes (12 m) later in group evolution
	 - Bipedal and quadrupedal, two types of locomotion occurring in the same species
	 - Back limbs were stronger than the fore limbs, capable of running at speeds of 15-20 km/h
	 - Examples: Iguanodon, Hypacrosaurus, Camptosaurus, Hadrosaurus, Edmontosaurus
		 - Iguanodon: Skull of a duck with a beak, labyrinthic internal structure of their skulls used to create air currents, producing sounds to communicate between different individuals/mating
 - **Ornithischians - Pachycephalosauria**:
	 - Cretaceous ornithischians, characterized by the thickened skull roof
		 - Dinosaurs with a thick head
	 - Bipedal and herbivores
	 - Thickened skull roof was most likely used as a battering ram
		 - First interpretation: Bonking heads, trying to fight over females for mating
		 - Now: Adaptation for defense against theropods
	 - Evolutionary origins are not precisely known
	 - Examples: Stegaceras, Pachycephalosaurus
 - **Ornithischians - Stegosauria**:
	 - Quadrupedal, medium-sized herbivores of Jurassic and early Cretaceous age, as long as 9 meters
	 - Present osteoderms (plates, spines, spikes), larger spines occur in the tail distal portion
		 - Original: Defense against bites of predators
		 - Now: Body thermoregulation
		 - Large tail spines used for defense to inflict deadly wounds
	 - Small brain, with a smaller brain in the spine to coordinate the body
	 - Osteoderms in the skin present a system of blood vessels, considered that these structures were used for the body thermoregulation
	 - Travelled in packs of 5 or 6, would easily be able to take down a very large lone predator if needed
 - **Ornithischians - Anklyosauria**:
	 - Cretaceous quadrupedal herbivores that had the body covered by bony plates in the skin
		 - Continuous armor-like structure on the back of the body
	 - Tail is thickened at the end with a club-like structure, used for defense
	 - Ankylosaurus is the typical genus of this suborder
		 - Other example: Euoplocephalus
 - **Ornithischians - Ceratopsida**:
	 - Best adapted for defense
	 - Late Cretaceous quadrupedal and chewing herbivores, skull protected by a shield (cephalic shield) that extends backwards to the shoulders
		 - Can present anterior horns
		 - Can be used for both attack and defense
	 - Could be as long as ten meters
	 - Examples: Triceratops, Paraceratops, Chasmosaurs

# Reptilian Dinosaurian Flight, Evolution of Birds
### Ancestors of Birds
 - Evolved in the Late Mesozoic from the dinosaurid ancestors
	 - More precisely, from a group known as theropods
 - Earliest reptiles with avian features are known in the late Jurassic, close ancestors to birds did not evolve until the early Cretaceous (ornithuromorpha)
	 - Real birds didn't evolve until the Cenozoic
	 - Don't know where the exact boundary is between reptiles and birds
		 - Safest interpretation: Birds evolved when all the avian features were achieved (Paleocene)
 - Preavian Theropods: Theropods with some avian features, not all of them
 - Ornithuromorpha: Greek -> reptiles with bird form, not the first real birds yet
![[bird_fossil_groups.png|200]]

### Archaeopteryx Lithographica
 - Famous specimen exhibited in Berlin, missing link between reptiles and birds (feathered reptile)
 - General body plan of a reptile, but with feathers
 - Species presents mixed features of reptiles (tail, anterior members with claws, beak with teeth, etc) and birds (feathers)
	 - Bones have wide hollow spaces, indicate the possibility of flight, not entirely hollow like birds
 - Dominant body features show strong similarities with a number of smaller groups of theropod reptiles
 - Additionally studies show it was not capable of avian flight, feathers primarily developed to maintain high body temperature (endothermy) and only secondary for flight
	 - Some scientists think it was a glider
 - Examples: Archaeopteryx, Microraptor
	 - Microraptor from China, allow us to infer lifestyle from their organic debris
 - **Feathers**:
	 - Comparison with feather morphology in archaeopteryx lithographica with modern birds is practically identical (significant resemblances)
	 - No doubt that these are the ancestors of the birds
	 - Feathers did not evolve much in 150 million years

### Origins of Bird Flight
 - Two hypotheses that try to explain the flapped flight origin:
 - **Arboreal Hypothesis**: Tries to explain the flight origin from the small-sized non-flying reptiles that glided from the trees
 - **Cursorial Hypothesis**: Tries to explain the evolution of flight from the fast running animals, which developed flapped flight on short distances in an attempt to avoid obstacles at the ground level

### Earliest Bird-Like Organisms
 - Morphological transition from theropods to modern bird body plan happened throughout the Late Jurassic and Cretaceous
 - Closest relatives of the modern birds are included within the Cretaceous group *ornithuromorpha*
	 - Often referred to as birds
	 - Many of them, examples: Hesperornis, Patagoptryx, Vorona
	 - None of them have all of the features required to be a bird
 - Confuciusornis: ???
 - Parahesperornis: Resembled modern birds???
 - Diatryma: Giant bird with huge head
 - Apteryx: Kiwi Bird

### Transition to Birds
Involves a variety of morphological changes in the skeleton:
 - Disappearance of teeth
 - Evolution of the pygostyle that supports the tail muscles
 - Toe rearrangement (three to the front, one situated backwards), loss of the fifth toe
 - Evolution of pneumatic bones (completely hollow)
 - Keeled downward projected sternum (chest bone, extremely wide and powerful muscles for flying)
 - Loss of some vertebrae, more flexible vertebral column
 - Feathers cover most of the body surface
