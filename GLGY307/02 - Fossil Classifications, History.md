### Fossils and Subfossils
 - Remains of older life forms, vestiges of once living organisms
 - Process of transformation is fossilization
 - Fossils and Subfossils (younger), threshold at 11700 years
	 - End of the last ice age on Earth (memorize)

### Hard and Soft Body Parts
 - Two structures found in fossils
 - Mineralized hard body parts, fossilize easier than soft body parts
 - Soft body parts can be protected, preserved, and fossilized
	 - Rapid burial preserves the soft body, carapaces can protect it

### Kinds of Fossils
 - **Body Fossils** represent partially, completely fossilized dead organisms. Most frequent kind of fossils
 - **Trace Fossils** preserve organism activities, such as feeding or movement
 - **Chemical Fossils** (biomarkers) are chemical substances resulting from the reactions between the substances of a living/dead organism and the minerals, other substances from the surrounding environment

# History of Fossil Interpretation
### Greek Rationalism
 - Xenophanes of Colophon (495-435 BC): First fossils reported in southern Italy and interpreted as part of science
 - Xanthus of Lydia (450 BC): New reports from Lesser Asia
 - Publius Ovidius Naso (43 BC - 18 AD): Extended observations in the western part of the Black Sea, wrote works in exile about finding anchors of ancient ships
 - Lucius Apuleius (125-180 AD): Described first fossil fish in northern Africa

### Glossopetrae
 - "Stoned Tongues" stones that fell from the moon during an eclipse
 - During the Dark Ages, science was not developed during this time

### First Illustrated Fossils
 - Georg Bauer (1494-1555): Fossils interpreted as figured stones, important guy at the time and his thoughts were adopted without criticism
 - Christophorus Encelius (1513-1583): *On the Metallic Objects*, new book returning to antiquity interpretations that fossils are ancient life forms.
	 - First illustrated fossils

### First Monographic Study on Fossils
 - Conrad Gesner (1516-1565): *De Rerum Fossilium*, About the Fossil Objects, Book containing illustrations of fossils in a systemic way
 - Fossil: in latin is an object that was dug up from the Earth
	 - Everything that was dug up from the Earth, slow changes in the meaning eventually gave it its current form
	 - This book contains a bunch of other non-fossil in it, lots of general rocks and minerals

### Paleontology and its Subdivisions
- Micropaleontology: Microscopical debris of organisms
- Paleoalgology: Vestiges of ancient algae
- Palynology: Vestiges of reproductive organisms of higher plants (spores)
- Paleobotany: Studies ancient plants
- Vertebrate Paleontology: Organisms with skeletons
- Invertebrate Paleontology: Organisms without skeletons
**Related Sciences**
 - Paleoecology: Represents studies of the ecology of the ancient organisms and their relationships with the inorganic and organic components of their environment
 - Paleobiogeography: Studies the distribution in spaces of organisms, bio-provinces
 - Biostratigraphy: Distribution of fossils in space and time
 - Evolutionary Paleontology: Studies the evolutionary relationships between organisms
