### Prehistoric Signs of Religious Thought
 - Burials with stone tools, shells, animal bones
 - Cave paintings with animals and abstract images
 - Venus figuring sculptures

**Origins - Paleolithic**:
 - 100-25 kya
 - Deliberate and meticulous care of burying dead, ceremony
 - Dead were buried in a fetal position, return to the womb

**Bavarian Grave**:
 - 27 human skulls found in a group, embedded in red ochre, skulls looking westward
	 - Second identical group of six skulls, heads severed from body after death (flint knives)
 - Skulls in the center were tightly packed together and crushed
	 - Added one by one from time to time
 - Twenty of the skulls were of children, ornamented with snail shells
 - Nine were of women with deer teeth necklaces
 - Four were adult males

**Cro-Magnons**: (25 - 10 kya)
 - First idols found were of female deities
	 - Interest in fertility, concept of mother goddess as fecundity motif
 - Other burial sites: Certain shells (cowrie) were shaped in the form of a portal through which a child enters the world
	 - Sympathetic magic
 - During this time, widespread custom of placing ochreous powder on the body
	 - Red was the colour of life, placing red ochre on body suggests belief in life to come
 - Painting of body with red ochre was the first mummification, attempt to make the body serviceable again
 - Some burial spots suggest the living were making offerings to the dead out of fear and awe of them

**Mesolithic Period**: (Middle Stone Age, 15-7 kya)
 - Transitional age, vanishing of ice sheets and gradual shift from nomadic to village life
 - Brittany, France: Great ossuary with ten burial sites, remains of 23 individuals
	 - Placed in a specific way with many ornaments, covered in red ochre
	 - Appears the bodies were clothed where they were interred
 - Denmark: Continuation of extended burial in earth graves defined by small ring of small stones around the body
	 - Covered with a large earth mound known as dyssens or dolmans

**Neolithic Period**: (New Stone Age, 10-2 kya)
 - Characterized by several great changes
	 - Early forms of agriculture, active tilling of soil
	 - Domestication of animals, gathering into flocks and herds
	 - Advances in arts of pottery, plaiting, weaving, sewing
	 - Establishment of settled communities with an accompanying growth of population
	 - Invention of wheeled cart
	 - First surgery
 - Religion is also being radically transformed
	 - Mother Goddess or Great Goddess of earlier hunting culture associated with creation and regeneration
	 - Female divine power went beyond the animal models of birthing and nurture to the watering, tending, and protecting of the whole world of vegetation
	 - Studies of Old Europe (Balkans) reveal a pantheon of mostly female deities
		 - Later obscured, but not fully displaced by later Indo-Aryan patriachal and gender-polarized views

### Early Historic Period, Axial Age
 - Rise of early trade routes
 - Technological advancements
	 - Invention of writing in Sumer and Egypt
	 - Invention of the Wheel
 - Pyramid Texts (Egypt): Oldest known religious texts (2400-3200 BCE)
 - Axial Age: 900-200 BCE
	 - Broad changes, seemingly parallel development in religious and philosophical thought
	 - Variety of locations from 8th-3rd century BCE
	 - Rise of Confucianism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism, Jainism + Indian Philosophy, Buddha and Buddhism, Platonic Philosophy all appeared at the same time

**Greece**:
 - Study of religions seems to have originated with the Greeks
 - Herodotus (5th century BCE): Father of history, first began to document the chronology of the past
 - Epicurus (341-270 BCE): A radical critic of religion, sought to catalog and explain the sense of the sacred
 - Stoics (3rd century BCE): Believed there was a common denominator of sacred behind all religion

**4th Century BCE**:
 - Birth of Christ somehow
 - Month of his birth is debatable, also year, another reason to use CE and BCE instead of AD, BC

**Rome**:
 - Romans also studied religion
 - Cicero (106-43 BCE): Concerned with the word "religion" (in Latin) and was first to use the term in relation to "proper performance of rites in veneration of the gods"
 - Seneca, Tacitus, Julius Caesar (1st century BCE): All interested in the study
	 - Caesar: "Obligation of an oath"
 - After Christianity emerged, study of different religions was neglected as the church was more concerned with its own mission and survival

**Europe**:
 - Technological, intellectual, aesthetic development was thriving in China, India, Arab World, and Italian City States
 - Land and sea routes like the Silk Road connected the great cities of these regions to foster cultural and economic exchange
 - A few major events were responsible for the rise and expansion of European societies after 1400
	 - Withdrawal of China from the world trade networks
	 - Exploratory voyage of Vasco Da Gama around the southern tip of Africa
	 - Columbus' exploratory voyage to the Western Hemisphere
 - Gutenberg credited with inventing the moveable type printing press around 1450
	 - Monumental impact on European culture
		 - Books, newspapers, pamphlets, etc. became available and affordable
	 - Gutenberg Bible, also known as the 42-line Bible, was the earliest major book printed in Europe during mass produced metal movable type
	 - Fostered escalation of literacy and education among common peoples
		 - Stimulated more independent thought, social dialogue, and debate

**Atlantic World**:
 - 1500: Atlantic World dominated by Europe, based in trade of sugar, slaves, gold, silver
 - Lucrative endeavors, European societies began to acquire great wealth and power
 - Spreading Christianity was an integral aspect of this European expansion

**1517: Protestant Reformation**
 - Movement in Europe beginning with Martin Luther's opposition to the corruption of Catholicism
 - Divided Christianity between Catholicism and a number of Protestant denominations
 - Contributed to a sociocultural milieu in Europe
	 - Fostered science, technology, modern philosophy, capitalism

**1648: Westphalia Peace Accord**
 - Considered to be the culmination of the Protestant Reformation
 - Established national boundaries in Europe
 - Ended political dominance of the Holy Roman Empire
 - Instigated the transformation in the political organization of European powers from feudal states to nation states

**1500s-1700s: European Age of Scientific Discovery**
 - First Phase:
	 - *Empiricism*: Scientific knowledge can be acquired through observing phenomena
	 - *Mechanical Philosophy*: Nature follows natural, physical laws
	 - *Chemical Philosophy*: Matter functions according to active, vital principles
	 - *Mathematization*: Quantitative methods were applied to the measurement of physical phenomena
 - Second Phase: Application of empirical analysis and mechanistic explanations to:
	 - Human Personality
	 - Human Development
	 - Cultures, societies and their development

**1700s: European Enlightenment**
 - Concept of *self-rule* replaces *divine right* of kings to rule over society
	 - Humanistic ideas about freedom, equality, right to happiness in this life emerge
	 - Science develops in opposition to religion
 - Assertion that "god hath created all men equal" morphs into "nature hath created all men equal"

**Deism**:
 - A pure "natural religion"
 - Flourished from 1690s-1740s, seemed to die out by 1800s, some principles still found in Unitarianism
 - Belief that reason and observation of natural world are sufficient to determine the existence of a divine creator
 - Creator God made the world, leaves it to operate according to natural laws
	 - Parallel set of moral laws to guide human conduct, promise of an afterlife that rewards good and punishes evil
 - Sought to demystify religion, does not rely on revelation or religious authority
 - According to believers: Religion of the very first humans, best hope for humanity is that it be revived and practiced universally, as a "brotherhood" by all peoples throughout the globe

### Late 1700s - Early 1900s: Age of Imperialism
 - Industrial Revolution: Scientific and technological advances applied to agriculture, transportation, industry
 - Relationship of technology and capitalism resulted in an exponential increase in the production of goods
 - Raw materials, new markets, and cheap or slave labour were required for this increase production
 - European powers embarked upon a second era of imperial expansion in order to control the material and human resources of other societies throughout the globe

**Constructing and Controlling the "Other"**:
 - European elites constructed the "other" they sought to dominate
	 - In turn, Europeans shaped their identities in contrast to the "other"
 - Methods of control included:
	 - Religious conversion
	 - Military force
	 - Collecting knowledge about the colonized to facilitate domination

**Charles Darwin**: (1809 - 1882)
 - *The Origin of Species*, 1859
 - "Much light will be shed on the origin of man (sic) and his history" (p. 459)
 - Darwin's biological studies of evolution paralleled an interest in social evolution that produced a body of knowledge that later supported social, economic, and political studies

**Social Evolution**:
 - Theory developed by *Herbert Spencer* when he applied new scientific discoveries to the study of different societies
	 - Survival of the fittest
 - This theory placed the world's societies on an evolutionary scale of primitive to civilized

**Scientific Racism**:
 - Based on faulty science and fabricated data
 - Divided humans into different races based on biological differences
	 - Racial categories were then situated on an evolutionary hierarchy
	 - Young Chimpanzee -> Black Person -> White Person
 - In actuality, race is a social construction with no biological foundation

**19th Century Characteristics**:
 - Industrial Revolution
 - Science
 - Positism
 - Rationalism - Reason
 - Rapid Change
 - Progress
 - Age of Empire
 - Philosophy of History
 - Christianity under Attack

### E. B. Tylor
 - 1832 - 1917
 - Social evolutionist (armchair anthropologist)
 - Asserted that the development of religions from one stage to the next is universal throughout the world's cultures
 - Deeply anti-Catholic
 - *Primitive Culture* (1871)
	 - Wanted to account for the origin of religion and trace its developmental history
	 - Put himself in the "shoes of a primitive man" to understand how "primitive" people would understand the world
 - According to Tylor, "ancient savage philosophers" were concerned with two groups of biological problems:
	 - What is it that makes the difference between a living body and a dead one, what causes sleep, trance, disease, death?
	 - What are these human shapes which appear in dreams and visions?
 - Their explanation that he came up with:
	 - A spirit or soul, derived from the experience of human souls or spirits in "dreams and waking hallucinations" is thought to "animate" lifeless objects such as sticks or stones, mountains, rivers, etc

**Tylor's minimal definition of religion**:
 - "Belief in spiritual beings" = Animism (latin *anima*, breath or soul)
 - Notion of spirits was not the outcome of irrational thinking
 - "Primitive man" was a rationalist and a scientific philosopher
 - Preliterate religious beliefs and practices were not ridiculous or a rubbish heap of miscellaneous folly
 - Essentially consistent and logical, based on rational thinking and empirical knowledge

**Evolutionary Schema**:
1. Animism
	 - In preliterate cultures - animals, plants, and inanimate objects are endowed with souls
2. Polytheism
	 - The idea of multiple spiritual beings to explain natural events and phenomena
	 - Belief in more than one god
3. Monotheism
	 - Belief in one god
	 - Animism of civilized man
 - **Morality**: Religious beliefs underwent a moral transformation
	 - Initial focus on individual well-being/self-interest shifted towards more altruistic and moral social concerns
	 - Selfishness -> Altruism
 - **Afterlife**: Continuance doctrine of life after death replaced by the "retribution doctrine"
	 - Rewards or punishments based on actions during lifetime

**Critiques**:
 - Idea of "Primitive Monotheism"
 - Andrew Lang: *The Making of Religion* (1898)
	 - Conception of "high God" evident in many tribal communities (Great Manitou)
 - Father Wilhelm Schmidt: *The Origin and Growth of Religion* (1912)
	 - Monotheism evident among the most "archaic" peoples (Tasmanian and Andaman Islanders)
	 - Such beliefs had later become overlaid with polytheistic conceptions

### Robert Marett (1866 - 1943)
 - Anthropologist
 - Argued that the notion of animism was not the most basic religious conception
 - Origins of religion were to be found in the idea of an impersonal supernatural force present everywhere and in specific people/objects
	 - *Orenda* among the Iroquois
	 - *Mana* in Melanesia
 - Since it was simpler, it was a more ancient religious idea
	 - A pre-animism stage of religion
	 - Animatism
 - Savage religion was "something not so much thought out as danced out"

### Sir James Frazer (1854-1951)
 - A Scottish ethnologist
 - *The Golden Bough* (1890-1915, 12 volumes)
	 - Compares the myths, magical practices, and religions of the world's cultures throughout history
	 - Named after the golden bough in the sacred grove at Nemi, near Rome
 - Traced the evolution of human behaviour, ancient and primitive myth, magic, religion, ritual, and taboo

**Frazer's The Golden Bough**:
 - Sacred groves that were exclusive to priests or kings, in order to challenge the current "owner" of the grove you would have to pluck the golden bough.
	 - Single combat commences, winner becomes the new guardian of the grove
	 - Sacrifice of the previous guardian was necessary to help everyone else in the community
 - Frazer argued that many myths and rituals revolved around a god or king who undergoes a sacrificial death, often to ensure the well-being of the community
 - Dying and resurrecting is often associated with vegetation symbolism
	 - God's death and rebirth are cycles of nature, such as the changing of seasons and growth of crops
 - Examined various rituals, customs, and myths from different cultures
	 - Drawing parallels between them, suggesting that these were common human impulses to ensure continuity of life through symbolic acts of death and rebirth
	 - Christians were upset about this as the sacrifice of their Christ was no longer unique, did not like being compared to primitive cultures

**Sympathetic Magic**:
 - Based on the principle that "like produces like", or the law of similarity
	 - Causal relationship between things that appear to be similar
 - For instance: Whatever happens to an image of someone will also happen to them
	 - Voodoo dolls in the folk tradition of Haiti
	 - Referred to as imitative magic

**Contagious Magic**:
 - Based on the principle that things or persons once conjoined and then separated still are connected, can afterward influence each other
	 - Believers must take special precaution with their hair, fingernails, teeth, clothes, feces, etc
	 - Thought to retain a magical sympathy with the person they originate from
 - If they fell into the wrong hands, magic could be performed on them which would cause the person they came from to be affected
	 - Tooth knocking-out ceremony of the Aranda Tribe, takes out the front teeth of someone to put it somewhere safe

**Frazer Social Evolutionary Model**:
 - Magic -> Religion -> Science
 - Asserted Australian Aborigines were the most primitive of all because they practiced *only magic*
	 - What he defined their spirituality as
 - Magic, according to Frazer, is logically more primitive than religion
	 - Concept of personal agents (religion) is more complex than ideas around similarity or cause and effect (magic)
