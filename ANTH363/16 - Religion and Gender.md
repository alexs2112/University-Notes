### The Veil and Western Views of Muslim Women
 - Loblaw's "Memories of Marrakech" couscous (woman in niqab with heavy eyeliner)
	 - Product purposely associated with Morocco, couscous is a grain commonly associated with the Middle East
	 - Other images could have been used to represent Morocco
	 - Why use an image of a woman wearing a niqab for selling grain?
	 - President's Choice used Orientalist thinking to sell this
 - These stereotypes based on the way Muslim women dress persist to the present day
	 - Underlie many images seen in advertising
### Orientalism
 - *Orientalism* by Edward Said (1978)
 - Western scholarship on the Middle East = an ideological tool of domination
 - The West defines itself in opposition to a romantic other
 - Images of the oriental: Exotic, dangerous, feminine, distant, subordinate, wild
	 - *Orient* (latin - rising or east) in French sense, implying the "Middle" East as well as the Far East, vs. Occident = west
 - Great Exhibition (1851): European travellers taking objects and artifacts from western nations to put on display

**Orientalism in the Victorian Era**:
 - Orientalism not only affected perceptions of Eastern cultures in general
	 - Specifically influenced views on roles, behaviours, and statuses of women in these cultures
 - Eastern women were often depicted as exotic and sensual in Victorian literature, art, travelogues
	 - Particularly those in the Ottoman Empire, Persia, and broader Muslim world
	 - Harem baths and pools, women at the door
 - These portrayals were largely fictional and served to reinforce stereotypes
 - Homa Hoodfar: 18h, 19th century Western depictions of Muslim women often showed them living in harems
	 - Supposed to be imprisoned by their husbands
	 - Had nothing to do all day except beautify themselves and cater to their husband's huge sexual appetite
 - Vintage North African Postcards:
	 - Colonists made postcards using props to show how Muslim women dressed
	 - Eroticized them, portrayed them as submissive yet inaccessible
 - Contrasted with Victorian women, who were buried in clothes

**Creating the Orient**:
 - According to Said, the orientalist (even a well-intentioned one) "creates" the Orient
	 - Through writing, serves to legitimize and perpetuate interests of Western Imperialism
 - Helps in creation of series of stereotypical images
	 - Europe (the West, the "self") is seen as being essentially rational, developed, humane, superior, virtuous, normal, masculine
	 - While the Orient (the East, "other") is seen as being irrational, backward, despotic, inferior, depraved, aberrant, and feminine sexually
 - The Orient as a monolith

**East/West Binaries**:
 - Good/Evil, Black/White, Modernity/Tradition, Exotic/Ordinary, Reason/Dogma, Cruel/Gentle
 - Progressive/Backwards, Democracy/Despotism, Civilization/Medievalism, Sensual/Chaste
 - Rational/Irrational, Liberty/Servitude, Effete/Masculine, Degenerate/Moral, Civilized/Barbaric

**Orientalism**:
 - These contrasting images served to reinforce Western superiority and justify colonial endeavors
 - "Orientalism can be discussed and analyzed as the corporate institution for dealing with the Orient-dealing with it by making statements about it, authorizing views of it, describing it, by teaching it, settling it, ruling over it: in short, Orientalism as a Western style for dominating, restructuring, and having authority over the Orient"  - Said
 - Literature: Rudyard Kipling's poem *The White Man's Burden* (1899)
	 - Colonial mindset, portraying East as uncivilized
	 - Needs Western intervention to civilize the native peoples
 - Cinema: Films *The Sheik* (1921) & *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962) perpetuated Orientalist stereotypes
	 - Presenting the East as a place of exoticism, danger, sensuality
	 - Also reinforcing notion of heroic Westerner who brings order and civilization to the region
 - News Coverage and Magazine depictions
	 - Veiled women representing all of islam
	 - Western media still portrays the East, particularly the Middle East, as a region of conflict, terrorism, and religious extremism
	 - Reinforces negative stereotypes and justifying Western intervention
 - Modern Western views on Muslim women often continue to be influenced by stereotypes rooted in Orientalist thought, including assumptions of oppression, passivity, need for liberation
