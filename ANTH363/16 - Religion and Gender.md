### The Veil and Western Views of Muslim Women
 - Loblaw's "Memories of Marrakech" couscous (woman in niqab with heavy eyeliner)
	 - Product purposely associated with Morocco, couscous is a grain commonly associated with the Middle East
	 - Other images could have been used to represent Morocco
	 - Why use an image of a woman wearing a niqab for selling grain?
	 - President's Choice used Orientalist thinking to sell this
 - These stereotypes based on the way Muslim women dress persist to the present day
	 - Underlie many images seen in advertising
### Orientalism
 - *Orientalism* by Edward Said (1978)
 - Western scholarship on the Middle East = an ideological tool of domination
 - The West defines itself in opposition to a romantic other
 - Images of the oriental: Exotic, dangerous, feminine, distant, subordinate, wild
	 - *Orient* (latin - rising or east) in French sense, implying the "Middle" East as well as the Far East, vs. Occident = west
 - Great Exhibition (1851): European travellers taking objects and artifacts from western nations to put on display

**Orientalism in the Victorian Era**:
 - Orientalism not only affected perceptions of Eastern cultures in general
	 - Specifically influenced views on roles, behaviours, and statuses of women in these cultures
 - Eastern women were often depicted as exotic and sensual in Victorian literature, art, travelogues
	 - Particularly those in the Ottoman Empire, Persia, and broader Muslim world
	 - Harem baths and pools, women at the door
 - These portrayals were largely fictional and served to reinforce stereotypes
 - Homa Hoodfar: 18h, 19th century Western depictions of Muslim women often showed them living in harems
	 - Supposed to be imprisoned by their husbands
	 - Had nothing to do all day except beautify themselves and cater to their husband's huge sexual appetite
 - Vintage North African Postcards:
	 - Colonists made postcards using props to show how Muslim women dressed
	 - Eroticized them, portrayed them as submissive yet inaccessible
 - Contrasted with Victorian women, who were buried in clothes

**Creating the Orient**:
 - According to Said, the orientalist (even a well-intentioned one) "creates" the Orient
	 - Through writing, serves to legitimize and perpetuate interests of Western Imperialism
 - Helps in creation of series of stereotypical images
	 - Europe (the West, the "self") is seen as being essentially rational, developed, humane, superior, virtuous, normal, masculine
	 - While the Orient (the East, "other") is seen as being irrational, backward, despotic, inferior, depraved, aberrant, and feminine sexually
 - The Orient as a monolith

**East/West Binaries**:
 - Good/Evil, Black/White, Modernity/Tradition, Exotic/Ordinary, Reason/Dogma, Cruel/Gentle
 - Progressive/Backwards, Democracy/Despotism, Civilization/Medievalism, Sensual/Chaste
 - Rational/Irrational, Liberty/Servitude, Effete/Masculine, Degenerate/Moral, Civilized/Barbaric

**Orientalism**:
 - These contrasting images served to reinforce Western superiority and justify colonial endeavors
 - "Orientalism can be discussed and analyzed as the corporate institution for dealing with the Orient-dealing with it by making statements about it, authorizing views of it, describing it, by teaching it, settling it, ruling over it: in short, Orientalism as a Western style for dominating, restructuring, and having authority over the Orient"  - Said
 - Literature: Rudyard Kipling's poem *The White Man's Burden* (1899)
	 - Colonial mindset, portraying East as uncivilized
	 - Needs Western intervention to civilize the native peoples
 - Cinema: Films *The Sheik* (1921) & *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962) perpetuated Orientalist stereotypes
	 - Presenting the East as a place of exoticism, danger, sensuality
	 - Also reinforcing notion of heroic Westerner who brings order and civilization to the region
 - News Coverage and Magazine depictions
	 - Veiled women representing all of islam
	 - Western media still portrays the East, particularly the Middle East, as a region of conflict, terrorism, and religious extremism
	 - Reinforces negative stereotypes and justifying Western intervention
 - Modern Western views on Muslim women often continue to be influenced by stereotypes rooted in Orientalist thought, including assumptions of oppression, passivity, need for liberation

**Quran and Veiling**:
 - Hijab: More abstract sense of partition, curtain, or veil rather than referring to a specific type of clothing as covering
 - That holy text addresses "the faithful women" who are told to shield their private parts and not to display their adornment "except what is apparent of it"
 - Scholarly disputes revolve around what this last phrase means
	 - Does it refer to outer surface of a woman's garments to cover every part of her body?
		 - Full niqab
	 - Or does it give an exemption referring to the face and the hands, as well as conventional female ornaments such as kohl, rings, bracelets, makeup
- The latter interpretation has been adopted by some of the most prominent scholars from Islamic history who favor the hijab (headscarf) option
- There are additional Quranic instructions for women to draw the "khimar" (scarf) to cover the "jayb" (bosom/upper chest) and for women to draw their "jalabib" (cloaks) close round them
	- Ambiguous and therefore much debated
- Is the hijab a symbol of oppression or a symbol of freedom

**Orientalist Feminism**:
 - Type of feminism that advocates and supports particular foreign policies towards middle east
 - It assumes a binary opposition between the West and the Orient (progress vs tradition)
 - Regards Oriental women only as victims, not as agents of social transformation
	 - Muslim women need saviours, their Western sisters to liberate them
 - Assumes that all societies in the Orient are the same and all Muslim women there live under the same conditions
 - Is it discrimination to ban women covering their face in public?
	 - Or is it liberation and attempt to move them from the cultural requirement that they be subservient to men
	 - Should wearing a burqa in public be banned

### France
 - 2004: Bans overt religious symbols in state/public schools
	 - Including Islamic hijabs, Jewish kippas, and large Christian crosses
 - 2010: Ban on the wearing of face covering headgear, masks, helmets, balaclavas, niqabs, and other veils covering the face in public places, except under specified circumstances
 - Grounded in the country's principle of *laicite* (secularism) which seeks to maintain a clear separation between state and religion
 - Prevent religious symbols from being worn in educational settings
	 - Where they could potentially influence the secular environment
 - Although the law applies to all religious symbols, it has been particularly contentious in relation to Islamic dress

**Critiques**:
 - Critics of these policies argue that they infringe on individual rights to express religious beliefs and disproportionately impact Muslims
 - The bans have been seen as contributing to the discrimination and isolating the Muslim population
 - Measures can hinder integration rather than promote secularism and equality
 - The targeting of Muslim women, in particular, has raised concerns about gender discrimination and the violation of women's rights to freedom of expression and religion

**Bill 21 Quebec's Secularism Law**:
 - Quebec is the first jurisdiction in North America with a law prohibiting women who wear the niqab or burka from receiving public services
 - Bans religious symbols in the public sector
 - Grounded in principle of laicite just like France
 - Passed June 2019
 - Bans teachers, police officers, judges and others from wearing items such as hijabs, turbans, kippas, and crucifixes in the course of their duties
 - Challenged in court by Muslim and civil libertygroups
 - April 2021: Court upheld Quebec province's ban on wearing religious symbols for public servants such as police and teachers
 - Quebec's Liberal government defended the law, saying it does not discriminate against Muslim women and is necessary for reasons of security, identification, and communication
	 - Balaclavas and other devices for concealing identities also prohibited

**Laws Supported by a Majority**:
 - France: Only 2000 women, from a total Muslim population of 4-6 million, wear the full-face veils
 - Fines for women wearing hijabs unlawfully: 150 Euros (216 dollars) + re-education classes
	 - Fathers, husbands, religious leaders who force women to wear face-veils fined 30k euros and a year in jail
 - Statistics from French Interior Ministry (2015): Even though the law was not always enforced, 1546 fines have been given out
 - In Quebec, only 3% of Canadian Muslim women wear the niqab (<100 women)
 - April 2010: Belgian Parliament also bans burqa and niqab (~30 women wear this in Belgium)

### The Hijab - A Political Symbol
 - Practice of head covering has been common in Jewish, Christian, and Hindu communities
 - Never attracted as much attention and controversy as the Muslim context
	 - Veil established as symbol of Muslim societies by colonial rulers of the Middle East
 - Egypt during the British Colonial Period: Hijab was controversial
	 - Lord Cromer, British Consul 19th c.: Advocated Muslim women's unveiling
		 - Saw as improvement of their lives (while fiercely opposing suffrage at home)
	 - Reza Pahlavi, 1936, Shah of Iran: Modernized Iran
		 - Encouraged women to discard hijab
		 - Afghanistan King Amanullah discouraged use in 1920s/30s
	 - Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini opposed the Shah's efforts to modernize and westernize Iran
		 - Led the Iranian Revolution (and hostage crisis) to form Islamic Republic of Iran
			 - In power in 1979, enforced use of hijab
 - Pahlavi dynasty was widely opposed, considered corrupt, politically repressive, lavish spending
 - Shah: Prohibited the hijab in a dictatorial and provocative manner
	 - Helped form connection between unveiling and authoritarian regime + colonial powers (US) that supported them
 - Hijab became a tool in the Iranian political arena
	 - Women's bodies became a key battleground between the dictator and his opponents
 - As a sign of civil protest, Iranian women adopted the hijab as a symbol of resistance against the monarchy
 - However once in power (1979), Khomeini instituted a number of laws including mandatory veiling and suspended family protection laws
	 - Women not veiled considered victims of *Westoxication* (Gharbzadegi)
 - Hijab in 1980s: Reignited by conservative Muslim scholars/leaders in Arab countries who advocated for limiting women's mobility and public visibility
 - Mernissi: Powerful male elites were threatened by women's presence and freedom
 - Anthropologist Fawa El Guindi: 1980s on, adoption of the hijab helped Egyptian women protect the opportunities that modernization had brought
	 - Such as access to education and ability to work outside the home
 - Served as a means to preserve their dignity and protect themselves against stereotypes that associated modernized women with negative moral judgements
	 - Modernized: Pursued education and careers
	 - Include accusations of being socially irresponsible or sexually promiscuous
 - Hijab became a lens through which external observers view Iran/MENA
 - Western media saw head-covering chador as proof that Iranian society consider women inferior
 - Iran: Those who objected portrayed simply as Iranian-style feminists who make similar demands to those of Western feminists
 - The anti-colonial aspect of their protests was erased
	 - Criticism of Western powers' involvement in Iran's oil industry
	 - This was inception of a new binary: Islam versus Feminism
 - Feminism as an ideological tool of the state: Paved the way for future justifications for war to liberate women from male oppression
 - Gender equality: American value that had to be introduced in a military way
 - September 11 attacks: Muslims collectively held responsible and punished for terror
 - Hijabi women were conspicuous targets
	 - Discrimination and racial profiling
 - War in Afghanistan: reframed as noble war to liberate Afghan women who had to wear burka
 - First Lady Laura Bush made this explicit in a radio address (November, 2001)
	 - "Fight against terrorism is also a fight for the rights and dignity of women"
 - Yet the Taliban's harsh reign became noteworthy to the West only after 9/11
 - 2004: French Hijab Ban: Compared niqab wearing to Taliban-enforced burka in Afghanistan
	 - Counterarguments presented by French Muslim women who insisted they wore the niqab by choice were largely ignored
 - The hijab has become controversial because they have been coopted into political symbols and exploited by geopolitical actors and movements
 - Thus, the "discourse of the veil" (arguable created by everyone but Muslim women) has largely overshadowed the insights that Muslim women themselves have made about it

### Religious Feminism and the Hijab
 - Muslim women are challenging negative associations with Islamic dress
 - "Modest fashion" a global movement spearheaded by religious women
	 - Selecting stylish fashion choices and prioritizing modest dress

**Religious Feminism in Islam**:
 - Re-readings of the Quran and dismantling of the non-gender egalitarian and misogynist constructions of Islam
	 - Afsaneh Najmabadeh and Ziba Mir-Hosseini
	 - Fatima Mernissi's analysis of hadiths
 - Islamic methodology of ijtihad to interpret Islam for the 21st century
	 - Itjtihad: Legal reasoning and interpretation of problems not precisely covered by the Quran
 - In Egypt, Suad Salih, dean and professor of commparative jurisprudence at Al-Azhar University argued that there is nothing in the religious texts preventing a woman from becoming a mullah
	 - Islamic theologian or clergy
