### Historical Interconnection of Religion and Health
 - Prior to the advent of modern medicine, healers in most societies were religious specialists
 - Concepts of health and illness were fundamentally religious or moral
 - Common cultural idea: Sickness was the result of sin or evil spirits

**History of Medical Anthropology**:
 - Before 1950s, study of illness and healing was done within cultural/social studies
	 - Ethnologies of far away societies and cultures
	 - How other people dealt with sickness
	 - Primarily focused on religion and medicine
 - Medical Anthropology developed in 1960s-70s
 - Early medical anthropologists had training in medicine
	 - W.H.R Rivers, Arthur Kleinman, Byron Good, etc
 - W.H.R Rivers and the Torres Strait expeditions:
	 - *Medicine, Magic, and Religion* (1927)
	 - Argued for long immersions in the field
	 - One of the earliest examples of using ethnography as method

### Medical Anthropology
 - Medical refers not to any one official class of medical system, but to any and all practices that are intended to address an affliction in need of attention
 - Medicine: The various curing and health-upholding practices found around the world
 - Medical anthropologists are interested in health, disease, illness, but also sickness & suffering
	 - Sickness, Suffering: Subjective, interest anthropologists whether or not a medical expert finds a physical source for the experience

**Biomedicine**:
 - Medicine of hospitals and mainstream doctors is referred to as biomedicine
 - Synonymous with Western medical concepts and practices
 - Views disease as having a unique physical cause within the body
	 - Microorganism causing infection
	 - Growth of malignant cells
	 - Failure of organ due to repeated insults (alcohol consumption)
 - Biomedicine is a specific medical tradition

**Ethnomedicine**:
 - The health-related beliefs, knowledge, and practices of a cultural group
 - All medical systems constitute ethnomedicines
	 - Developed from, and are embedded in particular sociocultural systems
	 - Regardless if they are small-scale or state societies
 - Biomedicine assumes that illness and medical theory (science and practice) are acultural and have universal validity
 - Term ethnomedicine was applied to other, nonwestern medical systems
	 - Referred to biomedicine as scientific, modern, cosmopolitan
	 - Or simply medicine due to ethnocentrism

**Medical Pluralism**:
 - Different approaches, treatments, and institutions to maintain health and treat illness
 - Most commonly, entails the combined use of biomedicine and nonbiomedical approaches
 - Ex. Cancer patients may complement chemotherapy with acupuncture and prayer
	 - Women trying to get pregnant combine hormonal treatments w/ home remedies & yoga

**Disease**:
 - Physiological or psychological dysfunction
	 - Biological process that doctors use to explain and understand illness
 - In Biomedical Paradigm: Disease indicates abnormalities or malfunctioning of the body, organs, systems, and can be materially detected
	 - Measureable, pathological
	 - Conception of disease is not exclusive to Western medicine
 - Constructed by practitioner/MD/healer when signs of illness are recast as in terms of the theory of a disease

**Illness**:
 - Subjective experience of feeling unwell, in individual's experience
 - Can include: Emergence of physical symptoms and experiences of changes
	 - Includes social concerns, identity, and negotiation

### Categorizations of Medical Systems
 - Foster and Anderson (1978): All medical systems have:
	 - Disease theory system: Ideas about nature of health, causes for disease and illness
		 - Personalistic Theory
		 - Naturalistic Theory
		 - Emotionalistic Theory
	 - Health Care System: Refers to social relationships and interactions between healers and patients
 - Allan Young's second model (1976) focuses on how medical systems organize knowledge
	 - Accumulating medical systems
	 - Diffusing medical systems

**Personalistic Theory**:
 - Views disease as resulting from actions of "sensate who may be supernatural being (deity/god), a nonhuman being (ghost, ancestor, evil spirit), or a human being (witch or sorcerer)"
 - The Black Plague (1347-1352): Cause unknown, attributed to supernatural forces, primarily the wrath of God
	 - People reacted with hopeful cures and responses based on religious belief, folklore, superstition, medical knowledge
	 - All were informed by Catholic Christianity in the West, Islam in the Near East

**The Black Plague - Religious Responses**
 - Christian View: Punishment from God for humanity's sins
	 - "Bad air", witchcraft and sorcery, individual life choices (lack of piety)
	 - Contagious and could be passed between people
	 - Could leave a plague-stricken region for one with better air, which was not infected
 - Christian Response: Could protect self through prayer, penitence, charms, amulets, mass, fasts
	 - Supposed cures and fumigation of "bad air" (plague doctor flower noses)
	 - Flight from infected areas
	 - Persecution of marginalized communities (Jews)
 - The Flagellant Movement: Group of zealous Christians, led by a master
	 - Roamed from town to city to countryside
	 - Whipping themselves for their sins and the sins of humanity
	 - Led communities in persecution and slaughter of minority groups 
 - Muslim View: Plague was merciful gift from God
	 - Provided martyrdom for the faithful, souls instantly transported to paradise
	 - Muslims should not enter, nor flee from plague-stricken regions, remain in place
	 - Not contagious because it came directly from God to specific individuals (God's will)
 - Muslim Response: Prayer, supplication at mosques, processions, mass funerals, oration, fasting
	 - Increased belief in supernatural visions, signs, and wonders
	 - Magic, amulets, charms used as cures
	 - Flight from infected areas
 - Jinns (Djinns, Genii): Spirits that are neither innately good nor evil
	 - Illnesses attributed to Jinns during black plague by some
	 - Gave rise to an increase in folk magic, use of amulets and charms to ward off evil spirits
	 - Charm or amulet would be inscribed with one of the divine names or epithets of God

**Naturalistic Theory**:
 - Views disease as emanating from the imbalance of certain inanimate elements in the body
	 - Such as male and female principles of Yin and Yang in Chinese medicine
 - Ex. Acupuncture

**Emotionalistic Theory**:
 - View disease as emanating from emotional experiences
 - *Susto*: Soul-flight, suffering from emotional trauma
	 - Chronic somatic suffering stemming from trauma
	 - Prayer and other healing rituals are a big part of treatment

**Accumulating Medical Systems**: Accumulated, formalized teachings, generally in written form
 - Shared with prospective practitioners in training institutions
 - Or with colleagues at conferences, professional associations

**Diffusing Medical Systems**: Practitioners generally do not share medical knowledge
 - Medical knowledge is diffuse or unsystematic
 - Regard it as a secret
 - Ex. Shamans and Healers, South African healers
