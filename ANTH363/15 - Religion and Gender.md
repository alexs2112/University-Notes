### Feminist Critiques of Religion
 - Feminists see society as patriarchal - based on male domination
 - Many feminists regard religion as also patriarchal that reflects and perpetuates this inequality

**Evidence of Religious Patriarchy**:
 - Organizations: Mainly male dominated
	 - Despite the fact that women often participate more than man in some organizations
	 - Example: Orthodox Judaism and Catholicism forbid women to become priests
		 - Women's exclusion from priesthood of most religions is evidence of marginalization
	 - Often separate the sexes and marginalize women
		 - Seating them behind screens while men occupy the central and sacred places
	 - Women's participation may be restricted
		 - Not being able to preach or read from the sacred texts
 - Taboos that regard menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth
	 - Seen as pollution, prevents participation
	 - Islam: Menstruating women are not allowed to touch the Quran
	 - Orthodox Judaism: Many menstrual taboos
	 - Sabarimala temple in Kerala has traditionally banned women and girls of "menstruating age" (10-50) from entering the place of worship
 - Sacred Texts: Largely feature the doings of male gods, prophets
	 - Usually written and interpreted by men
	 - Stories often reflect anti-female stereotypes
 - Religious laws and customs: These may give women fewer rights than men
	 - Access to divorce, how many spouses they may marry, decision making, dress codes, etc
 - Religious influences on cultural norms may also lead to unequal treatment
	 - Genital surgeries/mutilation, punishments for sexual transgressions (honour killings)
 - Many religions legitimate and regulate women's traditional domestic and reproductive role
	 - Catholic Church bans abortion and artificial contraception

**Historical Religious Patriarchy**:
 - Karen Armstrong (1993): Argues early religion often placed women at the center
	 - Earth mother goddesses, fertility cults, female priesthoods in Middle East until 6kya
	 - Seated Women of Catalhoyuk (7k BCE): Early female ruler/goddess in egalitarian culture
 - No single event or cause of change
	 - Patriarchy as a social system arose from combination of factors over different times
 - First clear signs of women being treated differently is in Mesopotamian archaeological record
	 - Women begin disappearing from public world of work around 5 kya
 - Codes and laws around gender begin to appear in Europe, Asia, Middle East
 - 4 kya, rise of monotheistic religions saw establishment of single, all-powerful male God
	 - Hebrew's Jehovah, male prophets like Abraham, 1st prophet of Judaism, Christianity, Islam
 - Shift from female-centric goddess worship to male-dominated religions
 - While religion is used to oppress women, not the direct cause of their subordination
	 - Result of patriarchal forms of society coming into existence in the last few thousand years
 - Once in existence, patriarchy began to influence and reshape religion
	 - Men reinterpreted beliefs in ways that favoured their dominance
	 - Religion now contributes to women's oppression
 - Religious beliefs function as a patriarchal ideology that legitimates female subordination
 - To understand gender in traditional Western Society, begin with the Judeo-Christian context

### Christianity and Gender
 - Mary Daly: Radical feminist and theologian (1928-2010)
	 - Radical views that religion was based on hostility and hatred towards women (misogyny)
 - Believed patriarchy was at the core of religion, created by men to exploit women
	 - Conditions them ideologically to accept this inequality as normal
 - Eg. Theology used to make women that choose abortions and use birth control to feel guilty
	 - Pressures women to submit to their husbands at home
	 - Make leadership out of the home, degrading them verbally, symbolically, personally
 - Argued that women need to abandon religion so they can find respect and liberation
 - Daly identified use of bible stories to portray women as bad
	 - Needing men to save them from their problems
	 - Adam and Eve: Adam is innocent and good protector of Eve, Eve tempted by devil
	 - In art, the serpent is frequently represented as female
 - Facilitated belief of Feminine Evil as myth which justified persecution of untrustworthy women
 - Story of Adam and Eve has communicated social and religious values to the West
 - Tertullian: Father of Latin Christianity and Founder of Western Theology
	 - Hates women and blames them for everything
	 - All women share the ignominy of Eve, all women are "the devil's gateway" who destroyed gods image of man
 - Ambrose: 4th-century bishop and doctor
	 - Refers to Eve as procreative helper for the purpose of generating human nature
	 - Concludes that this is why women is a good helper of less importance
 - Thomas Aquinas: Extended argument 13th century, claiming women were defective by nature
	 - Misbegotten males born female because of some defect
 - Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer Against Witches) draws heavily on Genesis 3
	 - Provided the Inquisition its principal theological justification for persecuting women
 - **Mary**: Catholic and Orthodox believers: Mary is the symbol of motherhood
	 - Immaculate conception, stays as a virgin

### Gender Ideologies, Biology and Culture
 - In 19th and mid 20th century, US gender ideologies were based on biological determinism
	 - Males and females were born fundamentally different
	 - Naturally attracted to one another
	 - Women's sex drive was less developed and reproductively oriented

**Emergence of Public vs Domestic Spheres**:
 - In large, stratified societies, men dominate public spheres while women are in domestic sphere
 - Doctrine of separate spheres reflected differences assumed to be natural
	 - Biological determinism
	 - Public sphere was the domain of men, able to freely move outside the home and participate easily in public life
	 - Private sphere was where women belonged, taking care of household matters
 - Emphasizes social separation between males and females, males control over females

**Cultural and Biological Origin Stories**:
 - Hunting way of life "molds man"
 - Starting in 1960s, popular hypothesis for male dominance focused on primate heritage
	 - Man, the Hunter
 - Stereotypes about differences between women and men arose from this creation story
	 - Connected to gender roles of 1950s
 - A legitimizing ideology
	 - Belief system developed by power to rationalize and perpetuate systems of inequality
 - Agnes Meyer: *Women Aren't Men* (1950)
	 - "Women have many careers, but only one vocation - Motherhood"
	 - "It is for women as mother, actual or vicarious, to restore security in our insecure world"

**Religious Feminism**:
 - Woodhead (2002) criticizes feminist explanations that simply equate religion with patriarchy and the oppression of women
 - While much traditional religion is patriarchal, this is not true of all religion
 - She argues there are "religious forms of feminism"
	 - Ways in which women use religion to gain freedom
 - Despite strong belief in traditional gender roles that such groups hold, women are able to use religion to increase their power and influence
 - Similarly, women make use of activities linked to church to share experiences and find support
	 - ex. Bible study groups
 - Note that position of women within some religions is changing
	 - Church of England: Permitted women's ordination into priesthood since 1992
		 - Fifth of all priests are now female
 - Woodhead also uses the hijab or veil worn by many Muslim women as an example
