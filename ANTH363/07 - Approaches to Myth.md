### Rationalist Approach
 - Myth interprets and explains natural events and forces
	 - Taking the myths at face value, people fully believed them as truth
 - Creation myths:
	 - How the universe was created
	 - How human beings were created
 - Levy-Bruhl - "The product of the pre-logical mind"
 - Tylor - "Faltering attempt by early humans to be scientific"
 - Frazer - "A primitive science"

**Trickster Myth**:
 - Napi Myth: Rationalist explanation would posit that the myth of the Big Rock is literal truth to believers
	 - Or a faltering attempt at being scientific
 - Myth: Napi and the Dogs
	 - Invited dogs into teepee to cook meat, had to make the fire bigger, teepee caught fire and dogs had to leave their tails behind, this is why they are always searching for their tails
 - A number of other tricksters appear in other cultures
	 - Br'er Rabbit: A central figure in oral tradition of African-Americans in the Southern US
	 - Loki: Norse trickster god
	 - Anansi: Central trickster figure in West African folklore
 - Trickster gods can be used to show pushing boundaries
	 - Either the repercussions of pushing those boundaries
	 - Or show how society has evolved to be at its current point

### Psychological Approach
 - Interprets myth as being symbolic with the symbolism rooted in human psychology
 - Myth expresses individual or collective phenomenon
 - The conflict between societal constraints and biological nature
 - Symbolic representations of these conflicts are universal
	 - Example: The trickster embodies contradictions, ambiguity, and the dual nature of human existence

**Sigmund Freud** (1856-1939):
 - Myths are irrational stories that represent unconscious wishes
	 - Predominantly sexual in nature (incest, homosexuality)
 - Our conscious mind censors these fantasies, desires, impulses, etc, because they are dangerous
 - Myths are our conscious minds way of dealing with these internal struggles
	 - Thus, deal with sexual hunger and guilt, etc
	 - Example: Oedipus Myth

**Carl Jung** (1875-1961):
 - Rejected most of Freud's sexual symbolism
 - Believed elementary ideas or "archetypes" were the building blocks of not only the unconscious mind, but of a collective unconscious
	 - Universal thoughts and modes of behaviour
	 - "Myths express character and stories that are encoded into the human species in prehistory, and therefore express universal concerns"
 - Myth stems from something beyond the individual subconscious
	 - The collective unconscious
 - Jung believed that everyone in the world is born with the same basic subconscious model of what a "hero"/"mentor"/"quest" is

**Archetypes - Jung**:
 - These are "primordial images" or archetypes
 - Provide the primordial elements in the myths and narrative constructions of widely different cultures
 - Archetypes: Recurring pattern of images, situations, or symbols found in the religion, mythology, art, and dreams of cultures around the world
	 - Events such as birth, death, marriage, and motifs such as the apocalypse and the deluge
	 - Figures such as the mother, father, child, the shadow, the wise old man, the maiden, the anima in man, the animus in woman, trickster, hero, orphan, seeker, destroyer, creator, sage, fool
	 - List is endless

**Phoenix Archetype**:
 - Mythical bird with colourful plumage that lives for 500-1000 years
	 - At the end of its life it builds a nest which catches fire and the phoenix is reduced to ashes
	 - A new, young phoenix then rises from the ashes
 - The phoenix's ability to be reborn from its own ashes has made it a symbol of rebirth, immortality, and renewal
 - Found in Arabian, Persian, Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Chinese, and Indian myth
	 - Christian resurrection
 - City of Phoenix, Arizona, built on the ruins of the Hohokam civilization

**Joseph Campbell and Heroes**
 - Influenced by Jung
 - Argued that all hero stories are fundamentally the same story
	 - The "Hero's Journey" or the "monomyth" (power of myth)

### Functionalist Approach
 - Durkheim: Role of myth is functional, myth reinforces social cohesion and unity
 - Myth is a social institution that orders rituals, economy, and history

**Malinowski** - "Myth in Primitive Psychology" (1926):
 - Myth is not an explanation of scientific interest, nor is it symbolic
 - Trobriand myths address psychological and social needs within a culture
 - Myth and social reality were functionally interrelated
 - Myth confirms, supports, and maintains the social structure
 - Satisfies "deep religious wants"
 - Myth expresses, enhances, and codifies belief
 - A moral compass for behaviour

**Trobriand Origin Myth**:
- The four main Trobriand clans emerged from a cave
- First clan to emerge is the highest ranking clan
	- The 4th, the lowest
	- Justifies ranks in society
- The highest ranked clan settled on the best ground, has rights to the land
	- Justifies rights to land
- Each clan also represented by a totemic animal (iguana, dog, pig, snake) which they are forbidden to eat
	- Legitimates food taboos
- Brother and sister emerged together as equals
	- Explains and validate incest taboos

**According to Malinowski, Myths**:
 - Help people navigate life's uncertainties
	 - Make sense of the world around them
	 - Address uncertainties and unpredictabilities of life
 - Provide a shared set of values, beliefs, and norms that contribute to cohesion & social order
	 - Reinforce a sense of identity and belonging
 - Gives validity to and explains certain ideas and principles
 - Offer models for behaviour, illustrate the consequences of deviating from expectations
 - Could address social problems and conflicts within a community

**Nyoro Myth** (Beattie 1960):
 - Nyoro Kingdom in present day Uganda
 - Nyoro king always had to belong to the Bito clan
 - Nyoro myths provide a mythical charter (explains and justifies) for the social and political order
 - First man of family Ki-ntu was created by god
	 - 3 sons all named Kana (little child)
	 - God agrees to give them separate names after they complete two tests
 - Outcome:
	 - Eldest son Ka-iru (little peasant) and his descendents will always be servant and cultivator
		 - Carry loads for his younger brothers and their descendants
	 - Second son named Ka-huma (little herder)
	 - Third and youngest son named Ka-kama (little mukama = little ruler)

**Charter Myths**:
 - Narratives or stories to help explain the origin
	 - Set up to authorize and validate current social customs and institutions
 - Foundational  to the identity and self-understanding of a community
	 - Serving as a kind of cultural charter or blueprint
 - Serve to legitimize the existence, practices, or authority of a group or institution
 - Nyoro myths provide a mythical charter for the social and political order
	 - Unequal allocation of authority
	 - Younger men get power
		 - Succession and inheritence by younger son is typical in Nyoro society
 - Japanese Charter Myth from Kojiki to justify rule of imperial Yamato line
	 - Oldest continuous hereditary monarchy in the world since 660 BCE
 - Roman Charter Myth of Remus and Romulus

### Structuralist Approach
 - Discarded overt functionalism
 - Maintained that myth provides the conceptual rather than normative supports of a social world
 - Emphasis on binary opposites
 - Synchronic (ahistorical) rather than diachronic (change over time) approach
	 - Myths are valid over all of time
 - Structural approach emerges from Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913) and his studies in linguistics

**Claude Levi-Strauss** (1908-2009):
 - Similar to Jung, was interested in better understanding the nature of collective phenomena
 - Myths have an invariant structure
	 - Consistent, underlying pattern not evident at the empirical level
 - Meaning of myths
	 - Not in their surface content
	 - But rather in their underlying structure
 - Elements of the myth = mythemes
	 - Like the elements of language
	 - Meaningless if taken in isolation
	 - Meaningful only in relation to other elements
 - Study of myth fundamentally the study of "thought"
 - Suggested that myths contained concealed messages with ideas of fundamental significance
	 - Must be decoded from oblique hints given in the narratives
 - Myths express philosophical and social conundrums and worries into puzzles that can be solved
 - Viewed the structures of myths as being common to the thinking of all people, regardless of culture
 - Studying the mythologies of Primitive people allows us to examine the unconscious universal patterning of human thought in its uncontaminated form
 - Primitive mythologies are closer to these universal principles than western beliefs
	 - Training we receive in Western society buries the logical structure under layers of culture interferences
 - Myths reveal natural, direct products of human imaginations and offer a window into how the human mind works and orders the world

**Binary Oppositions**:
 - Analyzed clusters of myths across many different places and cultures that are regarded as similar in theme
 - Relates particular oppositions to wider and universal ones
	 - Nature/culture; life/death; good/evil
 - Definition: Pair of related terms/concepts/ideas with contrasting meanings
 - Myths are organized around the conflict between these binary oppositions

**Harelips and Twins: The Splitting of a Myth**:
 - Twins feature in myths across North and South American indigenous cultures
 - In many traditions, twins personify opposites
	 - Often cast as two halves of the same whole
 - In certain part of Peru, in times of bitter cold: Priest called in all inhabitants who were known to have been born feet first, or who had a harelip, or who were twins
	 - Puzzle for Strauss: Why do indigenous communities in South and North America think hare, harelips, twins, and people born feet first are similar
	 - What is the association between these three
 - Twins were considered unnatural in many cultures, thought to have supernatural abilities
 - In the Salish myth, one of the sisters encounters a hare who hides under a log
	 - Sexual joke as sister steps over log
	 - Strikes the hare with her cane and splits its nose
 - When hit, the hare starts to split
	 - If this split did not stop at the nose but continued through the body, two individuals would have resulted
 - Reflects indigenous belief that twins result from an internal splitting of the body fluids which will later solidify and become the child
 - Kwakiutl (Vancouver Island): A cannibal ogress steals a small girl with a harelip in order to eat her
	 - She cuts her way out of the ogress's basket and falls to the ground feet first
	 - Symbolic equivalent to being born legs first
	 - Hare in Salish myth is situated on his feet, between the legs, symbolically equivalent
 - Using these myths: Breech birth = harelipped = hare = incipient twins = twins
	 - Hare is one of the highest deities in Ojibwa culture, embodies opposites
	 - Hares are natural species, not chosen because they are good to eat, but because they are good to think with
 - In some traditions, twins personify good and evil
	 - Twins have a dangerous birth, one will use cunning to be born first, risking the other twin's life and the mother's life
 - Peruvian priest was aware of association between cosmic disorder and latent power of twins
 - Twins and breech birth are splitting the mothers body
	 - Twins and babies of breech birth were often killed in tribes

**Summary**:
 - Cultural phenomena can be reduced to basic units of meaning
	 - These units of meaning are opposed like a code
 - Symbolism in the form of myths, stories, rituals, etc. express this code
 - "The purpose of myth is to provide a logical model capable of overcoming a contradiction"
 - This underlying structure of binary oppositions can be observed in all myths and the structures of myths is common to the thinking of all people

**Critiques**:
 - Structuralism is essentially synchronic and ahistorical
 - The binary oppositions may involve the imposition of Western dualistic concepts on the thought of preliterate people
 - Human practice and problem of meaning is totally excluded
### PostModernist Approach
- Reject universal explanations and grand theories as explanations of myth
- Rejects the idea of a singular, universal meaning inherent in myths
	- Instead, they emphasize the multiplicity of interpretations and meanings that can be derived from myths
- Interpretation is subjective, shaped by identity of the interpreter
- Emphasizes the importance of examining myths within their specific cultural, historical, and socio-political contexts, power dynamics, etc
	- What is the context in which it is told?
	- Who is telling the story, why and how?
	- What role do myths have in self definition and cultural identity?
	- What is the relationships of myths to politics, economics, art, etc.?
	- How and why do they emerge and change?
