### Rationalist Approach
 - Myth interprets and explains natural events and forces
	 - Taking the myths at face value, people fully believed them as truth
 - Creation myths:
	 - How the universe was created
	 - How human beings were created
 - Levy-Bruhl - "The product of the pre-logical mind"
 - Tylor - "Faltering attempt by early humans to be scientific"
 - Frazer - "A primitive science"

**Trickster Myth**:
 - Napi Myth: Rationalist explanation would posit that the myth of the Big Rock is literal truth to believers
	 - Or a faltering attempt at being scientific
 - Myth: Napi and the Dogs
	 - Invited dogs into teepee to cook meat, had to make the fire bigger, teepee caught fire and dogs had to leave their tails behind, this is why they are always searching for their tails
 - A number of other tricksters appear in other cultures
	 - Br'er Rabbit: A central figure in oral tradition of African-Americans in the Southern US
	 - Loki: Norse trickster god
	 - Anansi: Central trickster figure in West African folklore
 - Trickster gods can be used to show pushing boundaries
	 - Either the repercussions of pushing those boundaries
	 - Or show how society has evolved to be at its current point

### Psychological Approach
 - Interprets myth as being symbolic with the symbolism rooted in human psychology
 - Myth expresses individual or collective phenomenon
 - The conflict between societal constraints and biological nature
 - Symbolic representations of these conflicts are universal
	 - Example: The trickster embodies contradictions, ambiguity, and the dual nature of human existence

**Sigmund Freud** (1856-1939):
 - Myths are irrational stories that represent unconscious wishes
	 - Predominantly sexual in nature (incest, homosexuality)
 - Our conscious mind censors these fantasies, desires, impulses, etc, because they are dangerous
 - Myths are our conscious minds way of dealing with these internal struggles
	 - Thus, deal with sexual hunger and guilt, etc
	 - Example: Oedipus Myth

**Carl Jung** (1875-1961):
 - Rejected most of Freud's sexual symbolism
 - Believed elementary ideas or "archetypes" were the building blocks of not only the unconscious mind, but of a collective unconscious
	 - Universal thoughts and modes of behaviour
	 - "Myths express character and stories that are encoded into the human species in prehistory, and therefore express universal concerns"
 - Myth stems from something beyond the individual subconscious
	 - The collective unconscious
 - Jung believed that everyone in the world is born with the same basic subconscious model of what a "hero"/"mentor"/"quest" is

**Archetypes - Jung**:
 - These are "primordial images" or archetypes
 - Provide the primordial elements in the myths and narrative constructions of widely different cultures
 - Archetypes: Recurring pattern of images, situations, or symbols found in the religion, mythology, art, and dreams of cultures around the world
	 - Events such as birth, death, marriage, and motifs such as the apocalypse and the deluge
	 - Figures such as the mother, father, child, the shadow, the wise old man, the maiden, the anima in man, the animus in woman, trickster, hero, orphan, seeker, destroyer, creator, sage, fool
	 - List is endless

**Phoenix Archetype**:
 - Mythical bird with colourful plumage that lives for 500-1000 years
	 - At the end of its life it builds a nest which catches fire and the phoenix is reduced to ashes
	 - A new, young phoenix then rises from the ashes
 - The phoenix's ability to be reborn from its own ashes has made it a symbol of rebirth, immortality, and renewal
 - Found in Arabian, Persian, Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Chinese, and Indian myth
	 - Christian resurrection
 - City of Phoenix, Arizona, built on the ruins of the Hohokam civilization

**Joseph Campbell and Heroes**
 - Influenced by Jung
 - Argued that all hero stories are fundamentally the same story
	 - The "Hero's Journey" or the "monomyth" (power of myth)
