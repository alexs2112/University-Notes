 - Where does this idea come from?

### Witch Hunts in Early Modern Europe
 - Between 1450-1650, about 40k-60k people were executed by legal authorities for witchcraft
	 - Number up to 100k when counting deaths resulting from other related factors
	 - 75-90% of those accused were female
 - Witchcraft is heavily condemned in many places in the bible
	 - "Do not allow a sorceress to live"
 - **1300s**: Demonic witchcrat is not a concept yet
	 - Accusations of sorcery levelled at prominent political or religious leaders
	 - 1375: More courts adopt inquisitorial procedures
		 - Abolish penalties for false accusations
		 - Under inquisitorial system, judicial authorities could initiate investigations without a formal accusation from an aggrieved party
		 - Often used torture to extract confessions from the accused
 - **1400s**: First witch trials begin to appear as concept of diabolica/demonic witchcraft emerges
	 - Cases popping up in Switzerland, France, and the Holy Roman Empire
	 - Sporadic, not yet part of a widespread panic
 - Eventually witchcraft comes to be framed as an alliance between a person and the devil
	 - Threatens and undermines the Christian foundation of society

### Associating Witchcraft with the Devil
**Diabolic Witchcraft**: Witches were thought to engage in:
 - Performance of Maleficium - harmful magic
 - Diabolism - worship of the Devil
 - Theory emerged that witches had made pacts with the devil, or were worshipping the devil
 - Devil seducing witches by appearing at night
 - Devil put a distinctive mark on the witch's body, usually some kind of concealed spot

**The Papal Bull**: 1484
 - A public decree issued by Pope Innocent VIII in response to inquisitors Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger's request for authority to persecute witches
 - It acknowledged the existence of witches and explicitly empowers the inquisition to prosecute witches and sorcerers
 - Gave approval for the Inquisition to proceed with "correcting, imprisoning, punishing, and chastising" such persons "according to their deserts"

### Malleus Maleficarum
 - 1487
 - Inquisitor Heinrich Kramer publishes the most influential and widely used manual on witches, witch-hunting, and how to get confessions from accused witches
	 - Argues that witchcraft is a real and present danger, requiring severe punishment
 - The Gutenberg printing press had recently been invented
	 - Kramer fully utilized it to shepherd his work into print and spread his ideas
 - Kramer included the papal bull in the forefront of the book so it appears as though the Catholic Church sanctions it
 - Book remains in print today with introduction from the Roman Catholic Church
	 - No retractions from the original version
 - Full Title: *The Hammer of Witches which destroyeth Witches and their heresy as with a two-edged sword*
	 - Sprenger added as author a few decades later
 - To deny the existence of witches is to be a heretic, and burned at the stake
	 - Injected into the general Christian consciousness the belief that the existence of witches was a real and valid threat to the Christian world
 - Also highly misogynistic
	 - Women described as more prone than men to become devotees of Satan
	 - Engage in sacrificial infanticide, orgies, and sex with the devil

**Women and Witchcraft**:
 - Women's perceived promiscuity was harmful to men
	 - Bewitchment could result in impotence, or the disappearance of the penis itself
	 - Penis theft was capital offence
 - Many artists of the time took advantage of the artistic freedom that the subject provided to depict female nudity during a time of censorship

### 16-17th Century: Peak of Witch Trials
 - **Malleus Maleficarum** disseminated all over Europe to priests and magistrates
	 - Used to track down witches and try them in court
 - **Early 1500s to Late 1600s**: Witch hunts escalate across Europe Areas within the Holy Roman Empire, France, British Isles, and Scandinavia
	 - Significant number of trials and executions
 - **1542: The Witchcraft Act**: Passed in England
	 - Beginning of formal legal proceedings against witches in England
 - **1640s-1650s**: Witch trials reach their peak in regions like the Holy Roman Empire
	 - Famous cases such as Wurzburg and Bamberg with trials (hundreds of executions)
 - **1645-1647**: Witch-hunt craze hits England
	 - Matthew Hopkins, "Witchfinder General", responsible for the deaths of hundreds

**Witch Trials**:
 - Similar confessions from women were believed to be evidence of widespread Satanic worship
	 - Why did they confess?
	 - Why did the women's confessions all sound alike?
 - Various acts of torture were used against accused witches to coerce confessions, and cause them to provide names of alleged co-conspirators
	 - When torture was used to extract confessions, 95% of suspects were convicted
	 - When torture was not used, only 50% were convicted
 - It was thought that only through divine intervention could the witch feel the full pain of torture and thus be compelled to confess
	 - God commands an angel to prevent the Devil from aiding the witch
	 - The belief that only divine intervention could break a witch's resistance rationalized the use of such torture

**How to Spot a Witch**:
 - Foolproof method to establish if a suspect was a witch was ducking
 - Right thumb bound to left toe, the accused was thrown into a convenient pond
 - If the body floated it proved an association with the black arts
	 - The body rejects the baptismal water
 - If the victim drowned they were innocent
 - Given the position of the prisoner, it was more likely they would float

**The Witchfinder General**:
 - In England, torture was unlawful, but Matthew Hopkins used methods of torture such as sleep deprivation (*Tormentum Insomniae*)
	 - In once instance, John Lowe, 70-year old vicar of Brandeston, was swum in the moat, kept awake for three days and nights, and then forced to walk without rest until his feet were blistered
 - Swimming test: Tied to a chair and thrown into water
 - Cutting flesh with blunt knife: No blood = witch
 - Hopkins believed responsible for the deaths of 300 women between 1644-1646

**Discovery of Witches**:
 - Hopkins and his assistants looked for the Devil's mark
	 - Mark that all witches/sorcerers were thought to have
	 - Dead to all feeling and would not bleed
 - If no visible marks (such as moles, birthmarks, extra nipples) then invisible ones would be discovered by "pricking"
	 - Witch prickers employed to prick accused with knives or needles looking for such marks

### Executions and Witch Burnings
 - Once commonly believed that a witch's power could be nullified by destroying her blood in a fire, hence the practice of burning at the stake
	 - Sometimes uncooperative witches were burned with green wood, which took longer to kill them
 - The burning of a witch was usually a great public occasion
 - The execution took place shortly after the sentencing
 - The witch was often strangled first
	 - If the witch was not dead and managed to get out of the flames, onlookers shoved her back in
 - English witches were not burned at the stake in the popular continental manner
	 - Death at the stake was a fate reserved for traitors and heretics (Witchcraft Act, 1563)
	 - Approximately 1000 people were hanged for witchcraft in England
		 - Of these, 400 were hanged over a 14-month period by Matthew Hopkins

### Social Context
 - Black Plague (1346-1353) had wiped out half of Europe
	 - Severe labour shortages
	 - Economic instability
	 - Breakdown of existing social structures, feudalism -> diversified economy
 - From plague years, Europe had a well-developed tradition of persecution of outsider groups
	 - This includes "jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims, lepers, Romani"
	 - Blamed them for the crisis Little Ice Age
		 - Period of cooler temperatures
		 - Affected crop yields -> famine, poverty, social unrest
 - Economic hardships, social strain, conflicts over resources
	 - Theory that accusations were common in communities facing severe economic hardships
 - Political and religious unrest arising from Protestant Reformation

**Gender-Based/Feminist Theories**:
 - Highlight how accusations of witchcraft disproportionately targeted women
	 - Often reflect broader societal anxieties about female autonomy, sexuality, power
 - Possible factors:
	 - Increased need and desire to control nature
	 - Nature long identified as female
	 - Increased emphasis on male control within the family
 - Demographic Trends:
	 - Typically, a witch was old, poor, and isolated
	 - Mostly women, given fact they lived longer than men
	 - Proportion of unmarried women increased due to rising age of marriage due to poverty, closure of convents during Protestant Reformation
	 - Without the protection of male patronage
	 - Women who stood to inherit property (no brothers or sons) especially threatening
	 - Threatened to upset male control of property and social relations between sexes

**Functionalist Perspective**:
 - Functionalists argue that beliefs in witchcraft serve as social glue
	 - Binding societies together through common fear or respect
	 - It also provides an explanatory framework for misfortune and social tensions
 - Witchcraft accusations may have played a role in releasing social tensions
	 - Terminate personal relationships that have become undesirable to one party
 - Scapegoating theory: Proposing that marginalized individuals were targeted as witches during times of crisis or societal stress as a way to find a tangible source of blame for misfortunes
	 - Accusations of witchcraft could be used to eliminate rivals or settle personal vendettas

### End of Witch Hunts
 - Rise of scientific thought and skepticism challenges the belief in witchcraft
	 - Decline in magic coincided with increased control of environment
 - Changes in legal practices, including the requirement for better evidence and the decline of torture, lead to fewer convictions
 - Improved economic conditions and social stability reduced the need for scapegoats
	 - Better food supplies and conditions of health
	 - End of plague
	 - Better communications contributed to a better sense of security
	 - We have abandoned the idea of personal malice as a cause for misfortune
