### Myth
1. Something widely accepted but is really false
2. Stories that tell of heroic actions or "supernatural" events or forces of nature or gods and goddesses, usually sacred, and believed to be true by people who see religious or spiritual significance in them
3. "Primitive" belief about nature and the universe -> "Pre-Scientific"
 - This is not how we understand myth in anthropology and religious studies
	 - Scholarly use does not imply that the stories are true or false
	 - Thus we can speak of Christian, Islamic, Hindu, Jewish, etc. myths
 - Ancient narratives that attempt to answer enduring and fundamental questions
	 - How did the universe and world come to be?
	 - How did we come to be here? Who are we?
	 - What are our proper, necessary, or inescapable roles as we relate to one another and to the world at large?
	 - How should be behave? What are the consequences?

### Cosmology
 - What is the universe really like? How does humanity fit into the universe?
 - Kosmos = "universe" or "order" (opposite of chaos)
 - Cosmology deals with the order/structure of ultimate reality
	 - Cosmogony deals with the origin of that structure or order

**Christian Cosmology**:
 - Three-layered reality
	 - Heaven, Human world, Hell
 - Fictional cosmologies imitate this design (western European origins)
	 - Lord of the Rings

**Yanomamo Cosmology**:
 - Four layered reality
	 - Inverted dinner plates: Gently curved, round, thin, rigid, with a top and bottom surface
 - Empty Layer -> Yanomamo Souls (animals + dead ancestors) -> Earth -> Village of Spirit-Men
	 - Village of Spirit-Men: Almost barren, race of people not quite human, they rise up to the layer of the Earth to get eaten by the Yanomami

**Hindu (Vedic) Cosmology**
 - 14 worlds
 - The higher lokas (1-7) are described as the heavens
	 - Populated by higher gods
	 - Full of truth
 - The lower lokas (8-14) constitute the different "hells"
 - Trying to ascend past all of these worlds to become closest to god

**Sacred Geographies**:
 - Central points/lines that connect world to spiritual realms
	 - Known as *Axis-mundi*
 - Hindu Mythology: Tree of Life (usually a Banyan Tree)
 - Norse Mythology: Yggdrasil (Tree of Wisdom and the Tree of Life)
 - Greek Mythology: Mount Olympus
 - Hindu Mythology: Mount Meru (or Mount Kailash)

### Myths
 - Myths are repositories for cultural ideas about issues like cosmology and cosmogony
 - Other stories:
	 - Princess & the Frog: not a myth, doesn't explain anything in particular
	 - King Arthur & the Knights of the Round Table, Camelot, and Merlin: More of a legend, pseudo-documentation of historical events
 - Myths are considered:
	 - True sacred stories that occurred in the remote past
	 - Contain non-humans (gods, monsters) as the principal characters
	 - "Presents in the form of a narrative the basic *worldview* of a society"

**Worldview**:
 - The way in which societies perceive and interpret their reality
 - Provides an understanding of how their world works
 - Forms the template for thought and behaviour
 - Provides a basic understanding of the origin and nature of humans, and their relationship to the world around them

**Worldview - Psalm 8**:
1. Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory in the heavens.  
2. Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger.  
3. When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place
4. What is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?  
5. You have made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor  
6. You made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put everything under their feet:  
7. all flocks and herds, and the animals of the wild.  
8. The birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.  
9. Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
 - Serves to tell us the biblical worldview
 - Tells us the human relationship to this worldview and its component pieces

**Turtle Island - Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Creation Story**
 - Generations ago Sky Woman fell through a hole in the Sky World and tumbled downward toward the earth that was covered in water
 - As she fell, birds came to hold her and bring her gently to the earth
 - The Great Sea Turtle then rose from the seas and spread his legs outward
 - The animals came up from the ocean bringing mud from the ocean floor, placing it on the Great Sea Turtle
 - By the time Sky Woman landed on the Great Turtle's back, an island had formed... Turtle Island
 - From that island came North America and the world of the First Peoples of this land

**Trickster Myth - Napi**: (Variation)
 - One hot summer day, Napi, the supernatural trickster of the Niitsitapi (Blackfoot), rested on the rock because it was hot and he was tired
 - He spread his robe on the rock, telling the rock to keep the robe in return for letting Napi rest there
 - Suddenly, the weather changed and Napi became cold as the wind whistled and the rain fell
 - Napi asked the rock to return his robe, but the rock refused
 - Napi got mad and just took the clothing. As he strolled away, he heard a loud noise and turning, he saw the rock was rolling after him
 - Napi ran for his life. The deer, the bison, and the pronghorn were Napi's friends, and tried to stop the rock by running in front of it
 - The rock rolled over them. Napi's last chance was to call on the bats for help.
 - Fortunately, they did better, and by diving at the rock and colliding with it, one of them finally hit the rock just right and it broke into two pieces
 - This story explains why the rock is in two pieces, and also why bats have squashed looking faces
 - The myth warns against taking back what you have given away
