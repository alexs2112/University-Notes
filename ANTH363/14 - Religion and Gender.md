### Difference Between Sex and Gender
 - Sex refers to biological differences
 - Gender refers to cultural construction of male and female characteristics on a continuum
	 - "The ways members of the two sexes are perceived, evaluated, and expected to behave"

**Gender**:
 - A key organizing principle in society
 - Affects our choices, opportunities, worldview
 - Religion is where we find society's most "conservative" and "progressive" themes
	 - eg. gender fluidity
 - Gender generates powerful religious symbols organized by sex differences
 - Examples:
	 - Azande - Women have no access to divination practices
	 - Witchhunts - Women viewed as evil and sexual

### Religion, Myth, and Gender
 - Religious belief is most important aspect in shaping a particular view of gender
	 - Occupies a large place in all religions
	 - Religious language, rituals, roles, symbols, draw on this experience
	 - use it as a metaphor for division of separation
	 - Focus on difference

**Religion and Gender Intersect**:
 - Control over bodies: Abortion, contraception, FGM
 - Clothing: The clothes we wear or not (hijab)
 - Power: Gender relations
 - Economics: What work is appropriate depending on gender
 - Marriage: Polygamy, same sex
 - Gender Construction: Rites of passage
 - Ascetic Groups: Nuns, brotherhoods, monks
 - Concepts of Normalcy: homosexuality

**Religion, Myth, and Gender**:
 - Many texts, myth, and rituals articulate what men and women are like
	 - How men and women are supposed to relate
	 - Dictate appropriate conducts for genders
 - Value ascribed to each sex is not equal
 - Preoccupied with separating men & women (often Western interpretations)
	 - Many creation and divine myths feature androgynous, two-spirit, intersex, sex/gender changes, or binary figures in one body
	 - Examples: 
		 - Tiamat and Abzu (Mesopotamia)
		 - Ometeotl (Aztec)
		 - Lakapati (Phillipines)
		 - Wadj-wer (Egypt)
		 - Tresias, Dionysus, Hermaphroditus (Ancient Greece)
 - Can't understand gender experience, construction, and roles without religious context

### Hijras
 - 3rd Gender in India and Pakistan
	 - 2014: India Supreme Court verdict ruled hijras should be recognized as a separate third gender
 - Often undergo voluntary castration
 - Often identify themselves as transsexual, transgender, transvestite, homosexual, asexual, intersex, or eunuchs
	 - Many perform stereotypically feminine gender roles in how they dress, behave, and talk
	 - Might wear cosmetics, jewelry, and keep their hair long
 - Existed in the Indian subcontinent from the earliest Vedic period (2000 BCE) and throughout history of Hinduism
 - Viewed as the cultural descendants of the court eunuchs of the Islamic Mughal Empire (1526-1858)
 - Typically live together in a traditional commune arrangement of five or more *chelas* (disciples), supervised by a *guru* (teacher)
 - Still face extreme discrimination in health, housing, education, employment
	 - Under British rule: Hijras seen as a "breach of public decency" and incapable of "moral transformation"
	 - Laws enacted against hijras to fit British social standard of the time
 - Some hijras practice asceticism, others engage in sexual relationships with men or engage in sex work
 - By joining the hijra community, individuals are perceived as failing to fulfil conventional gender norms, such as marriage and bearing children
	 - Seen as deviant and suffer discrimination and marginalization
	 - Also seen as having the power to curse, to bless, and remove curses
 - See themselves as descendants of *Bahuchara Mata*

**Bahuchara Mata**:
 - Hindu goddess of chastity and fertility
 - Grants favours of male children
 - Patron goddesses of the Hijra community
 - Myth:
	 - Bahuchara Mata, daughter of a known warrior, was travelling with a caravan along with her sisters when a notorious bandit hijacked the caravan
	 - In their culture, dying at the hands of an enemy is an absolute no-no
		 - Would rather take their own lives
	 - Bahuchara decided it wasn't her, nor her sisters time to die
	 - Instead, she cut off her and her sisters breasts as a way to curse the bandit with impotence/make him a eunuch
	 - The only way for the bandit to have the curse removed was if he paid homage to Bahuchara  Mata by dressing and behaving like a woman
 - Cutting off her breasts secures her deification for her virtue and purity
 - In another variation, the thieves rape her and she curses them
	 - The thieves then realize she has turned them into hijras
 - In another version, Bahujara is a powerful man or prince. When threatened by thieves, he transforms himself into a women through his "spiritual power"
	 - The thieves try to rape her, in her defense she cuts off her breasts to no longer appear feminine
	 - She curses the thieves and they become hijras
 - One aspect of the stories is that Bahuchara's creation of hijras is seen as a curse
 - Some hijras believe their identity as a punishment curse 
	 - Explains low social status and derogatory treatment in society
 - Worshipped by many hijras, regardless of their individual religious identifications
	 - Particularly due to her association with transgender identity
 - Worshipped for her ability to give blessings associated with fertility to newlyweds and childless couples
 - Myths also have the theme of celibacy or impotence
	 - In particular, male celibacy achieved through removal of genitalia and gender transformation

**Hijra Myths**:
 - Two childless couples wanted a blessing from Bahuchara
 - Both had baby girls, when they grew up they loved one another and got married
	 - This angered the local king
 - King's animals' sexes changes by drinking from the lake
	 - He realized the power of the water, took one of the girls to the lake to drink, she became a boy
 - This lake became the well at Becharaji, said that many who enter the well come out as a *kinnar* (hijra)
	 - Their body changes, as does their face, voice, and sex

**Ardhanarishvara (Half-Female God)**:
 - Represents the synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe
 - Unity of opposites; beyond duality
 - In some myths, considered the source of creation

**Other Significant Myths**:
 - In the Ramayana, Rama, after witnessing their devotion to him, bestows upon hijras the ability to confer blessings when a son is born
 - In the Mahabaratha, Arguna (hero of the epic) is exiled and assumes the identity of a eunuch-transvestite for a year
	 - Performs rituals during weddings and childbirths that are now performed by hijras
 - Mahabaratha, Iravan sacrificed himself to goddess Kali to ensure victory for the heroes of the epic
	 - Before he dies, he wishes to marry
	 - Lord Krishna, in his female avatar (Mohini), marries him
	 - Hijras in South India considers themselves to be his descendent (Iravanis)

**Hijras Today**:
 - Many Hijras earn their living as beggars, prostitutes, and by dancing at carnivals, weddings, and births that require their blessing
 - Hijras are both feared for their ability to place curses, and pitied for being outcast children of Allah
 - Believed to hold great power because of their worship of the Hindu Mother Goddess (Mata Bahuchara)

**Myths and Gender**
 - These mythological narratives are essential for constructing hijras' sense of identity
 - Play a significant role in granting religious sanction
	 - Explains and legitimizes behavioural patterns, ritual practices, bodily forms of the hijras
	 - Also their role in society with their ability to curse and bless
 - References to third gender individuals in sacred texts produces a counter-discourse to the mainstream narratives, which portrays them as deviant subjects
 - Gains them a measure of respect for this identity and alleviates some of the stigma surrounding their identity
