### Bronislaw Malinowski
 - Critical of Durkheim's theory of religion
	 - The most deeply religious moments come in solitude, in detachment from the world
	 - Many strongly "effervescent" gatherings in tribal communities do not necessarily generate religious feelings
 - Accepted that public ritual had a social function
	 - Especially funerary rites
 - "Any theory of culture has to start from the organic need of man"
	 - Religion and magic serve human needs
 - Scientific attitude or science are universal
	 - No productive activities could be carried out without careful observation of natural processes and careful reasoning
	 - Considerable body of empirical knowledge
 - Religion and magic are also universal
	 - Superstition also in western societies

**Tobriand Islands**:
 - Did work on Trobriand Islands, much of his work started with yams
	 - Preconceived notions of other cultures (and racist)
	 - Seeing sophisticated yam storage structures and yam production was a surprise to him
	 - Yams need magic to make them grow properly. Magicians bless the herbs with magic axes
 - Success of agriculture depends on extensive knowledge of the soil, weather & seasons, and various cultivated plants
	 - Also depends on magic

**Malinowski's Functionalist Theory of Religion**:
 - Set out to prove that "savages" were rational, not the "living fossils" of a social evolutionary paradigm
 - Trobrianders hunted and gardened with empirically-honed skills
	 - Science
 - But they also used magic for almost everything
	 - How do the two coexist?
	 - When and why do they rely on magic?
 - Model focuses on how social institutions serve the biological and psychological needs of individuals
 - Clear distinction between religion, science, and magic
	 - Religion - Otherworldly, provides a feeling of peace and well-being
	 - Science - Concerned with control over the natural world
	 - Magic and science are complementary to each other, magic used where science is inadequate
 - Lagoon fishing: Men rely completely on their knowledge and skill, no magic required
 - Open-sea fishing: Fully of danger and uncertainty, require magical rites
 - Magic is not utilized when the ends can be achieved by ordinary means

**Death**:
 - Links religion to death and life-cycle rituals
 - Essence of religion:
	 - Idea of the spirit and the belief in immortality
	 - Both have a psychological origin
 - Humans are afraid of death, cannot face the idea of complete annihilation
 - Religion provides psychological safeguards
	 - "Religion saves man from a surrender to death and destruction"

### Sigmund Freud
**Psychological Explanations**:
 - Diagnosed religion as a "symptom" of neurosis
 - Freud introduced a psychological perspective to the study of religion
	 - Emphasized role of unconscious processes, emotions, and inner conflicts in shaping religious beliefs and practices
 - Proposed that religious beliefs involve the projection of universal unconscious desires, fears, and conflicts onto the spiritual realm

**Oedipus Complex**:
 - Religious beliefs are a manifestation of unresolved psychological conflicts stemming from the Oedipal period
 - Our tendency to envision a strong deity like God stems from the father figure in the Oedipus complex
	 - Child may feel a mix of love, fear, and rivalry toward their father
	 - Project these emotions onto the idea of a divine, all-powerful father figure later on
 - Oedipus complex involves guilt over the child's forbidden desires and fantasies
	 - Religion, in Freud's view, offers a framework for dealing with this guilt through rituals, moral codes, and the promise of redemption or forgiveness
 - Believed religion is an illusion and a collective neurosis to help us overcome inner psychological (sexual) trauma
	 - A form of wish fulfillment
 - Conflict between nature and civilization
	 - Nature of our society conflicts with our basic desires
	 - If Oedipus Complex were acted out, society would not be able to operate. Depends on structure and order
 - Freud proposes that religious beliefs provide rules or restrictions that keep the worst anti-social instincts, like the Oedipal complex, suppressed

**Critiques**:
 - No anthropoligcal evidence
	 - Malinowski: Trobriand Islanders have no evidence of Oedipal complex but have religion
 - A narrow selection of evidence
	 - Only looks at father figures in Christianity and Judaism, not universal
 - Evidence moulded to fit conclusions and his negative view of religion
 - Considered science to be "objective truth" and religion to be "illusion"

### Karl Marx
 - Religion is the "opium of the people"
 - Attempts to justify inequalities in power and status
 - Religion created an illusion of happiness that helped people cope with the economic difficulties of life under capitalism
 - Religion encourages ordinary people to orient themselves toward the afterlife
	 - They could expect to receive comfort and happiness
 - Obedience and conformity advocated by religious leaders as a means of reaching heaven
	 - Persuades people not to fight for better economic or social conditions in their current lives
 - Religion legitimizes inequality
	 - Example: Divine right of kings, religious oaths as elected official, etc

### Function of Religion
**Psychological Approach**:
 - Gives meaning to life (life after death)
 - A means for dealing with crises, death, illness, famine, flood, failure
	 - Reduces anxiety, provides comfort
 - Helps people cope with reality
 - Tells them how to behave
 - Removes burden of responsibility
 - Participation in religious ceremonies provides reassurance, security, ecstasy, closeness, etc

**Sociological Approach**:
 - Religion stems from society and provides for societal needs
