### Perceptions of Witchcraft
 - Dark and evil, or "new age"/earth-based goddess worship
	 - Both of these are primarily Eurocentric perspectives
	 - Grounded in European thought and belief
 - Practices we might define as witchcraft today have been performed for many thousands of years all over the world
	 - For most of human history, these practices were not seen or defined as witchcraft, but were simply the religious and spiritual practices of people

**Witchcraft in Non-European Cultures**:
 - Western societies: 
	 - Especially during the Middle Ages and Early Modern period, seen as a harmful practice
	 - Accusations of witchcraft led to widespread witch trials and executions
 - African societies:
	 - Considered real and inherently malevolent
	 - Often blamed for misfortunes and calamities
 - Asian societies:
	 - Integrated into the broader spiritual framework, not always malevolent
	 - Example: Japanese Onmyodo can be considered witchcraft that was accepted and used by the state in the Heian Period

### The Azande
**EE Evans-Pritchard and the Study of Azande Witchcraft**:
 - Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard (1902-1973) was a British anthropologist
 - Provides detailed account of the Azande's belief system and practices related to witchcraft

**The Azande**:
 - Residing in regions now known as South Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic
 - Savanah forest
 - Horticulturalists, but also hunt and fish
 - Live in relatively small villages linked through identification with larger areas presided over by princes within what was once a larger kingdom prior to the colonial period
 - Have a complex belief system centered around witchcraft
	 - They see as a natural part of everyday life

**Granary Accidents**:
 - Azande granaries are built on wooden stilts to protect food and supplies from animals
 - Under granaries, served as communal spaces for sharing news and socializing
 - Termites often weaken stilts, leading to collapses that can injure or kill people underneath
 - Azande attribute such accidents to witchcraft
 - EP tried to explain that it was termites causing the tragedy
	 - They acknowledged the natural causes, but seek deeper explanations for misfortune

**Azande Beliefs**:
 - Views misfortune and suffering as influenced by witchcraft
	 - Reflecting complex worldview that integrates natural and supernatural explanations
 - Believe that some persons in their villages are witches and can injure other people psychically
	 - Not by ritual, no such thing for them
 - EP highlighted the rationality within Azande thought
	 - Understanding of natural causes while probing into why misfortune occurs to certain individuals at specific times

**Azande Witchcraft**:
 - The belief in witchcraft is present in every aspect of Azande society
 - They believe it is a power that can only be passed on from a parent to their child
 - A witch uses witchcraft when he has hatred towards another person
	 - Can manipulate nature to bring harm upon the victim of the witch
 - Oracles and witch doctors determine if someone is guilty of using witchcraft on another villager
 - More magic is then created to avenge victim, punish the one who committed the transgression

**Oracles**:
 - Victims use divination rituals to uncover identity of the witch responsible for their misfortune
	 - First the accused are brought to the judge, if there is no conclusion they go to an oracle
 - Oracles play a critical role as a means of uncovering truth and making decisions
	 - Most significant oracle is "Benge" oracle, Uses of poison to determine guilt or innocence
	 - Also termite DIY oracle, see if the termites eat one stick or the other
	 - Rubbing stick oracle, rub two certain sticks together and then see if they will slide to answer a yes or no question

**Azande Witchcraft**:
 - Evans-Pritchard defines witchcraft as the innate, inherited ability to cause misfortune or death
 - Witchcraft involves unconscious psychic powers emanating from a black swelling, located near the liver
 - Witchcraft or mangu exists within the body of an individual
	 - Passed down from parent to child of the same sex
 - Important to the Azande is whether or not a person is intentionally directing their mangu to harm someone else
 - Mangu is blamed when an unexpected calamity occurs
	 - The afflicted person must be the object of a witch's hatred/jealousy/etc in some way

**Accusation and Resolution**:
 - After identification, the political head sends a deputy to confront the accused witch
 - Accused witches typically agree to stop the bewitchment upon confrontation
 - If the victim's health improves, the issue is considered resolved with no reprisals against the accused
 - Continued misfortune leads to further divination to discover deceit or identify a new witch
 - Witches are never strangers or those in a superior social position
 - Suspects are not chosen randomly but from among social rivals, political competitors, or known enemies

**Azande Witchcraft - Key Points**:
 - Evans-Pritchard's work on the Azande challenged prevailing notions of "primitive" religion and magic, showing them as rational systems of thought that serve complex social and psychological functions
 - The Azande approach to resolving witchcraft accusations underscores the role of social structures and relationships in interpreting and addressing misfortunes
 - Witchcraft = a formalized method of conflict resolution and a mechanism for social control
	 - Maintains social harmony by attributing personal misfortune or social grievances to supernatural causes rather than to individuals
 - Witchcraft belief also strengthens community bonds
	 - Individuals come together to protect against or resolve witchcraft accusations

### Perspectives on Witchcraft
 - Cultural anthropologists analyze witchcraft from various perspectives

**Functionalist Perspective**:
 - Functionalists argue that beliefs in witchcraft serve as a social glue
 - Bind societies together through common fear or respect
 - It also provides an explanatory framework for misfortune and social tensions

**Structuralist Perspective**:
- Structuralists, like Claude Levi-Strauss, suggest that witchcraft is a part of the broader belief systems that form the structures of societies (kinships, politics, economy, power, etc)
- It's an integral part of the mental processes that create cultural meanings

**Symbolic Perspective**:
 - Symbolic anthropologists interpret witchcraft as a symbolic language representing deeper societal issues, such as power dynamics, gender roles, and social inequalities
