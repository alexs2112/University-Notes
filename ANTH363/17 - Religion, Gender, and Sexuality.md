### The Madonna/Whore Dichotomy (MWD)
 - Madonnas: Viewed as pure, saintly, and worthy of respect, often associated with qualities of motherhood, chastity, and nurturing
 - Whores: Sexually liberal, desirable but not respectable, often objectified
 - Madonna of Humility with the Temptation of Eve (Olivuccio di Ciccarello, 1400)
	 - Virgin Mary represents chastity and purity, holds infant Jesus
	 - Eve lies naked with serpent and fur around hips and legs, represents sexual lust and temptation

**Madonna/Whore Complex**:
 - Psychological concept/cultural idea that split women into two mutually exclusive categories
 - First identified by Sigmund Freud, reflects a split perception of women in the male psyche
	 - Natural split in men's minds, mothers/sisters=Madonna, attractive women=whore

**Binary Opposition**:
 - Can be traced to ancient Greeks to later Western literature
	 - As well as contemporary films and television series
 - Still prevalent in the West
	 - Also occurs in non-western cultures, where female chastity is integral to family honour

### MWD According to Feminist Theory
 - Viewed as an ideology designed to reinforce patriarchy
	 - Polarized views that women fit into one of two mutually exclusive types
	 - Associates sexual women with negative traits, and chaste women with positive traits
 - Feminist scholars argue that MWD reinforces unequal gender roles
	 - Limits women's self-expression, agency, and freedom by defining their sexual identities as fitting one of two rigid social scripts
 - MWD meshes conventional scripts that men should act as sexual initiators and women as careful gatekeepers, limiting women's sexual agency
	 - Pressures women to follow chaste path, or seen as unsuitable wives and mothers
 - Welles (2005) found women's concerns about getting a bad sexual reputation predicted shame about their sexual desires
	 - Risking perceived morality and men's protection 
 - Tolman and Tolman 2009: Shame about sexual desires reduces women's sexual agency and puts women's mental, physical, and sexual health at risk
 - Assertive female sexuality is seen as a threat and punished

### Sexuality in the West
 - Saint Augustine: Nothing is so much to be shunned as sex relations
 - Many religious sexual prohibitions had more to do with historical political and economic factors
	 - Versus direct interpretations of religious texts
	 - Paul the Apostle: Associated spirituality with celibacy
		 - Emphasized overcoming "desires of the flesh"
	 - Saint Augustine: Lust was original sin of Adam and Eve
		 - Intercourse within marriage for procreation was only acceptable form of sexuality
 - Control of people's sex lives concentrated power in the hands of the church
 - Economic issues: Controlling women's sexuality assured that inheritance went to biological heirs
	 - Increased value of virginity
	 - Sex for any reason other than procreation within marriage in sinful
	 - Etc.

**Judeo-Christian Cultural Legacies**:
 - Sex is sinful
	 - Since sex was only for conceiving children, sexual pleasure was sinful, sends you to hell
	 - Sex for Procreation: Reproduction is the only legitimate and moral reason for sex
	 - Rigid Gender Role Legacy: Creates different expectations for males and females
 - Eve vs Mary: Two contradictory roles for women
	 - Eve: Evil temptress
	 - Mary: A virgin mother
	 - Increasing emphasis on Eve's sin fostered antagonism toward women
		 - Climaxed in witch hunts (1450-1700)
 - Madonna/Whore Dichotomy
	 - The idea that women can either be maternal/nurturing or sexual, but not birth

### Changing Attitudes
 - Protestant Reformation
 - Enlightenment; Scientific Rationalism
	 - Temporary increase in respect for women
	 - Value of sex in marriage, functions beyond procreation
 - The Victorian Era (1800s)
	 - Rigid gender roles; women restrained and constrained
	 - Emotional & Physical distance between husband and wife
	 - Sexual repression in the home while prostitution flourished
 - The 20th century:
	 - Suffrage movement, WWII, work
 - Expanding, less restrictive gender roles
	 - 1960s: "Sexual Revolution" and movement for gender equality
	 - Increase access to information about sex, birth control, etc
	 - Women's sexuality began to be researched and better understood
 - Traditionally, unmarried Catholics express chastity through sexual abstinence
	 - Sexual intercourse within marriage is considered chaste when it retains the twofold significance of union and procreation
	 - A Pew Research poll conducted in March 2013 (Pope Francis) found 3/4s of US Catholics say that the church should permit birth control

### Sexuality in Islam
 - In scripture, sex in marriage only
	 - Sexual urges should not be repressed, but fulfilled for both sexes in a responsible manner
 - Some interpretation of scripture assert that women are inherently more sexual than men
	 - This power contained by veils, segregation, female circumcision
 - According to some scholars, oppression of women and many sexually related restrictions stem from patriarchal cultural traditions and fundamentalist sects
	 - Not from religion and the teaching of the Quran

**Hoejabi**:
 - Before a certain age, Muslim women are presumed to be virgins
 - After a certain age, wives
 - Rob the individual Muslim woman of any agency, there is no middle ground
 - Hoejabi bridges between virgins and wives

### Lilith
 - Mythological female demon from Sumer, about 6000 years BP
 - Thought to bring illness, disease, and death on the wind
 - She is mentioned in the Bible once (Isaiah 34:14)
 - In Jewish mythology, she appears as a night demon
 - The best known tale of Lilith originates in a medieval work called "The Alphabet of Ben-Sira"

**The Dark Feminine**:
 - According to Jung, Lilith was a "shamanistic anima"
 - She challenges the individual (regardless of gender) to acknowledge and respect the complexity and autonomy of the feminine
	 - Both within and without themselves
 - For many feminists, Jewish women, and neopagans, Lilith is a symbol of female independence and autonomy, both sexually and in other aspects of life
 - Lilith bows down to no man or god, not even God himself
 - She is the goddess of female sexuality for pleasure itself, and not merely for reproduction

### Conclusion
 - Hijab is not merely oppressive or liberatory, instead its significance and impact vary widely depending on the context
 - Muslim and Christian women and feminists are redefining feminism and religion within their cultural and religious contexts
	 - Challenging both local patriarchal structures and common misconceptions
 - Societal norms and gender stereotypes continue to shape perceptions of women's roles and behaviours in contemporary society
