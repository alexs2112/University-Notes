### Change in Religion
 - Two most basic change processes:
	 - *Innovation*: An individual or group within society invents/discovers some new idea, object, or practice

 - These take the form of:
	 - Addition, Deletion
	 - Reinterpretation
	 - Elaboration, Simplification
	 - Purification
	 - Schism/Fission
	 - Abandonment
	 - Extinction
	 - Syncretism
