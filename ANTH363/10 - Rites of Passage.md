### Rites of Passage
 - Throughout our lives there are periods where not much seems to happen
 - Then there are times when our lives undergo dramatic change
	 - After which nothing is quite the same as before
 - These transitions are often marked by rituals
 - What is a Rite of Passage?
	 - Rituals that serve as mileposts or landmarks that guide travelers through the life cycle
 - Graduation, Weddings, Funerals, etc

**Rituals**:
 - Rites of Passage (Van Gennep, 1909): A ceremony designed to transition individuals between life stages
 - Stages of Passage: Separation, liminality, reincorporation
	 - The three stages of a rite of passage take an individual on a journey from separation, through transition, to the final stage of reincorporation and acceptance

**Separation or Preliminal Phase**:
 - Individuals are removed from their current social identity and begin preparations to enter the next stage of life
 - Symbolic death of the old state
 - Removal from society
 - Rituals symbolize cutting or separating (eg. removal of hair)
 - Seclusion
 - Xhosa communities, South Africa – boys traditionally transitioned to manhood through each ritual stage. In separation stage, the boys leave their homes and are circumcised; they cannot express distress or signs of pain during the procedure

**Transition or Liminal Phase**:
 - The liminal period that follows is a time in which individuals often undergo tests, trials, or activities designed to prepare them for their new social roles
 - Person is in between states
 - Symbolically placed outside society
 - Observes certain taboos or restrictions
 - Following circumcision, Xhosa boys live in isolation, let wounds heal, don’t talk to anyone except other boys also undergoing rites of passage. Before they return home, living quarters are burned to the ground symbolizing loss of childhood.

**Liminal Period**:
 - Initiate separated from normal life and secluded is in an ambiguous condition
 - Initiate has nothing, sacred poverty state
	 - No status, property rank, or kinship position
 - Initiates may be seen as sexless or bisexual, or considered unclean or polluting
 - Treated as an embryo or a newborn infant, or thought of as "dead" (by and to his parents and community)
 - A suspension of normal obligations
 - Stress on servility to absolute authority of the ritual elders
 - Secret, esoteric knowledge (the sacra)
 - Betwixt and between
	 - Structurally dead
 - Ordeals and humiliations represent the partial destruction of the previous state
	 - Also prepare them to cope with the new rights and responsibilities
 - The initiate is reshaped or molded physically and psychologically so that society's values can be inscribed on his or her body or mind
 - Monks can be thought of as existing in a permanent liminal state
	 - A nation at war can also be thought of as being in a liminal state
	 - Also university students

**Communitas**:
 - Unstructured and egalitarian bonds between people
 - Typical of the liminal stage of a rite of passage
 - A communal bond that results from social levelling and shared experience of liminality
 - Among initiates there is often complete equality
 - Comradeship transcends distinctions of rank, age, kinship position
 - Communitas transgresses or dissolves norms that govern institutionalized relationships
 - Communitas emerges where structure is not
 - Communitas has an aspect of potentiality

**Incorporation - Postliminal Phase**:
 - In the final stage of incorporation, individuals return to the community with a new socially recognized status
	 - Symbolically reborn
 - Completes transition to a new status
	 - Lifting of restrictions
	 - Wear new clothes and insignia
 - When Xhosa boys return to their community, the incorporation phase, they are recognized as men and allowed to learn the secret stories of the community

### Rituals and Symbolism
**Ndembu:
 - The significance of the milk tree
 - The significance of colour - White and Red
 - Ritual circumcision: "The life of an adult male, who as a hunter and warrior has to shed blood"

**Xhosa**:
 - Circumsision and specific garments and colours of clay (white and red)
 - Similar to Ndembu rituals, Xhosa ritual symbols demonstrate multivocality
	 - A single symbol can stand for many things
 - The pain and endurance involved in circumsision and seclusion symbolize not only personal strength and bravery but also the complex societal expectations placed on Xhosa men

## Turner's Ideas in *Betwixt and Between*
 - Basic model of society is a structure of Positions
 - Rites of passage are seen as a movement from structure to anti-structure, back to structure
 - The period of margin or "liminality" is an interstructural situation
 - This then becomes an important period in which to understand social structure or organization
 - Liminal stage Turner believes is where the building blocks of society are exposed and open for comparison

### Pilgrimage
 - Pilgrimage represents a rite of passage
 - An inherent aspect of pilgrimage is movement, both in the sense of moving out of one's everyday space and of moving to and through the pilgrimage space
	 - A space/path that is well marked by ancestors/spirits who came before
 - Exiting the mundane state and crossing a threshold into a different place and a different time
	 - Into liminality
 - Turner: A pilgrim's commitment is to full physicality to being there.
	 - Pilgrim thus "becomes himself a total symbol" who enacts and embodies the message and power of the place and its history
