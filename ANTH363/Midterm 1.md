### History of Religion
 - *Religio*: Originally refers to fear or reverence for gods
 - Bavarian Grave: 27 skulls embedded in red ochre, second group of 6, 20 were children, 9 women
 - Cro-Magnons: Fertility idols, red ochre as mummification
 - Neolithic: Mother Goddess transforming to creation & regeneration, protecting vegetation, agriculture
 - Axial Age: Broad changes, parallel development in religious and philosophical thought
	 - Pyramid Texts: Oldest known religious texts. Invention of writing and wheel
 - Greece: Original study of religion. Herodotus, Epicurus, Stoics
 - Rome: Also studied religion. Cicero, Seneca, Tacitus, Caesar
 - Europe: Moveable type printing press (1450), monumental impact on culture, Gutenberg Bible was earliest major book printed and mass produced
 - Atlantic World: Dominated by Europe, spreading Christianity was an integral goal
 - Protestant Reformation: Martin Luther's opposition to Catholicism, several protestant denominations
 - Westphalia Peace Accord: Culmination of reform, ended Holy Roman Empire, feudal -> nation states
 - European Age of Scientific Discovery: Two phases
	 - First phase: Empiricism, mechanical + chemical philosophy, mathematization of the world
	 - Second phases: Empirical + mechanistic analysis to human personality and  cultures
 - European Enlightenment: Self-rule replaces divine right of kings, humanistic ideas, science != religion
 - Deism: Natural religion, observation of natural world is sufficient to determine divine creator, natural rules, supposedly religion of very first humans
 - Charles Darwin: Biological studies of evolution -> knowledge to support social, econ, political studies
 - Social Evolution: Herbert Spencer, Survival of the fittest, evolutionary scale of primitive to civilized
 - Scientific Racism: Evolutionary hierarchy, Young Chimpanzee -> Black Person -> White Person

**E.B. Tylor**:
 - Social evolutionist, asserted development of religions between "stages" is universal in culture
 - Ancient savage philosophers were concerned with: Difference between life and death, sleep, dreams
	 - Explanation: Spirit or soul in dreams and waking hallucinations to animate lifeless objects
 - Animism: Belief in spiritual beings, primitive man was a rationalist and scientific philosopher
 - Evolutionary Schema: Animism -> Polytheism -> Monotheism
	 - Shift in morality, selfishness -> altruism
	 - Continuance doctrine of life after death replaced by retribution doctrine
 - Critiques: Lots of archaic peoples had monotheistic religions

**Robert Marett**
 - Animism was not the most basic, origin of religion found in presence of impersonal supernatural force
	 - Present everywhere and in specific people/objects (Orenda in Iroquois, Mana in Melanesia)
 - Simpler, pre-animism

**Sir James Frazer**:
 - Golden Bough: Sacred groves for priests/kings, pluck golden bough -> single combat for control
 - Many myths revolved around a god or king who undergoes sacrificial death
 - Dying and resurrecting associated with vegetation symbolism, cycles of nature
 - Sympathetic Magic: Like-produces-like, voodoo dolls, imitative magic
 - Contagious Magic: Things once conjoined and then separated can still influence each other (hair, teeth, nails, clothes, etc)
	 - Tooth knocking-out ceremony of Aranda Tribe
 - Evolutionary Model: Magic -> Religion -> Science

### Durkheim - Functionalism, Totemism
 - Functionalism: What is the function of religion? What does it do for people and social groups?
 - Atheist, thought there had to be some need for religion (not just based on religion)
 - Irreducible dichotomy between the sacred and the profane

**The Profane**:
 - Outside the temple, ordinary everyday aspects of life that are not imbued with religious significance
 - Could damage or pollute the sacred by contact

**The Sacred**:
 - Extraordinary aspects of life, special significance or holiness, set apart from profane (taboos)
 - Non-utilitarian, non-empirical, social group more powerful than the individual

**Totemism**:
 - Derived from Ojubwa word *ototeman*: Ones brother-sister kin. Sacred object (especially animal)
 - Division of labour in totemic societies is not highly stratified -> simple societies
	 - Durkheim assumes Totemism is most basic form of religion
 - Claims Totemism is not really about the totem, but about the clan itself (personification of clan)

**Durkheim's Definition of Religion**:
 - Religion can be divided into 2 parts, the union of beliefs and rituals
	 - Beliefs are collective representations of the group's shared values and conscioence
	 - Rituals are structured framework for maintaining social order and solidarity
 - Religion must exclude magic, as magic is:
	 - Individualistic(selfish), Instrumental (means to an end), Imminent (immediate outcomes)
 - Where religion is:
	 - Collective (communal), Unifying (maintain social cohesion), Transcendent (intangible realities)

**Criticism**: Too rigid separation between sacred and profane
 - Many groups lack kin-groups and totems but have religion
 - Religious beliefs may have ideological function (legitimating domination of groups over others)

### Bronislaw Malinowski - Functionalism, Trobrianders
 - Critic of Durkheim, most deeply religious moments come in solitude
 - Tobriand Islands: Racist guy, sophisticated yam storage structure surprised him
 - Wanted to prove savages were rational
 - Trobrianders hunted and gardened with science but also used magic for everything
 - Functionalist Model on how social institutions serve needs of individuals
 - Distinction between religion, science, magic. Magic used where science is inadequate, complementary
	 - Lagoon fishing: pure skill, no magic. Open-sea fishing: dangerous and uncertain, need magic
 - Links religion to death and life-cycle rituals, religion provides psychological safeguards from death

### Sigmund Freud - Functionalism, Psychological Explanations
 - Religion as symptom of neurosis, emphasized role of unconscious process shaping religion
 - Oedipus complex: Tendency to envision strong deity like god comes from father figure
	 - Fear, love, rivalry toward father, project these into all-powerful divine father figure
 - Guilt over child's forbidden desires, religion offers framework for dealing with this via ritual
	 - Form of wish fulfillment, collective neurosis to overcome inner psychological trauma
 - Critiques: No anthropological evidence, considered science to be object truth, religion to be illusion

### Karl Marx - Functionalism,  Opium
 - Religion is the opium of the people, encourages people to orient themselves towards the afterlife
 - Religion legitimizes inequality (divine right of kings, religious oaths)
 - Obedience and conformity advocated by religion as a means of reaching heaven

### Clifford Geertz - Interpretive Anthropology
 - Focuses on meanings & symbols as it relates to native perspective, gives meaning to human existence
 - Religion is system of symbols, establishes long lasting motivations, many meanings of a symbol
	 - Object, gesture, sound, image that stands for some other idea, concept, or object
 - Leslie White: Essence of culture is process of bestowing meaning upon a symbol (holy water)
 - Religion provides meaning by offering ethical criteria to guide human behaviour, moral landscape
	 - Linked to what Geertz calls "the problem of meaning"
	 - Challenge deciphering symbolic structures to understand significance ascribed to them
 - Anthropological study of religion is a two-stage operation
	 - Analysis of system of meanings embodied in religious symbolism
	 - Relating of systems to social-structure and psychological processes

### Mary Douglas - Purity and Danger
 - Beliefs are logical and symbolic efforts to impose order on the world through contrasting categories
 - Main dichotomy: Clean and unclean. Symbolism of cultural categories related to purity and impurity
 - Symbols become powerful tools to reinforce cultural values regarding cleanliness and order
	 - Religious mandates that specify what is pure and permitted vs what pollutes and is taboo
 - Human body: Excretes unclean material (shame), connected to unclean aspect of life (death, corpse)
	 - India: Caste system from Vedic myth of Purusha's cosmic body. Hierarchy of body parts from the head down to the feet and floor
	 - Human body becomes symbolic expression for ordering society

### Victor Turner - Liminality
 - Referential symbols used in ordinary speech to have relationship with concrete items or fact
	 - Rituals often involve symbolic actions to convey deeper meanings
 - Liminality: Concept referring to transitional phases within rituals and social processes
	 - Suspension of normal social roles, structures. Symbolism is crucial, transformation of states
	 - Example: Graduation ceremonies
 - Communitas: State of unstructured & egalitarian community that arises during liminal periods
	 - Symbolism helps create shared sense of identity and belonging
	 - Ritual symbols, gestures, objects become expressions of collective experience & solidarity

### Cosmology and Myth
 - Myth in anthropology and religious studies:
	 - No implication that the stories are true or false
	 - Ancient narratives that attempt to answer enduring and fundamental questions

**Cosmology**:
 - Dealing with the order & structure of ultimate reality (cosmogony deals with origin of reality)
 - Christian: Three-layered reality (Heaven, Human World, Hell). Fictional cosmologies imitate this
 - Yanomamo: Four-layered reality of inverted dinner plates
	 - Empty Layer -> Yanomamo Souls (animals + dead ancestors) -> Earth -> Village of Spirit-Men
	 - Village of Spirit-Men: Barren, race of almost humans,  rise up to Earth to get eaten by Yanomami
 - Hindu (Vedic): 14 worlds, higher Iokas (1-7) are described as heavens (higher gods, truth). Lower lokas (8-14) constitute different hells. Try to ascend past all of them to become closes to god
 - Sacred Geographies: Central points that connect world to spiritual realms (Axis-mundi)
	 - Examples: Tree of Life, Yggdrasil, Mount Olympus, Mount Meru

**Myths**:
 - Repositories for cultural ideas about issues like cosmology and cosmogony
 - Other stories: Princess and Frog (not myth, doesn't explain anything), King Arthur (more of legend)
 - Myths: True sacred stories occurring in remote past, contains non-humans, narrative of worldview

### Approaches to Myth
**Rationalist Approach**: Myth interprets and explains natural events and forces (Tylor, Frazer)
 - People fully believe myth as truth (creation myths), primitive science
 - Trickster gods can be shown pushing boundaries, either the repercussions or evolution of society

**Psychological Approach**: Interprets myth as symbolic, symbolism rooted in human psychology
 - Conflict between societal constraints and biological nature
 - Freud: Myths are irrational stories that represent unconscious wishes, conscious mind censors these
 - Carl Jung: Rejected Freud's sexual symbolism, believed elementary ideas or archetypes were building blocks of collective unconsciousness (universal model of a hero, mentor, quest, etc. Primordial images)
	 - Recurring patterns found in religion, mythology, art, and dreams of cultures worldwide
 - Joseph Campbell: Hero's Journey, Monomyth, all hero stories are fundamentally the same story

**Functionalist Approach**: Durkheim, myth reinforces social cohesion and unity
 - Malinowski: Myth and social reality were interrelated, myth confirms and maintains social structure
	 - Trobriand Origin Myth: Four main clans emerge from a cave in hierarchical order, justifies rank and right to land. Represented by totemic animal (legitimates food taboos)
 - Myth helps people navigate uncertainties, provides shared set of values to contribute to social order
 - Nyoro Myth: Uganda, king always had to belong to Bito clan. 3 sons given two tasks by God. Youngest becomes ruler and older brothers serve him. Succession by younger son is typical in Nyoro
 - Charter Myths: Narratives to explain societal origin. Foundational to identity. Legitimizes authority

**Structuralist Approach**: Discards overt functionalism. Myth provides conceptual vs normative support
 - Synchronic (ahistorical) rather than diachronic (change over time) approach
 - Myths emphasize binary opposites: Life/Death, Good/Evil, Nature/Culture
 - Claude Levi-Strauss: Interested in understanding nature of collective phenomena
	 - Elements of myth: mythemes. Like elements of language, meaningful only with other elements
	 - Study of myth fundamentally the study of thought, myths contain concealed messages
	 - Reveals natural, direct products of human thought, offer window into how human mind works
 - Harelips and Twins: Twins personify opposites (two halves of a whole), considered unnatural
	 - Salish Myth: Hare makes sexual joke, gets smacked in face splitting nose, if it continued to split it would have resulted in two individuals
	 - Hare is one of the highest Ojibwa deities, embodies opposites
	 - Twins and breech birth are splitting the mothers body, often killed in tribes when born

**Postmodernist Approach**: Reject universal explanations and grand theories as explanations of myth
 - Rejects idea of singular, universal meaning inherent in myths
 - Interpretation is subjective, shaped by identity of the interpreter
 - Emphasize importance of examining myths within their specific cultural contexts
