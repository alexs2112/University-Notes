### Popular Culture
 - High (or elite) culture: Smaller number of people, ideas of sophistication, education, etc
 - Folk culture: Passed down in a localized group, families, towns, more immediate people
 - Popular culture: Much larger groups, mass communication + media, more accessible
 - Pop culture with religion didn't really exist until the 15th century, particularly Western Europe
	 - Wood-block printing being invented, Gutenberg press, helped distribution of pop culture
	 - Church and religion *were* pop culture, go to church to socialize about religion

**Why Study Religion and Pop Culture?**
 - Both a mirror of and an influence on society
	 - Popularity of given cultural element is directly proportional to the degree to which the element is reflective of audience beliefs and values
	 - Popularity is an indication of what the public values
 - Pop culture elements can be a means of unlocking their meaning in culture as a whole

**Relationship Between Religion & Popular Culture**:
 - Takes the form of four different ways:
1. Religion in popular culture
2. Popular culture in religion
3. Popular culture as religion
4. Religion and popular culture in dialogue
### 1. Religion in Popular Culture
 - How does religion appear in expressions of pop culture? How is it portrayed?
 - At what points in pop culture is religion strikingly absent? What does it mean?
 - Movies illustrate how religion may appear on several different levels:
	 - Explicit representations
	 - Allegorical parallels
	 - Implicit theological themes

**Religious Allegories**:
 - Films can be examined for cross-cultural forms, including myth, ritual, systems of purity, gods
	 - Studied for ways Hollywood reinterprets, appropriates, invents, or rejects these archetypes
	 - Example: Aslan being Jesus in Chronicles of Narnia
 - Cinema is our premier form of cultural mythmaking
 - Recall Campbell's Monomyth: The Hero's Journey
	 - AKA The American Monomyth, the monomyth focuses on American society
 - Christ-like figures in movies:
	 - Special beings
	 - Suffering and persecution
	 - Leadership and influence
	 - Sacrifice
	 - Redemption
	 - Resurrection/Rebirth
	 - Moral attributes (integrity, compassion, forgiveness)
	 - Challenging status quo

**Superman (1978)**:
 - Superman (1978): Christian Themes
	 - Jor-El as heavenly father: "The son becomes the father, and the father the son" - Jor-el's farewell to Kal-el
	 - Kal-el = the "only son" sent with a "divine mission"
		 - Jor-El: "For this reason, above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you, my only son"
		 - John 3.16: "For God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten son"
	 - Clark as Christ-like figure
 - Superman (1978): Jewish Themes
	 - Cataclysm known to/believed by only one man and his family
		 - "I'll build a ship, an Ark of space, We'll transport our planet's entire populace to another world" - Jor-el (Genesis 6-9)
		 - Decide that Kal-el should be placed in the flier and sent to Earth (Exodus 2)
	 - el - the godlike nature of Superman's family name
	 - Immigration for the sake of survival
		 - Adopting a dual identity. Clark = the supreme metaphor for the Jewish experience
		 - Clark is Moses?
 - What can Superman tell us about religion and pop culture?
	 - Religiously multivalent: Different interpreters find various kinds of symbols and themes when examining the same aesthetic product
	 - Meaning is not found exclusively in a text or in the reader
		 - Constructed in the interaction between text and reader
