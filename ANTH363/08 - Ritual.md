### Rituals
 - Sometimes rituals reenact myths and stories
 - Sometimes involve a particular kind of attire and/or a specific location
 - Can be the reliving of an important event
 - Patterned form of behaviour, generally communal, consisting of prescribed actions and words
 - Usually deeply meaningful
 - There is no hard line between social rituals, sacred rituals, personal rituals, and ceremonies
 - When a purely functional act (drinking tea) becomes ritualized and given symbolic meaning, an ordinary social ritual can become a sacred ritual

**Definition of Ritual**:
 - Victor Turner: "a ritual is a stereotyped sequence of activities involving gestures, words, or objects, performed in a sequestered place and designed to influence preternatural [magical] entities or forces on behalf of the actorâ€™s goals or interests"
 - Alexander 1997: "Ritual defined in its most general or basic terms is a performance planned or improvised, that effects a transition from everyday life to an alternative context within which the everyday is transformed"
 - Anthony Wallace: "Ritual is religion in action"
