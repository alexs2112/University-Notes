### Functionalism
 - Early 1900s, preoccupation with *origins* of religion supplanted by other theoretical concerns
 - *Functional* approach to religion:
	 - What is the function of religion?
	 - What does religion **do** for people and for social groups?
 - Durkheim: *Elementary Forms of the Religious Life* - 1912
	 - If religion has give birth to all that is essential in society, it is because the idea of society is the soul of religion.

### Emile Durkheim
 - 1858 - 1917
 - French sociologist, established the field
 - Explored the role of religion in shaping social cohesion and moral order
 - An atheist, did not believe that a large human institution as religion was based on pure illusion
	 - Felt that "The most barbaric and fantastic religious rites and myths" must be for human need
 - Unwilling to define religion specifically in terms of the supernatural or the extraordinary
 - Dissatisfied with Tylor's minimal definition of religion as "belief in spiritual beings"
	 - Felt that there is a need for a broader definition of religion
 - *Elementary Forms of the Religious Life* (1912)
	 - Primary purpose: Describe and explain religion in "its most primitive and simple form"
	 - Secondary purpose: Understand how things are categorized, how these ideas relate to religion
 - Irreducible dichotomy between the "sacred" and the "profane"

**The Profane**:
 - "Outside the temple"
 - The ordinary, everyday aspects of life that are not imbued with religious significance
 - Anything not sacred lack the sanctity and special meaning attributed to the sacred
	 - Unholy, irreverent, contemptuous, blasphemous
 - Could damage or pollute the sacred by contact

**The Sacred**:
 - Aspects of life that are regarded as extraordinary, endowed with a special significance or holiness
	 - Recognition of a belief, power, or force
	 - Evokes feelings of awe, reverence, respect
 - Non-utilitarian - beyond the everyday
 - Non-empirical - beyond empirical nature, not based on knowledge from the 5 senses
 - Exerts a sense of moral obligation and ethical imperative
 - Not connected to the "divine" but prohibitions setting it apart from the profane
	 - Taboos, have to treat them differently than the profane
 - Divine objects, living creatures, places, elements of nature, days, abstract forces, persons, states of consciousness, past events, ceremonies, activities
 - The social group is more powerful than the individual
	 - It is the most powerful, society as a whole
	 - These social realities are symbolized with a name, banner, or totem

**Totemism**:
 - Derived from the Ojubwa word *ototeman*, meaning "ones brother-sister kin"
 - Denotes an object, especially an animal, which is sacred to a clan, family, or social unit
 - People have a mystical relationship/kinship with the entity, or totem
	 - Thought to interact with a given kin group or an individual
	 - Serve as their emblem or symbol
 - Division of labour in totemic societies
	 - Not highly stratified
	 - Ergo, relatively "simple" societies
 - Therefore: Durkheim assumes Totemism is the most basic, original form of religion
 - Clan members consider themselves bound together by a special kind of kinship
	 - Not based on blood, but the mere fact that they share the same name
	 - Name taken from an animal (usually), the totem
 - Each totemic group has a collection of ritual objects
 - The totem is often viewed as a companion, relative, protector, progenitor, or helper
	 - Superhuman powers and abilities are often ascribed to totems
 - Not only offered respect or veneration, can also become objects of awe and fear
	 - Often prohibition against killing, eating, touching, sometimes must shun it

**What Makes a Totem Sacred?**
 - **Totemic Emblem**: Essential to totemic belief
	 - A design that represents the clan's totemic entity
	 - Confers sacredness to whatever it is marked on
	 - Marks the sacred away from the profane (cannot be touched, etc)
 - **Totemic Entity**: Animal or plant species
	 - Dietary prohibitions
	 - Example: Muria are not allowed to eat their totem animal or plant, must mourn it if one dies
 - **Human Clan Members**:
	 - Use of blood and bodily parts in the rituals

**Durkheim's Explanation of Totemic Beliefs**:
 - Images, animals, and clan members are all sacred in the same way
	 - Sacred character not due to the special properties of one or the other, rather derived from some common principle shared by all
 - Totemism is not really about the totemic entity or the emblem, but about the clan itself
 - Experience of the social group alone can generate intense feelings that sustain religion
 - Totem is a god or a divinity, symbol for the group or society
	 - Therefore, god and society are one
	 - Power attributed to the totem is actually the power of society
 - Personification of the clan, represented as the visible for of the animal or vegetable as a totem
	 - i.e. When the group celebrates or worships its spirits/gods it is really celebrating or worshipping itself
 - Create a shared set of values, *mores*, based in beliefs and communal gatherings + rituals
 - Rituals operate through a psychological power he calls "effervescence"
	 - Intense, electrified, emotional energy one receives from shared identity and unity from a collective ritual experience
 - Function to promote unity in totemic groups

### Durkheim: Defining Religion
 - Religion can be divided into two parts, constitutes the union of **beliefs** and **rituals**
 - For Durkheim, any definition of religion must exclude magic, because magic is:
	 - **Individualistic**: Does not bind together those who adhere to it, not unite them
		 - Selfish, often involves rituals performed by individuals seeking to manipulate supernatural forces for personal gain or benefit
	 - **Instrumental**: Seen as a means to achieve specific practiced goals
		 - Often characterized by a utilitarian or instrumental approach to supernatural forces
	 - **Imminent**: Typically focused on immediate, tangible outcomes in the here and now
		 - Supernatural forces believed to be directly and immediately responsive
 - Whereas religion is:
	 - **Collective**: Communal phenomenon
		 - Rituals performed by a group of individuals, emphasizing shared beliefs and values of the community
	 - **Unifying**: Religion plays a crucial role in creating and maintaining social cohesion
		 - Rituals serve to bind people together, reinforcing sense of community
	 - **Transcendent**: Practices focused on transcendent and sacred realities that go beyond the immediate and tangible
		 - Supernatural forces are perceived as powerful, beyond direct human manipulation

**Durkheim's Definition**:
 - "A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden -- beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them."

**Critique**:
 - Too rigid separation between the sacred and the profane
 - Many hunter-gatherers (Andamanese) lack corporate kin groups and totems, but have religion
 - "Religion establishes and reaffirms group solidarity", symbolic significance for a society
	 - Society is not a homogenous entity, divided into social categories based on sex, class, ethnic affiliation, and religion
 - Religious beliefs may have an ideological function legitimating the domination of one group or class over another

### Durkheim Summary
 - Religion can be divided into two parts:
 - **Beliefs**: Durkheim emphasized the social nature of religious beliefs, suggesting that they are collective representations of the group's shared values and conscience
	 - All religious beliefs classify all things, real and ideal, into two classes or opposed groups
		 - The Sacred and the Profane
	 - He explored the idea of "totems" as symbols that embody the sacred and represent the collective identity of a community
 - **Rituals**: Proposed that rituals play a crucial role in maintaining social order and solidarity
	 - Structured framework for collective expressions of shared beliefs
