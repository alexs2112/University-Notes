### 1950s Onwards
 - Shift of ethnographic attention to local forms of world religions, such as Islam, Buddhism, Christianity
 - Shift of theoretical attention from Durkheim's functionalism to meaning of/in religion for people

### Clifford Geertz
**Interpretive Anthropology**:
 - Definition:
	 - Focuses on meaning and symbolism as it relates to the native's perspective
	 - Allows for many meanings of a symbol
	 - There is no one "key-to-the-universe" theory
 - Symbol: An object, gesture, sound, or image that stands for some other idea, concept, or object
	 - Something that has meaning, particularly when the meaning is arbitrary and conventional, thus culturally relative
 - Culture is not simply a set of symbols that fit into a structured analysis, but rather a series of complex webs

**Definition of Religion**:
 - A religion is a system of symbols, which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence, and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic.

**Interpretive Anthropology Approach**:
 - According to Geertz, religion should be approached from the standpoint of interpretive anthropology
 - Sees religion as a set of symbols
	 - Stresses the meaning of those symbols, as referents and creators of meaningful life
 - Religion is essentially a cultural system that gives meaning to human existence
 - Concerned with interpretation of rituals

**Symbolism and Meaning**:
 - Making and using symbols entails the cognitive ability to find or create and place meaning where it otherwise is not
 - Leslie White: Essence of culture itself was this process of "bestowing meaning upon a thing or an act, or grasping and appreciating meanings thus bestowed"
	 - Holy water is a prime example
	 - Holy water is water, physical and material, but humans add a dimension of holiness to it

**Geertz - Meaning**:
 - Religious beliefs provide meaning by:
	 - Offering explanations for anomalous events and experiences (Tylor)
	 - Giving comprehension and emotional support for human suffering (Malinowski)
	 - Offer a set of ethical criteria to guide human behaviour, helping individuals navigate the moral landscape and make sense of the moral discrepancies they encounter
 - Hence religious symbolism is intrinsically linked to what Geertz calls "the problem of meaning"
	 - Refers to the challenge of deciphering and interpreting the symbolic structures within a culture to understand the significance that individuals ascribe to their actions, rituals, social interatctions

**Geertz - Conclusion**:
 - Anthropological study of religion is, therefore, a two-stage operation
	 - An analysis of the system of meanings embodied in the religious symbolism
	 - The relating of these systems to social-structural and psychological processes
 - Separating religion from science, common sense, and aesthetics, Geertz gives religion a distinctive perspective and a universal and unique function: *To establish meaning*

### Mary Douglas
**Purity and Danger**:
 - Argued that beliefs are logical and symbolic efforts to impose order and meaning on the world through the use of contrasting categories
 - "Purity and Danger" highlights the role of symbolism in the construction and maintenance of cultural categories related to purity and impurity
	 - Clean and Unclean is the main dichotomy she was interested in
 - Symbols become powerful tools through which societies express and reinforce their cultural values and norms regarding cleanliness and order
 - Purity and pollution characterized as dirty or clean are found everywhere
	 - Example: Religious mandates that specify what is pure and permitted, vs what pollutes and is taboo
 - These shared cultural boundaries help maintain order and group identity

**The Human Body**:
 - Body excretes unclean materials, associated with the emotions of shame
 - Also connected with the unclean aspects of life (death and corpses)
 - India: Caste system draws on Vedic myth of Purusha's cosmic body
	 - Hierarchy defined by Head (Priests & Academics), Arms (Warriors & Rulers), Legs (Business Community), Feet (Servants), and Floor (Uncaste, untouchables, lower workers)
 - Human body becomes symbolic expression for ordering the society

### Victor Turner
**Ritual and Symbolism**
 - Referential symbols are used in ordinary speech or writing that have a relationship with some concrete item or fact
 - Rituals often involve symbolic actions and objects that convey deeper meanings
 - Symbols can be interpreted in multiple ways

**Concepts**:
 - Introduced *Liminality*: Concept which refers to transitional or in-between phases within rituals or social processes
	 - In these liminal phases, individuals experience a suspension of normal social roles and structures
	 - Symbolism is crucial in this context, represents the transformation of indivviduals or groups from one state to another
	 - Example: Graduation ceremonies
 - *Communitas*: A state of unstructured and egalitarian community that arises during liminal periods
	 - Symbolism helps create a shared sense of identity and belonging among individuals in communities
	 - Ritual symbols, gestures, or objects become potent expressions of collective experience and solidarity
 - Rituals and ceremonies as performative acts rich in ceremony not only communicate meanings but also actively engage participants in the creation of shared cultural narratives and identities

### Anthropology of Religion
 - Anthropology brings its unique perspective of cross-cultural or comparative study, holism, and cultural relativism
	 - Treating each religion in its own terms and relating it to its social and historical context
 - No single definition is entirely adequate, no definition is ever "true"
	 - Only more or less inclusive, and more or less productive
	 - How we define religion determines what we accept as religion
 - Anthropologists have found that religion itself is a culture-specific (Western) concept in the first place
	 - Not all cultures even have a word/concept for religion
	 - Talal Asad: Argues that the concept of religion itself is not a neutral or universal category, but is deeply embedded in Western history, culture, and power dynamics
