### Basic Concepts
 - Definition: *Reflection* is the ability of a running program to:
	 - Examine itself and the run-time environment (*Introspection*)
	 - Change its behaviour, structure, or data depending on what it finds
 - To do introspection, a program must have a representation of itself available at runtime
	 - Called *metadata*
	 - In an OO language, metadata is organized using *metaobjects*
		 - In Java, these are typically instances of classes like `Class.Method`, and `Field`
 - The normal, non-reflective part of a program is called the *base program*
	 - Consists of *base-level objects*
 - Each base-level object is an instance of some class
	 - This class is represented at the *metalevel* as a *class object* (an example of a metaobject)
 - The fields and methods for a class are represented with `Field` and `Method` metaobjects
	 - Are contained within the class object
 - Once introspection is done, you can change a program's structure, data, or behaviour
	 - Three general techniques:
		 - Direct metaobject modification
			 - Eg: Add methods or fields to an existing class
			 - Not possible in Java (avoids complications)
		 - Operations using metadata
			 - Eg: Dynamic method invocation, dynamic class loading, reflective construction
		 - *Intercession*
			 - Where code intercedes to modify its behavior as the program runs
			 - Typically involves intercepting method calls
			 - In Java, limited to dynamic proxies
 - Only a few languages support reflection
	 - Typically when run in an interpreter
	 - Eg: Java, Smalltalk, Python, Objective-C, Prolog, etc
