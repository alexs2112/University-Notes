### Sampling and Quantization
 - A continuous signal may be *sampled*
	 - Measured periodically at small intervals of time, converted into a series of numbers (samples)
		 - Such a series is a *digital signal*
	 - An *analog-to-digital converter* (ADC) does the sampling
		 - Eg. Sampling an audio signal
