### Midterm 1:
 - Open book with paper notes, 50 mins in class
 - 2 long questions
 - First question: Refactoring
	 - First refactoring must be a substantial refactoring that change the class diagram
	 - Second will be a simpler refactoring
	 - Asked: What the bad code smell is, which refactoring is used, say how it improves the code, rewrite the code
 - Second question: Reflection
	 - Write a small java program that will do various steps of reflective techniques
	 - Introspection onto an object
	 - Reflective method invocation
	 - Other reflective techniques
 - Nothing directly on version control or unit testing

### Final:
 - Saturday, December 9th, 5-7 PM, Auxiliary Gym (KNA 117)
 - Open book exam like the midterm
 - 3 long answer questions, equally weighted
 - First question: Refactoring
	 - Java code, asked to do 3-4 refactorings to it, at least one substantial refactoring
	 - Official name, bad smell, how it improves the code, rewrite the code with the refactoring
 - Second question: Reflective Programming Techniques
	 - Java code, very similar to A2 + A3, particularly A3
	 - Serialization + Deserialization will tell us exactly what will need to be produced (in XML)
 - Third question: Optimization Techniques
	 - C code, asked to do a series of hand-tuning optimizations
	 - No algorithm-based or compiler-level optimizations, no assembly optimizations
 - No digital signal processing, only learnt that so A4 would be difficult
