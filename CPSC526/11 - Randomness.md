### Fundamental Problem
 - Computers are very predictable
	 - Machine operations are deterministic
	 - Will do exactly the same steps at boot
	 - A room of identical computers will finish booting at same time
 - Without any user interaction, there will be no difference
 - Randomly generated numbers will always be the same
	 - Unless you introduce something from the environment

### Random Numbers & Security
 - Modern cryptography relies on random numbers
 - Random cryptographic keys (in hybrid crypto -> random symmetric key)
 - Random IVs (for CTR mode)
 - Random nonces (challenge/response protocols, DHKE)
 - Unique identifier

**Types of Randomness**:
 - True Randomness:
	 - Happens in nature, randomness from good sources (dice)
	 - Unpredictable from all information
		 - Cannot guess previous nor future numbers
		 - To an information theoretic attacker (infinite computation power)
		 - Next number is completely independent from all previous numbers
	 - Independent randomness
 - Pseudo Randomness
	 - Numbers that look random but may fail some statistical tests
		 - Can be predicted with the right information
	 - Numbers are not independent from other generated numbers

**Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNGs)**:
 - PRNGs generate a stream of pseudo random numbers
 - Using a seed and an algorithm
	 - The seed should be unique (typically)
	 - The same seed generates the same stream
 - Two types:
	 - Not cryptographically suitable: PRNG
		 - (`drand48()`, `rand()`, etc)
	 - Cryptographically suitable, CSPRNG
		 - Cryptographically secure/strong/suitable PRNG

**CSPRNG**:
 - Cryptographically suitable means that a computationally bounded adversary cannot distinguish a PRNG's random stream and a true random stream
 - We can test PRNGs output randomness using statistical tests
 - They hold up under other attacks
	 - Eg. when attacker learns some information about the state

**PRNG State**:
 - The seed is used to randomize the initial state
 - The state is then used to generate random numbers
 - If you know the state, you can generate the sequence of random numbers
 - Important for CSPRNG: Random numbers do not reveal the state

**CSPRNG Properties**:
 - Prediction Resistant:
	 - Looking at previous numbers, you cannot guess the next ones
	 - Even if attacker learned the state, he would not be able to predict future numbers, except maybe for a few of them
 - Rollback Resistant:
	 - Even if the attacker learns the current state, he cannot learn previous numbers generated by the stream leading up to the current state
	 - Similar to forward security

**Why is Rollback Resistance Useful?**:
 - Suppose PRNG is bad, or implementation has a bug
 - Typical use for crypto is to generate a key, then generate IV
 - IV is not encrypted when sent
 - Attacker could observe IV and learn key from it
