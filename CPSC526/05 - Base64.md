### Byte
 - Byte is a unit of data that almost always consists of 8 bits
	 - Allows storage of 256 different integers
	 - Typically in range [0, 255] but also [-128, 127]
	 - Some very old hardware does not contain 8 bits
		 - To avoid confusion, 8-bit value can be called an octet
	 - `int8_t`, `uint8_t`
 - Least significant byte (LSB):
	 - Rightmost bit, least significant digit
	 - Determines if number is even (lsb=0) or odd (lsb=1)
 - Most significant bit (MSB):
	 - In fixed-width representation, left most bit
	 - Otherwise, leftmost non-zero digit, analogous to the most significant digit
		 - Determines length of (shortest) binary representation

### ASCII
 - American Standard Code for Information Interchange
 - 7-bit code
 - Specifies 128 symbols and their encodings
	 - Latin alphabet, Arabic numbers, punctuation
	 - Basically anything you can see on the keyboard
	 - Plus some non-printable control chars, like tab, newline, carriage return, bell

**Unicode**:
 - An effort to include other characters from other languages
 - Wide-body ASCII (16 bits)

**UTF-8**:
 - 8-bit Unicode Transformation Format
 - Subsumes ASCII, has variable length encoding
	 - If byte is < 128, it is what ASCII would be
	 - If it is larger:
		 - Some bits indicate position in a giant lookup table of different code pages
		 - Some bits indicate positions on that code page
 - By far the most widely used encoding
	 - No extra effort required for ASCII support
	 - No extra cost for ASCII support

### Storing Numbers vs String
 - Number 4032109300
	 - First converted to hexdecimal: 0xf0551af4
	 - Consists of 4 digits, each represented by 2 hexadecimal digits
	 - These are stored as individual bytes
 - String "4032109300"
	 - Each ASCII digit is converted to its ASCII code
		 - "4"=0x34, "0"=0x30, "3"=0x33, ...
	 - Each of these 10 numbers are stored, with an additional `0x00` to denote end of string
 - Binary representation is more efficient than the textual representation
	 - 4 bytes vs 11 bytes

### Binary Encoding/Decoding
 - Many existing technologies put restrictions on which bytes can be used/transmitted
 - For example: SMTP only allows printable ASCII characters, plus few control chars
 - Similar restrictions exist for many other technologies
	 - HTML, CSS, C++ source code, Python source code, HTTP requests, etc
 - In many cases, only a subset of the printable characters is allowed
	 - It is usually possible to escape some of the disallowed characters
 - In order to store/transmit binary data it needs to be converted (encoded) to printable ASCII, and then eventually decode it back to binary
 - For example, in an email we could not send the number 4032109300 as binary (4 bytes, `0xf0`, `0x55`, `0x1a`, `0xf4`) because `0xf0`, `0xf4`, and `0x1a` are non-printable bytes, not allowed by SMTP
	 - We could send the number as an ascii string, but that would require 12 bytes which is a waste of resources (`"4032109300\\0"`)

### Base64 (not base 64)
 - Base64 is a mechanism for encoding/decoding arbitrary binary data to/from a printable string
 - Base64 converts arrays of arbitrary bytes to/from arrays of restricted bytes
 - Base64 uses printable ASCII characters
	 - `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/`
	 - `=` is used for padding at the end if needed
 - Rough encoding algorithm:
	 - Break input into groups of 24 bits (3 bytes)
	 - Each group of 24 bits is broken into 4 groups of 6 bits each
	 - Each group of 6 bits is replaced by one printable character (as above)
	 - If input is not a multiple of 3 bytes, padding is used
 - Overhead over binary storage: 3 bytes -> 4 printable characters
	 - 33% extra storage used when converting to Base64

**Examples**:

| ASCII: | a | b | c |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| hex: | `0x97` | `0x98` | `0x99` |
| binary | 01100001 | 01100010 | 01100011 |
This translates to:
	011000 = 24 = Y
	010110 = 22 = W
	001001 = 09 = J
	100011 = 35 = j
encoded as YWJj

| ASCII: | a | b |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| hex: | `0x97` | `0x98` |  |
| binary | 01100001 | 01100010 | -- |
This translates to:
	011000 = 24 = Y
	010110 = 22 = W
	001000 = 09 = I
encoded as YWI=
 - Single '=' means that 1 byte (8 bits) of 0 padding was used

| ASCII: | a |  |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| hex: | `0x97` |  |  |
| binary | 01100001 | -- | -- |
This translates to:
	011000 = 24 = Y
	010000 = 16 = Q
encoded as YQ==
 - Double '=' means that 2 bytes (8 bits) of 0 padding was used

**Base64 on Command Line**:
```
urist@ubuntu:~$ echo yeet > yeet
urist@ubuntu:~$ base64 < yeet
eWVldAo=
```

**Base64 in Python**:
```python
import base64
with open("face.jpg", "rb") as fd:
	s = base64.b64encode(fd.read())
print(s)
```
```python
# Calculate 10^50 prime, convert to hex, then convert to Base64
import sympy, base64, binascii
n = sympy.nextprime(10**50)
print(f"{n=}")
hn = hex(n)
print(f"n(hex)={hn}")
binn = binascii.unhexlify(hn[2:])
b64n = base64.b64encode(binn)
print(f"n(Base64)={b64n}")

"""output
