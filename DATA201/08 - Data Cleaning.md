### Dirty Data
 - **Sources of Error**: Data entry, Measurement, Distillation, Data integration
 - **Data Entry**
	 - Human error, most common
	 - Not specific in asking questions (no units asked, etc)
	 - Stupid questions
 - **Measurement**
	 - Inaccurate/differing tools
	 - Inaccurate people
	 - Calibration issues
 - **Distillation**
	 - Rounding errors
	 - Not storing everything that was collected (changing the data, you can't revert the change once data is lost)
	 - Storing the data in confusing ways
 - **Data Integration**
	 - Data comes from multiple sources (might have different formats)
	 - Schemas change over time

### Common Data Quality Issues
 - **Missing Data** - Missed measurements, redacted items, incomplete forms, etc
 - **Erroneous Values** - Misspellings, outliers, "spurious integrity", etc
 - **Entity Resolution** - Different values, abbreviations, 2+ entries for the same thing
 - **Type Conversion** - Problematic conversions, losing precision, inaccuracy
 - **Data Integration** - Mismatches and inconsistencies when combining data
