**Tables**: Not a chart. A type of visualization, mostly just values with colours and formatting
**Bar Charts**: Horizontal bar charts are good to use when row names are very long (to read horizontally)
**Histograms**: A form of bar chart that can handle ranges of values, where the columns are directly related to each other
**Line Charts**: Good for change over time. Area charts are when the area under the line is coloured (more visual) and actually matters, most area charts are useless
**Pie Charts**: For comparing big differences between different things directly, sucks for things that are close in value. Don't use these, just worse than bar charts
**Scatter Charts**: Large amounts of difficult  to parse data to see general trends
**Map Charts**: Quite limited, because it is a map
