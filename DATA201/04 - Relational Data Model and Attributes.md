### Relational Data Model
 - Relation: Table of data
 - Tuple: Row
 - Attribute: Column
 - Schema: Blueprint/Table Structure
 - Database: A collection of relations

### Types of Attributes
 - Dimensions: discrete variables (categories, names)
	 - Nominal and Ordinal
 - Measures: can be aggregated, usually continuous (weight, height)
	 - Interval and Ratio

Data with different levels of measurement are best to encode in different ways.
Dimensions and Measures are important concepts in many analysis tools.
