### Visual Variables
 - The ways we can modify marks
 - **Position**, can be used to order or group data
 - **Size**, can be used to order and compare data
	 - Difficult to use for quantitative data as you can't directly compare different values (how much bigger is A to B)
 - **Value** (brightness), can be used to order and group data
	 - Not good for quantitative data, can't easily compare different brightnesses
 - **Texture**, good for grouping data
	 - Bad for comparing and ordering data
 - **Color**, also good for grouping data
	 - Bad for ordering (scale of color), bad for comparing quantitative data
 - **Orientation**, fine for grouping data
	 - Bad for ordering and comparing data
 - **Shape**, fine for grouping data
	 - Bad for ordering and comparing data
 - There are others, we will focus on these ones

### Characteristics of Visual Variables
 - **Selective** - Differentiate items from groups
 - **Associative** - Group items in a group
 - **Quantitative** - Changes in terms of numerical reading
 - **Order** - Perceive an order
 - **Variations / Length / Resolution** - Distinguishable variations
