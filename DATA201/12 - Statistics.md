### Data Analysis
 - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Process of gathering evidence, much like detective work
 - **Confirmatory Data Analysis**: Process of evaluating evidence is comparable to a court trial
	 - Testing hypotheses from graphs and charts
 - Understanding data and drawing conclusions, visualizations can help

### Terms
 - **Mean**: Average, useful if the data points are all close to the mean
 - **Variance**: Square the difference of each data point and divide by the number of points
	 - Not super accurate
 - **Standard Deviation**: Take the square root of the variance, makes more sense

### Descriptive Statistics
 - Gives information that describes the data in some manner
 - Measures of Center: 
	 - central tendency
	 - mean/average (affected by extreme outliers)
	 - median (middle value of a sorted set, not affected by extreme variance, useless for nominal)
	 - mode (most frequently occurring value)

### Inferential Statistics
 - Uses descriptive statistics to estimate population parameters

### Measures of Spread
 - How data points are deviated from the average of a distribution
 - Box plot: Breaking the data into four quarters, two on each side of the median between the maximum and the minimum
	 - Break full sorted data in half by finding the median, then find the median of each half. That is four quarters
 - Range: Difference between max and min
 - Interquartile Range (IQR): The difference between Q3 and Q1 of a box plot (the center two halves)
