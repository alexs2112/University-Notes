### CompuServe
 - Classmates Jeff Wilkins, John Goltz set up a time sharing service: CompuServe Networks Inc, as part of the Golden United Life Insurance company
 - Goltz served as the first president
 - The network was built using lines that were leased from AT&T
 - Using proprietary network hardware and software, their network outperformed AT&Ts
 - Unlike traditional timeshare, CompuServe developed programs that were installed on CompuServe's computers and managed by their staff
	 - Clients paid extra to use them
 - Also experimented with performing information products:
	 - Database of an extensive list of consumer merchandise
 - Company was successful, only flaw was that 50% of the time the network was idle
 - Microcomputer users (available since the early 1970s) became a market
	 - People bought modems with the microcomputers even though there was little to connect to: 110-300 bps
 - At the same time, prices of mainframes began to drop sufficiently, companies began to buy rather than timeshare
 - CompuServe had idle computers and a local phone number in almost every city
 - Wilkins saw three things to draw in microcomputer users to CompuServe:
	 - Speed and ower of the mainframes
	 - Storage: At the time nobody made harddrives for micros (floppy drives cost almost as much as the computer ~$500) so most data was stored on tape
		 - CompuServe's mainframes used several 20 MB hard drives
	 - Communication: Email and a public bulletin board system where users could read and leave public messages under different threads
	 - Ability to purchase and download software
		 - No computer store could stock them all, CompuServe provided greater selection
		 - Games were text only and considerably smaller (StarTrek was the most popular one)
 - Initial user group consisted of technically-minded people who could/would program for the network
	 - At first they tried free access for these early adopters
 - 1979: Implemented pay only: $9 startup fee, $5/hour during off hours, $12/hour primetime
	 - 100 bps (regular), 300 bps (premium), eventually upgraded to 1200 bps
	 - In these days, $3-4 would pay for a movie
 - Command line interface like the micro computers of the time
	 - Menu interface developed quickly when more users connected

### The Source
 - Founded by Bill Von Meister
 - Technical whiz kid
	 - Alarm of approaching dad to make some tea
 - An entrepreneur: Started 9 companies in 10 years, longest he stayed at was 2 years, forced out of most of them
	 - Liked the excitement of starting a new company but not the drudgery of running one
 - Envisioned a system: InfoCast
	 - Sometime after 1978 when FCC legalized the public piggybacking of digital data on FM radio broadcasts
	 - Send news, weather, business, sports reports from a central location to FM stations around the country via PSNs (Packet Switched Networks) and phone lines
	 - The company DBC (Digital Broadcast Corporation) was formed to produce and market InfoCast
 - Homes would receive broadcasts through rented receivers
 - Users would be able to send data, even exchange messages
 - Jack Taub and Consolidated Industries of America provided financial backing (1978)
 - Von Meister soon realized it wasn't feasible to outfit millions of American households with receiver/transmitters (and infrastructure to broadcast/decode)
	 - Would require hundreds of millions of dollars
	 - Wireless connections through cellular signals wasn't an option
 - He got GTW Telenet (later SpringNET) to provide their network on off peak hours
 - For Telenet, their upfront cost was nil (no risk)
 - Customers would pay $100 signup fee and $4.60/off hour
	 - Regarded as a bargain
	 - $100/hour for access to the New York Times Information Bank
 - CompuCon (Von Meister's network) was to provide but not create content (third parties like New York Times, Prentice Hall, Dow Jones would do so)
	 - Provided information, messaging, games (all produced by others)
 - Interface: Choice of text menu or command line
 - Went live in late spring 1979, not as CompuCon but as The Source
 - Acted like the early web
 - By Oct 1979 DBC (company behind the Source) was bogged down in $5m in debt
	 - Taub fired Von Meister
 - Technical problems: only 80-100 could log in at a time, time lags of up to 10 seconds during peak hours
	 - Solutions were a year away
 - Some customers left for CompuServe, some returned back to the Source because it was familiar to them and there was a sense of community
 - Eventually Taub himself was fired from the Source, retained control of DBC
 - Taub reorganized the company as NIU (National Information Utilities)
	 - System was to broadcast computer games and other programs
		 - Might also be the ability for subscribers to record their favourite TV programs for a fee
	 - The idea went nowhere
 - Eventually CompuServe bought out the Source
	 - Memberships were terminated, members could become CompuServe members and get some free time

### Gameline
 - Von Meister thought of a gaming service for a new company he founded (CVC, Control Video Corporation) after leaving the Source/DBC
 - Atari 2600 was a game console that was released in the late 1970s
 - Von Meister envisioned an oversized cartridge for $60 that would plug into the console, contained:
	 - A modem (dials a toll free number) and download data
	 - Memory so it could store a game (cost $1) as well as transmit joystick and trigger movements back to Gameline's mainframe computer
	 - Atari market was huge, ~13m in the US alone
 - The game would remain on the machine until it was shut off or another game was downloaded
 - Theoretical benefits:
	 - Gamer got to try out many games ($40+ each)
	 - Game companies got royalties
 - Problems:
	 - None of the game companies would provide the executable for their games (so it could be downloaded) so games had to be reverse engineered
 - 1983: Steve Case was hired by Gameline
	 - Younger brother of a major Gameline investor (hired to watch over Von Meister and his spending)
	 - Case knew nothing about computers besides a college course from years ago (he hated it)
	 - Intelligent, but quiet and thoughtful (the least quotable human at the company)
 - Later problems:
	 - May 1983: Atari announced it had lost a billion dollars in the first quarter of 1983 (first business to lose so much money in so short period of time). Gamelines success depended entirely on Atari's success
	 - The 2600 was old, Atari was focusing on the Atari 400 computer to keep up with newer game consoles
	 - Developers were producing discounted cartridge (Atari discounted console prices, was counting on cartridge sales)
 - Eventually CVC closed down

### Quantum Computer Services
 - CVC was reincarnated on May 1985 as Quantum Computer Services with a deal with Commodore for an online service
 - Down to 10 employees, to ramp up the Commodore service 15 more were hired
 - Nov 1, 1985: New online service Q-Link went live, people began logging in immediately
 - Q-Link had the usual online features: Email, games, bulletin boards, file downloads, shipping, chat, news, SIGS
	 - Many ambitious plans: eg, A Dungeons and Dragons role playing MMORPG
	 - It charged $9.95/month and $0.08 a minute for most of the services
	 - Packet switched networks connected at 300-1200 bps with access only after 6 PM weekdays (all day weekends)
	 - Games were programmed in BASIC and assemby
 - Eventually Quantum finally got Apple to agree to a deal to develop an online service for them
	 - Helped that Q-Link was a graphical system that was regarded as the easiest online service to use
 - AppleLink-Personal Edition went live May 1988
 - Quantum marketed the service with ads and disks in computer magazines (foreshadowing AOLs free disk distribution campaigns)
 - PC-Link: Developed for Tandy's (Tandy Radio Shack) IBM compatible computers, went online August 1989
 - Additional Quantum client resulted in problems:
	 - Apple didn't like Quantum spending time on the PC version, they wanted major changes in the service
		 - Devote all their free time to Apple, wanted Quantum to spend more on marketing (money that they didn't have)
	 - Before the end of 1989, just as the Macintosh version was to go online, the plug was pulled on AppleLink-Personal Edition
	 - However the contract did not prohibit Quantum from running an Apple online service, this was done by retooling the software to exclude the Aple logo
	 - The Apple name couldn't be used, new name: America Online was used for Quantum's onine service

### AOL
 - America Online (named by Steve Case, noticed many successful American companis has 3 letter names)
 - Case decided the service should be friendlier than others
	 - "Welcome", "You've got mail", "File's Done", "Goodbye"
	 - Voices could be turned off or substituted with other sounds
 - October 1989: America Online went online
 - October 1991: Quantum legally changed its name to America Online, more commonly known as AOL
 - RPG: Neverwinter Nights
	 - Implemented, almost entirely, the DND roleplaying rules
**Marketing**:
 - 1993: AOL marketer Jan Brandt (successful direct marketing campaign for children's books) developed a direct marketing campaign for AOL
 - Initial test: Disks sent to general mailing lists
	 - Many weren't even computer users, or they didn't own computers with modems
	 - Initial conversion rate was 10% (200k people at the cost of $250k), much higher than typical 1%-2%
 - Marketing program that followed: Disks were not only mailed out but given out en masse: concerts, in stores, bundled with other products, etc
	 - Carpet bombing America with disks
 - Campaign was too successful:
	 - AOL soon grew to 500k members
	 - So many that people couldn't log on when they wanted to, or they experienced slow downs when they did
	 - New members continued signing on

### BBS Connections
 - Microcomputer Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)
 - Connection wasn't to a network, instead it was a connection to another computer via modem
	 - Software: Accept calls, handle logins, transfer files, send emails (not always real time), message boards
	 - 1978: First bulletin board set up by Ward Christensen and Randy Seuss: CBBS (Computerized Bulletin Board SYstem)
	 - By late 1980s: Magazines like Popular Mechanics and Thrasher skateboarding set up their own BBSs to complement or substitute for their presence on CompuServe or AOL
 - BBSs helped sell modems: BBS users outnumbered CompuServe and The Source users for many years
 - Modems and software became easier to use, cost drops helped speed migration to online services, eventually to the Internet
	 - Early internet users established their connections with modems (2400-14400 bps)
 - Some BBSs ran software (like FIDO and GTE PowerComm) formed the basis of national networks relaying information between nodes
	 - BBS users paid a small fee for the relay service, to some it was worth it to communicate with someone around the world
 - Direct dial to a network was faster than indirect connections via a PSN but a long distance charge must be paid
 - Some of the largest boards were miniature versions of CompuServe or the Source (256 users at once)
 - Release of the Web caused BBS membership to steeply decline, BBS companies who didn't become ISPs shut down
	 - Some have resurrected themselves, can be accessed via remote logins (eg telnet) instead of a modem
 - **Canadian Conenctions**:
	 - DataPac: Canadian regional network operated by Bell Canada and Northern Telcom
	 - Nucleus: Started as Calgary based BBS with the goal of becoming one of the largest BBSs in Western Canada

### Evolution of the Networks
 - Games:
	 - Commercial games could be downloaded (sans packaging and manuals, greater selection and lower cost)
	 - Online gaming:
		 - At first: Text only adventure, role playing games on CompuServe and The Source
		 - Later games with graphics were added
 - Online Chat:
	 - Jeff Wilkins (CompuServe CEO) didn't see its value at first
	 - Wasn't listed in the menu, users could secretly access the chat functionality (`go cb`)
		 - Number of secret accesses was greater than expected
	 - When chat became the largest billing product it was finally added (officially) to the menu
 - Some members were addicted to the online world such that they couldn't pay their bill
	 - Some bills would reach $700 (movies were only a few dollars)
	 - A few members would disappear one month while they paid down their bills and returned later
 - The term "Phising" was not used then, occurrences of members impersonating system administrators in order to get access to another member's account
	 - Fake administrator would rack up charges on the compromised member's account
 - Interface:
	 - Initially, text and command line (32 or 40 columns x 16 lines)
	 - Later menus (text) were added (command line shortcuts were still possible)
	 - Most online services: GEnie, DELPHI, etc, focused on improving reliability and response time
		 - CompuServe stayed up  (because of redundancies and good coding practices) when other services went down during the crash of 1987
		 - GEnie included satellite links so 87 San Francisco users could still login even when links to all phone lines were broken by the earthquake
	 - Success of QLink and AOL proved that appearance and ease of use were just as important
	 - By the time that ease of use issues were addressed it was sometimes too little, too late (Source, bought out)

### MCI & AT&T
 - 1983: MCI Telecommunications launched its $100m email service
	 - First large brand name company to establish a commercial online service
 - Also pioneered email connection to the internet (hired Vint Cerf)
 - Built what would become the backbone of the internet
	 - National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) in the late 1980s
 - AT&T responded with AT&T mail (similar to MCI) but added Mail Talk (robot read emails)
 - These big companies had little effect on the online services like CompuServe (provided more than just email)

### Delphi
 - Parent was General Videotext Corp (GVC)
 - Went live March 1983
	 - Online access to the Cadillac Modern Encyclopedia, news, weather, classified as well as gateways to other services
	 - Delphi Oracle would answer any question (often tongue in chief)
 - 1984, other features were added: Chat, SIGS (Special Interest GroupS)
 - Set up local dial up numbers in major cities to reduce the (minimal) cost of PSNs for a flat fee
	 - The customer could transition to a national service and pay regular Delphi rates
 - Through the 1980s it vied with the Source to be the second largest online service

### GEnie
 - GEnie (General Electric Network for Information Exchange)
 - General Electric offered time sharing services in the 1960s under the name General Electric Information Services (GEIS)
	 - At this time, biggest player in time sharing, 40% of the market
 - GEnie went live October 1985 with some basic services: Email, personal computing SIGs, news, weather, sports
 - Game offerings started out sparse, later change as online multiplayer games would become a major focus
	 - Multiplayer BattleTech (MechWarrior I)
 - Half the cost of CompuServe at the higher speeds ($5 an hour at 1200 and 2400 bps)

### Playnet
 - Howard S. Goldberg and David Panzl left General Electric in 1982 to found Playnet Inc. associated with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)
 - Unique features: Graphics and colour (often used templates and graphical elements) were loaded from disk and combined in different ways, didn't need to be downloaded
 - Games and other programs were also on the user's disk
	 - If parts of Playnet changed then the user's disks would be updated while the member was online
	 - Playnet distributed the software on 3 disks (only way to access)
	 - Games and other programs were also on the users disk
 - Development time took so long the software focused on Commodore computers (IBM and Apple versions planend)
 - 1980s: 3 million Commodore users
	 - 1985: CompuServe had 130k subscribers, the Source had 40k
 - 1984: Playnet opened and it offered email, bulletin boards, chat, instant messages
	 - Also single and multiplayer games (checkers, poker, bridge, etc)
 - Compared to other services, Playnet was a bargain: $29.99 signup (3 disks), $6 per month plus $2/hour
 - Commodore already had a very profitable deal with CompuServe, didn't support Playnet much but it still flourished
 - Playnet was a trailblazer: Stunning Commodore graphics, multiplayer online games

### Prodigy
 - April 11, 1988: CBS, Sears, IBM released the service Prodigy with limited rollout in few US cities
	 - National introduction was September, by then CBS had financial problems and dropped out
 - Meant for non-computer modem users (just start the software and go)
 - Advertised in magazines, newspapers, and on TV
	 - It was expensive: $1500 to acquire a new customer, GEnie was only $35, CompuServe was less than half
 - Looked just like TV graphics, better even than AOL
 - Lacked some things, offered some innovations: Flat rate pricing $9.95 per month, online shopping
 - Membership grew quickly, by 1991 it had 600k subscribers, second only to CompuServe's 750k
	 - Illegitimate counting?
 - Made money through online ads at the bottom of each screen and from a portion of the sales made
 - Had great graphics, was fast as the most common accessed material was cached on a local machine in each city (assumed most traffic would just be passive reading)
	 - Leased lines would transfer data for requested information between cities
 - Didn't have any downloading, not even email or bulletin board text could be saved to disk
	 - Trying to avoid problems and legal infringements
	 - Manually write it down yourself
 - Presented as a family friendly place that was open to everyone: Sponsored summer picnics and rental amusement parks, inviting all members
 - Software was a closed system, could not upload/download or save anything to disk
 - With a family friendly image, staff felt the need to control content
	 - 1991: Began to censor boards (inspired by anti-semitic comments copied from private email message and replies to those boards)
	 - Post was deleted by staff, poster attempted to repost several times, each time it was deleted
	 - Became a big issue, eventually censored all boards with certain words, posts with member names (defamation), brand names were excluded (copywrite)
	 - Trying to control some posts incited other members to post even more offensive material
		 - Had to pay a lot to hire censors
	 - Members retaliated by organizing mass mailings, adding a few words and then resending them
		 - Telecommunications costs grew
 - Due to rising costs, had to go from flat rate to a usage-based model, people were unhappy
	 - Popularity fell
	 - Jan 1, 1991: 30 messages per month free, after that 25c per message
	 - Flat rate was raised from $12.95 to $14.95
	 - "Prodigy sucks!" t-shirts rose in popularity
 - 1994: Implemented a chat that offered unlimited service with no surcharge
	 - Costs skyrocketed and Prodigy had to shut down the chat
	 - Out came the "Prodigy sucks!" shirts again
 - Eventually Y2K problems forced it to either spend more money or shut down, the latter occurred

### 1989 Memberships
 - CompuServe 500,000
 - AOL 100,000
 - GEnie 100,000
 - The Source 50,000 (eventually bought out by CompuServe)
 - DELPHI 60,000

### 1991 Memberships
 - CompuServe 750,000
 - Prodigy 600,000
 - AOL 300,000

### Private Networks: 1990s and Beyond
 - 1988: Non-research, non-government, non-military civilians were given a public link to the Internet through the FidoNET BBS network (BBS newsgroups)
 - 1990: Several more public links to the internet were created:
	 - UUNET began operating as a nonprofit commercial source of Usenet newsgroups
	 - CIX in the UK began providing email and newsgroups
	 - MCI, CompuServe, Sprint all had email links to the internet
	 - 3 commercial ISPs were created: UUNET, PSINET, CERFNET
 - Usually access included email and newsgroups
 - Web wasn't wildly popular until the Mosaic browser was released in 1993
 - Overt commercial use of the internet was originally forbidden, 1992 DELPHI found a legitimate reason to include it in its online offerings
	 - Nov 1992: Internet email added
	 - Shortly after that, Usenet, Telnet, FTP, MUDs and text-based web access was added
	 - $3 surcharge per month for internet access
 - 1993: National Infrastructure Act passed, makes access to the internet as wide as possible
	 - Restriction on commercial usage is relaxed
 - 1993: All/most of the private networks began to offer an internet connection in a piecemeal fashion
	 - First with email
	 - Later other services like newsgroups and ftp were added gradually
 - Internet was a fair learning curve for most users of private networks
	 - Lots of configuration of your computer and memorization of steps
 - Web itself was a bit overwhelming in detail:
	 - Which browser to use (unless preconfigured by the ISP)
	 - What could and could not be done
	 - Determine how to collect email
	 - Where to find the interesting material online
	 - Etc
 - AOL merged with Time Warner 2000 (eventually split 2009), was the largest ISP
 - CompuServe acquired in 1998 by AOL which remains as an ISP
 - GEIS sold GENIE which was eventually shut down (GEIS was later sold by GE)
 - DELPHI was sold to Rupert Murdoch's New Corporation (1993)
	 - Some of Delphi's original management bought it back in 1996

### Internet vs Private Networks
 - Pre 1990s, early 1990s: Proprietary networks had millions of users, internet was largely obscure
|Private Networks|Internet|
|---|---|
|Controlled by one company (access, content)|Network built by researchers, gov't people with no central direction|
|More secure (fewer problems with illegal behaviour and threats), less innovation|Not designed to have mainstream dominance|
|Users connected to a network like CompuServe through dumb terminals: Could exchange data but not programs|Internet became so popular by assuming everyone was contributing goodwill, people would not behave destructively even without ways to monitor or stop them|
| |For the early years, this assertion largely held|
**Security and Software**
|Private Networks|Internet|
|---|---|
|Networks could not be programmed by users, software was centrally distributed by administrators working for the company|Internet of 1988 had no central control points to scan traffic for malware and stop it|
|Software only include what the company thought was economically viable (safer, restricts innovation)|End Points of the internet could become infected because they were general purpose computers, connection to the network not strictly controlled|
|Networks evolved slowly, few changes being made (good or bad)|Sometimes administrators of endpoints didnt bother fixing vulnerabilities, or set up network in secure fashion (bad passwords)|
|They were secure, it was sterile vs the internet|Many of the early users are even more ignorant and neglectful of good security practices|
| |Reduced consequences in mid 1990s most users only connected via slow dialups, werent always on|
