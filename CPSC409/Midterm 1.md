### Fingers
 - Finger reckoning multiplication
 - Finger counting: Sum, Binary, Chinese

### Abacus
 - Chinese abacus: 5s and 2s
 - Japanese abacus: 4s and 1s
 - Table abacus: Lines for each 10s space, spaces for each half
 - Abacus on Language: 
	 - Arithmetic and Abacus became interchangeable, 1200 AD
	 - Roman calculi stones

### Astrolabes
 - Common uses: Position of celestial bodies, latitude, time
	 - Height of objects, horoscopes, probably not as relevant?
 - Origins: 225 BCE by Apollonius
 - Time Period of Use: Used by the Arab empire, 600-1600 AD
 - Major Parts: 
	 - Outer Backing: Mater/Mother
	 - Metal: Plates/Climate/Tympanum
	 - Cut-Away Disk: Rete/Net/Network

### Quadrant
 - Same uses as the astrolabe, quarter circle astrolabe
 - Invented 1618 by Gunter

### Proportional Compass
 - Allow you to scale an image to any other size

### Sector
 - Galileo was widely attributed as the creator
 - Artillery calculations: Hangs off the edge of the artillery to calculate angles and distances

### Gelosia Method of Multiplication:
 - Practice this before test
 - Probable origins: India and later Arab, Persian, Chinese societies by the Middle Ages

### Napier's Bones
 - Used to perform multiplications, calculate logarithms
 - Each bone is a number that corresponds to a column of the Gelosia table

### Genaille-Lucas Rulers
 - Similar to Napier Bones, does not require operator to remember the carry
 - Each digit points to the next digit, for multiplication you start at the rightmost column (top number in the row of the multiplied number) and follow the arrows to the left
	 - For division you start at the leftmost column (top number in the row of multiplied number) and follow the arrows to the right

### Logarithms
 - John Napier given credit, others were unpublished or unrecognized
 - Can be used to simplify complex calculations by using a logarithm table

### Slide Rulers
 - Mechanical implementations of the logarithmic tables
 - Mathematical Functions: Multiplication, Division, Trigonometry, Roots, Powers
 - Modern Inventor: 1850, French artillery officer Amedee Mannheim
 - How it works: Both sides are marked with logarithmic scale, the sliding piece aligns with one of the fixed strips to observe the relative positions of other marks to get calculated results
 - Difference between Older and Modern: Added sliding cursor, any scales could easily be compared

### Antikythera Device
 - Found: 1900, Greek Sponge Fisherman checking out a shipwreck
 - Appearance, condition: Lump of encrusted bronze, very deteriorated
 - Date of Creation: Reported by Cicero (1st century BC), used to reproduce the position of the sun, moon, and planets
 - Significance: Contained complex gears that do not reappear until much alter

### Differential Analyzer
 - Approximate Creation Date: Late 1920s, publication 1931
 - Use: Solves differential equations by integration
 - Key People and Events:
	 - Vannevar Bush (MIT): First to produce a working machine
 - Copies:
	 - MIT: World War II version used to solve ballistic trajectories
	 - Manchester: First machine of its kind outside of America
	 - Oslo: German occupation of Norway in WWII, Rosseland removed all precision and buried the pieces in the ground

### Early Mechanical Computing Devices
 - Common Attributes:
	 - Setup (input)
	 - Selector (operation)
	 - Register (stored result)
	 - Carry (handling carries)
	 - Control (alignment, avoid false results and jamming)
	 - Erasing Mechanism (clear result)
 - Major Challenge: Propagating the carry

### Shickard's Calculator
 - Shickard (1592-1635): First true adding machine to handle a carry
	 - Bestie (gay) with Johannes Kepler
 - Napier's Bones: Rotating knobs for input that affects the Napier's bones to display the resulting values through a small register
 - Carry: Result of additions pushed into the next column with a single toothed gear
 - Limit of the Carry: Propagated several times could damage the machine
 - Could only do Addition
 - Eventual Fate: Unknown, family died to plague and machine trashed

### Pascal (1623-1662)
 - Early Childhood: Homeschooled, read the forbidden math books
 - Design, Development of Pascaline:
	 - Tax collecting family, tedious calculations
	 - Tried to get others to build his design, eventually learned mechanics and metalworking to do it himself
 - End of Life: illness, died at 39 (1662)

### Pascaline
 - Operation: A series of dials for each number, turning the dial would turn the gear and increment the value of that digit, propagating the carry to the next dial if needed
	 - Could do both Addition and Subtraction
 - Carry: Complex system of falling weights that are pushed by an extra pin on the 9s of the previous digit
 - Fate: Not profitable, very delicate and few survive to today

### Leibniz's Machine
 - Leibniz (1646 - 1716)
	 - Unsuccessful at constructing by himself
	 - Enlisted M. Oliver to help him (clockmaker)
	 - Difficult to get along with, not mourned
 - Stepped Drum Implementation:
	 - Really long gear where the teeth length are relative to the digit value
	 - Ripple carry through multiple digits needed to be manually propagated
 - Could do all of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division

### Morland's Machine
 - Morland (1625-1695)
 - Function: Stylus driven pocket calculator, 8 dials to convert different 10s-10000s, and then 4,12,20 currency units
	 - Additional versions using round napiers bones for multiplication
 - Carry: Didn't have a carry mechanism, had to do it manually

### Grillet's Machine
 - Date of Publish: 1678, marketing brochure

### Commercially Produced Mechanical Calculators
 - Thomas Arithmometer
 - Baldwin-Odhner Machines
 - Key-Driven Machine, Comptometers

### Thomas Arithmometer (1820s-1914)
 - Modern version of the Leibniz Machine (stepped drum)
 - Impact: Industry to use mechanical devices in calculation
	 - Too large and clunky

### Baldwin-Odhner Machines (1885-1965)
 - Baldwin: USA ; Odhner:  Europe
 - Variable Toothed Gear: Each wheel had gears with variable numbers of teeth (0-9), you could set which gear would be used per wheel
	 - This way it would add a specific number to the result equal to the number of teeth, like the Leibniz machine
 - Benefit: 4 function calculator (Arithmometer) but much smaller, could sit on a desk. Still clunky to use

### Key Driven Machines
 - Advantage: Much better UI, sped up computation time as it was way easier to use
 - Development History: Mr. Dorr E. Felt first to make functional key driven Comptometers (1885-1886)
