### Preclassic - Classic Transition
 - Transition Period:
	 - Populations grew
	 - Intensive agriculture
	 - Writing becomes more common
	 - Pottery starts being imported from the southeast
	 - Mask programs
	 - Tombs of rulers appear
	 - Jade and spondylus shell become more common
	 - Defensive fortifications appear (increase in warfare)
	 - El Mirador declines around 50-150 CE
 - Classic Period:
	 - Independent states ruled by dynastic kings
	 - Emergence of centralized hierarchical government
	 - Another population boom with majority of the population consisting of non-elites
	 - Emergence of full and part-time specialists
	 - An entrenched social hierarchy
	 - Emergence of a middle class
	 - Emergence of marketplaces and the market economy
	 - Warfare becomes widely common throughout the Maya area
		 - Goals of warfare included taking captives and tribute payments, not territorial expansion

### Mayan City States
 - Never united as a single state
	 - Group of mainly independent city states sharing culture, iconography, religion
 - Competition and warfare was endemic among these centers
 - Every city had sacred core of ceremonial structures, royal palaces, residents (regal-ritual centers)
 - Surrounded by farming villages and hinterland that supported the center
 - Each city-state had its own kings/dynasties, were represented by individual emblem glyphs
 - By 500 CE: 5 regional centers:
	 - Tikal, Calakmul, Palenque, Copan, Caracol
	 - Each ruled over a hitnerland of other smaller centers
 - Mainly unified by religion, used common calendar and hieroglyphic script
 - Endemic warfare between these centers, probably for economic dominance
	 - Warfare ritualistic and highly destructive

### Two Major Dynasties
 - During Early Classic period, we see rise of two major dynasties
	 - Dzibanche: Rise of the Kanu'l (who later move capital to Calakmul)
	 - Tikal: Mutul dynasty
 - During Classic period: Main rivalry in southern Maya Lowlands was between the superpowers of Tikal and Calakmul
	 - Smaller rivalries between dynasties at other sites

### Tikal
 - Early Classic: City of Tikal was one of the largest regional capitals in the southern Maya Lowlands
	 - Located in Peten region of Guatemala
 - Tikal was home of the Mutul Dynasty
 - At peak: Tikal had population of 45-62k people, over 120 sq km
 - Economic powerhouse:
	 - Controlled major trade routes from the Highlands and the Coast
	 - Largely encircled Calakmul and Dzibanche through alliances and trade routes
**Entrada**: (378-550 CE)
 - Very important time in Maya area, see heavy influence coming in from Teotihuacan in Central Highlands of Mexico to the lowland and highland areas
 - During Entrada, we have evidence of dynastic disruption at Tikal
	 - Sihyaj K'ahk: Vassal of warlord named Spearthrower Owl, arrived at Tikal in 378 CE
	 - Coincidentally: Tikal ruler Chak Tok Ich'aak also dies the same day
	 - Sihyaj K'akh installs Yax Nuun Ahiin (son of Spearthrower Owl) on the Tikal throne
 - Tikal is still an economic powerhouse during this time
	 - Still control the major North-South trade route frm the highlands
	 - Restricted Calakmuls access to important resources like obsidian
**Middle/Late Classic Tikal**:
 - During 5th and 6th century conflicts with Kanu'l kings at Dzibanche, Tikal loses control of their important eastern vassals in Caracol and Naranjo
	 - Further allowing the Kanu'l to gain control of those eastern trade routes
 - 562 CE: Tikal defeated by Kanu'l king, Sky Witness, with the help o fthe newly gained ally Caracol
	 - This defeat at the hands of the Kanu'l dissolved the Tikal-Teotihuacan alliance
	 - Defeat greatly diminishes the power of Tikal
 - Tikal is attacked and defeated again in 657 CE by Yuknoom Ch'een (The Great), thus cementing Calakmul and the Kanu'l as the most powerful dynasty in the maya area

### Caracol
**City of Caracol**:
 - Large urban complex found in the Vaca Plateau in Belize
	 - Conservative population estimates: Peak 100k people in contiguous settlement over 200km2
	 - One of largest structures at Caracol: Canna Triadic complex, height of 38 m
	 - Caracol has 55 crved monuments that covered over 450 years of epigraphic records from the site, earliest dating 400 CE
 - Site of Caracol has close to 40 years of archaeological excavations and research
	 - One of the most well known sites in the Maya area
**History of Caracol**:
 - Established during Middle Preclassic at 600 BCE
	 - Similar to other large sites in Maya area, established next to water sources
	 - Location also nearby to local resources such as hard stone and slate
	 - Also located along tarde routes extending from Belize River Valley to the Usumacinta River
 - Early Classic:
	 - Population estimates indicate 30k people lived here
	 - 150 CE: Evidence of rich burial containing 2 figurines, 32 ceramic vessels, mantle of 7k jade & shell beads
		 - Already long distance relationships established in Highlands of Guatemala
		 - Emergence of very early social hierarchy
	 - Royal dynasty at Caracol emerges during Entrada Period
 - Late Classic:
	 - During Late Classic, major economic and urban developments at Caracol
	 - Significant population implies existence of administrative bureaucracy to manage resources
 - Late Classic Infrastructural Expansion
	 - Roads: Major expansion to radial causeway to connect epicenter with several surrounding groups
		 - Eased movement of goods, people, communication
	 - Markets: Multiple markets emerged, most at terminus groups along the causeways
		 - Any resident could reach a market within 5km of their location
	 - Administered Economy: Location of markets were likely primary revenue generators for the state, likely access and transactions were taxed by local elites
 - Abandonments: Last monument at Caracol dates to 884 CE
	 - Following decade appears that Caracol epicenter was completely abandoned

### Palenque
**City of Palenque**:
 - Emergence is largely unknown, evidence at earliest part contains early classic occupation
 - One of the major players in the Usumacinta Region during Classic Period
 - Didn't have as massive of populations as some other Maya Cities
	 - One of the densest urban cores with 1500 structures over 2.2 km2
	 - Archaeologists estimate population was quite small, 6-7.5k at peak
 - Increasing access to important resources such as jade coming into Usumacinta region from highlands of Guatemala
 - Site known for its impressive architectural and water management features
**Temple of the Inscriptions**:
 - One of the most impressive structures at Palenque
	 - Contained secret staircase that housed the burial of one of Palenque's greatest rulers
 - K'inich Janaab' Pakal I, ruled from 615-683 CE
	 - Several victories against other regional capitals in the Usumacinta
		 - War victories in 659 CE, 662 CE, 663 CE, victories recorded on stone panels in Palenque Palace
	 - One of the few Maya Rulers who was octogenarian (died when he was 80)
		 - Buried in temple of the inscriptions
		 - Tomb is one of the greatest works of art ever found in maya region
**Political Geography of Usumacinta**:
 - All regional capitals were constantly vying for power and economic dominance
	 - Lots of epigraphic evidence that shows this tumultuous political geography during Late Classic
 - Capitals of Palenque and Tonina were formidable rivals, several violent exchanges
 - Epigraphic evidence suggests 3 attacks occurred at each capital over 55 years
	 - Palenque successfully attacked Pomona 3 times in 659, 662, 663 CE

### Calakmul
 - One of the largest archaeological sites of the Maya area
	 - Estimated a population of 100k residents at peak
 - The most powerful site in the Maya Lowlands politically and economically during the Late Classic
	 - Formed a regional kingdom under the Kanu'l dynasty
	 - Formed an extensive hegemony between the majority of sites in the Maya Lowlands
 - Two of the largest structures in the region, both greater than 40 meters tall
	 - Both initially constructed during the Late-Preclassic period, had several renovations until the site core was abandoned
 - Had a permanent marketplace in the core of the site, called the Chiik Nahb Complex
	 - Market configuration known as nested marketplace
		 - Evidence of permanent market stalls
	 - Also important due to evidence of murals that depict marketplace activities occurring
**Hegemony of Calakmul: Yuknoom Ch'een "The Great"**
 - Rise of Yuknoom Ch'een ushered in new age for Calakmul and Kanu'l, rise to throne in 636 CE
	 - Yuknoom Ch'een II is likely the ascension name of Yuknoom Head
	 - Rulers Calakmul until his death in 686 CE
	 - Yuknoom Ch'een was considered to be the Emperor of the Lowland Maya from 657-686 CE
 - During his reign, able to expand the hegemony of Calakmul to Naranjo in the east, to El Peru Waka in the west, and to Dos Pilas and Cancuen in the south
	 - Over course of 5 decades, effectively encircled TIkal
**Fall of Calakmul Hegemony**:
 - 695 CE: Yuknoom Yich'aak'kahk' of Calakmul (Son of Yuknoom Ch'een) is defeated by Jasaw Chan K'awiil of Tikal
	 - Defeat recorded on a wooden lentil at a structure at Tikal called Temple I
	 - This initial defeat sends Calakmul on downward trajectory
 - Yik'in Chan K'awiil was instrumental in defeating the Kanu'l hegemony
	 - Defeats two of Calakmul's closest allies
		 - El Peru-Waka in 743 CE and Naranjo in 744 CE
	 - These kingdoms were important as the commanded trade and commerce from the west and east
 - Subjection of Naranjo by Tikal damaged the Kanu'ls access to trade on the eastern corridors to the Caribbean Sea
	 - Had severely severed Calakmul's access to key resources coming up from the coast, Peten, and highlands of Guatemala
 - While Calakmu's hegemony in the Peten was ended by Tikal's victories, Calakmul had shifted its focus to northern neighbours in late 8th century
	 - Also evidence from Oxpemul (secondary center under Calakmul state) attacks and defeats a Kamnu'l king in 751 CE

### Maya Collapse
**Symptoms**:
 - Abandonment of palaces and temples at larger regional centers
 - Cessation of monumental architecture and public sculptures at most sites
 - Decline in carved hieroglyphic texts
 - Reduction in elite goods production
 - Significant decline in hinterland populations
 - Significant movement of populations to surrounding areas
	 - Highlands, Northern Lowlands, Chiapas, etc
 - Overall: Not a total collapse of the Maya population, but an institutional collapse where we see these larger elite sponsored institutions breaking down and ceasing to exist in the area
**Reasons for the Collapse**:
 - Overpopulation and environmental degradation
	 - End of 8th century: Population beyond the carrying capacity of the land
	 - Led to increased deforestation -> soil erosion
 - Drought
	 - Evidence of drought taken from sediment cores from bottom of water sources
		 - Ratios of oxygen-18 isotope give indications of climatic conditions
	 - Period between 800-1050 CE: Driest period over 3500 years
 - Warfare
	 - As Calakmul and Tikal started to lose control of their vassal city-states, smaller conflicts followed throughout all regions of the Maya area
