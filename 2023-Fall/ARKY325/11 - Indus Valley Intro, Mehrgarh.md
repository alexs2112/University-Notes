### South Asia
 - Geographically defined by major barriers
	 - Sort of circumscribed
 - Himalayas and Hindu Kush to the north and northwest
	 - Massive chain of mountains with passes and gorges to access Afghanistan, Tibet, Central Asia, Arabian Peninsula
 - Thar (Great Indian) Desert to the east
 - Tropical forest further to the east
 - Physical barriers created distinct civilization with mixed cultures, languages, religions
**Background**:
 - Climate for region stabilized around 8000 BCE
 - Monsoons: May to September and December to March bring rains for agriculture
 - Monsoons fluctuate over time
	 - During Indus civilization, the climate was generally wetter

### Indus Valley
 - Indus floods between June and September
	 - Settlements were built above the highest flood level
 - The floodplain is a desert environment, farmers built a system of irrigation canals to water their fields
 - Unlike the Nile & Euphrates rivers, the Indus River has a major system of tributaries
	 - Settlements were spread out along the rivers and tributaries
 - Sarasvati River (Ghaggar-Hakra) was another ancient river that disappeared 4000 BCE
 - The floodplain has no minerals or metals (need to trade with surrounding mountain area)
	 - More forested in the past, has sources of clay and rich agriculture
**Discovery**:
 - Harappan Civilization was not widely known until the 20th century
 - 1856 British Engineers were building part of the East India Railroad through the Punjab and needed ballast (material to support the train tracks)
 - Looted burnt mudbrick from Harappan sites to use for ballast (Harappa, Mohenjo-daro)
 - Harappan seals were found in 1912, suggesting early date for the sites
 - Excavated in the 1920s by ASI archaeologists
	 - Sir John Hubert Marshall, Rai Bahadur Daya Ram Sahni, Madho Sarup Vats
**Harappan Civilization**:
 - Harappan Civilization emerges in the Indus Valley of Pakistan and India
 - Indus River source is in Tibet in the Himalayas then descends onto the semiarid Indus plain
	 - The Indus River lays down rich silt in the annual floods (keeps the lands fertile)
 - Hot dry summers, cold winters
 - Farmers depended on seasonal rivers and streams for irrigation
 - Annual flooding has buried some sites with more than 10m of silt

### Neolithic: Early Farmers
 - 7000 BCE
**Early Food Production**:
 - Many ecological regions in the Indus Valley
 - Main domesticated plants and animals in the Indus Valley were likely introduced from the Middle East, East Asia, Africa
	 - Local barley and cotton domesticates
 - One exception is zebu (humped) cattle
	 - Domesticated in South Asia from local wild aurochs
 - After 5500 BCE, people in this area used pottery vessels, highly mobile pastoralists
 - During Chalcolithic Period (4300 BCE) settlements increased in number and size

### Mehrgarh
 - 7000-2600 BCE
 - Mehrgarh (in modern state of Pakistan) is the earliest Neolithic site in the northwest Indian subcontinent
 - Site is important because it is located near the Bolan Pass in Balochistan, trade route between the Indus Valley and what is now Afghanistan
 - Wheat, barley, sheep, goat, domesticated local zebu cattle
	 - Eventually added chickpea, lentil, sesame
 - Within 1000 years, people lived in substantial mud-brick houses with 4 internal divisions laid out in a defined orientation
 - Worked local copper ore
 - People were buried in brick-lined tombs with bitumen-lined baskets
	 - Absence of pottery
	 - Also buried with bone & stone tools, bangles, turquoise & shell beads, ornaments of lapis lazuli, limestone, sandstone
 - Oldest known lost-wax technique for casting copper in form of a wheel-shaped amulet
 - Some animal sacrifices (mainly goats)
**6000-5500 BCE**:
 - Pottery introduced
 - Zebu are domesticated
 - Possibly earliest evidence of cotton in the world
 - Figurines of females and animals (oldest figurines in South Asia) placed in graves
**Dentistry**:
 - Proto-dentistry
 - Evidence that bead making skills were used on nine individual's teeth (molars)
 - Archaeologists found 11 molars in skeletons in the cemetery that showed clear drilling marks
	 - No filling
	 - Individuals survived as there were wear marks over the drilling marks
	 - Probably used flint drill bit (used in beads)
**Mehrgarh Surplus & Craft**:
 - Archaeologists have found communal buildings for grain storage
 - Crafts include faience beads, more detailed female figurines, first button seals
 - Updraft kilns & large pit kilns for pottery
 - After 3500 BCE, community broke up into small densely packed units connected by irrigation canals
 - Site was abandoned by 2600 BCE when major Harappan cities emerged
