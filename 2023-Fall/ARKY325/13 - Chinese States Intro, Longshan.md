### Timeline: Huanghe and Yangtze Rivers, China
 - Politically complex states developed in several regions of China during the Neolithic
	 - We begin to see symbols that are precursors to later Chinese writing systems
 - Multiple regions were economically diverse, founded on different domesticated crops

### China
**Setting**:
 - Vast area with significant variation in its physical geography
 - Areas we will look at are two major river valleys:
	 - Huanghe (Yellow) River in the north
	 - Yangtze River in the south
 - Both river valleys have evidence for the origins of agriculture and early state development
**Early Neolithic Villages**:
 - 7000-4500 BCE
 - Development of civilizations in China was largely indigenous (not population movement)
 - North China (Cishan/Peiligang)
	 - Small agricultural villages comprised of pithouses (semi-subterranean structure) and large storage structures
	 - Ceramic vessels, grindstones, stone tools
	 - Bones of dogs, pigs, chickens
	 - Millet
 - South China (Hemedu)
	 - Large, dispersed villages comprised of plank houses set on stilts
	 - Ceramic vessels, bone tools
	 - Bones of dogs, pigs, water buffalo
	 - Rice
### The North: Huanghe River Valley
 - Huanghe (Yellow) River is the 2nd longest in China (5464 km)
 - Flows through a region of loess soil deposited in the last ice age by glacial winds
	 - These are dry and permeable soils
 - Region had cold winters
	 - Early agriculture in this region based in drought resistant millet farming
 - Substantial flooding risk prior to modern damming efforts
	 - Floods could change the course of the river by hundreds of kilometers
**Peiligang Culture** (7000-5000 BCE):
 - The earliest known Neolithic culture in the Huanghe River valley
 - Farmers had domesticated broomcorn, foxtail millets and Chinese cabbage
	 - Foxtail millet probably domesticated 10kya
 - Peiligang sites also have bones of domesticated pigs, dogs, fowl, and collected wild animals/plant foods
	 - Continued hunting, fishing, gathering as important part of diet
 - Ceramic vessels, grinding stones, and stone tools
**Yangshao Culture** (5000-3000 BCE):
 - Develops from the Peiligang culture
 - Farmed foxtail millet, Chinese cabbage, silk, hemp, chestnuts, domesticated soybean
	 - Domesticated pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, dogs
 - Spatially planned communities
 - One village: Banpo with 100 houses, surrounded by ditch, with cemetery and pottry kilns outside the ditch
**Case Study: Ban-po-ts'un**:
 - 5000 BCE
 - Evidence of millet, hemp, silk (spindle whorls)
 - 5-7 ha (12-17 ac), up to 100 residences, enclosed by ditch (defense/draining)
	 - Fire pits, animal pens, storage bins
	 - Pottery kilns
 - End of sites occupation (3000 BCE):
	 - Large, non-residential strutctures
	 - Elaborate child burials
		 - Emergence of social inequality
		 - Power passed through family system, not based on achieved status
**Jiangzhai Village**:
 - 15 km east of Banpo, contemporaneous occupation
 - Largest and most complete Neolithic village in Yellow River basin
 - Village divided into extended family or lineage based sectors
	 - Some had greater agricultural surpluses than others
		 - Based on size of associated storage pits
 - Early cemetery with three distinct setions (primary, urn burials)
	 - Later cemetery with collective, secondary burials
 - 3000 skeletons excavated from site, all indicate agricultural subsistence
 - Oldest copper artifacts found in China
**Yangshao Pottery**:
 - Yangshao is onsidered to be the roots of Chinese culture
 - They produced decorated pottery
 - Cooking vessels included steaming pots
	 - Considered as evidence for the beginning of Chinese cuisine
 - Signs or marks on Yangshao pots
	 - Not viewed as a language, might be maker's marks

### The South: The Yangtze River Valley
 - Longest river in China (6300 km) and third longest in the world
 - The Yangtze River area is warmer, better watered with milder winters and hot summers
 - In this area, rice was cultivated in waterlogged fields
 - Asian rice was domesticated in the middle Yangtze (9500 BCE)
 - Several early Neolithic groups in this area but the most important evidence comes from the site of Hemudu
**Hemudu (or Ho-mu-tu)** (5000 BCE):
 - Hemudu were a cultural group that occupied an area south of the Yangtze River Delta
	 - Co-existed with the Majaibang culture slightly to the north
 - Hemudu people lived in long stilt houses
	 - Communal longhouses were also common in Hemudu sites
 - Most of the artifacts discovered at Hemudu consist of animal bones
	 - Exemplified by hoes made of scapulae used for cultivating rice
 - Likely domesticated pigs, but practiced extensive hunting of deer and some wild water buffalo
	 - Fishing also carried out on a large scale
 - Named after a wet site with excellent preservation. Anaerobic conditions preserved stilt footprints, wooden and bone artifacts, other organic materials
 - Recovered a thick layer of rice from a collapsed granary, also water chestnuts, bottle gourds, acorns, sour jujubes, wild rice
 - Evidence of rice-paddy cultivation
	 - One of the earliest groups to cultivate rice
 - Also flutes and a red-lacquered wooden bowl
 - Produced a porous, thick black pottery made with charcoal powder

### Middle and Late Neolithic
 - Multiple centers of complexity emerging
 - By 3500 BCE, farming spread throughout many parts of China
 - Societies were becoming more complex and hierarchical in organization
 - Separate centers of complexity:
	 - Lower Yangtze Valley (Liangzhu)
	 - Manchuria in Northeast (Hongshan)
	 - Huanghe Basin (Longshan)
	 - Western/Sichuan (Sanxingdui)
**Yangtze River Delta: Liangzhu Culture** (3300-2200 BCE):
 - Early evidence of social hierarchy found in the Yangtze River Delta at Sidun
 - Burial of individual under 20m high mound
	 - Individual surrounded by 109 jade objects, including bi and cong
		 - In historic times: bi=heaven, cong=earth, unclear what it meant or how it was used in ancient times
		 - These were important items, often placed near stomach or chest
	 - Had enough status to demand labour from other members of the community
**Liangzhu Jades**:
 - Jades carry motifs similar to Taotie designs found on later Shang bronzes
 - Bi and cong also spread to other parts of China
	 - Indicates extend of Liangzhu influence
 - Liangzhu was likely a powerful chiefdom or proto-state
 - Located outside of the Huanghe Basin but elements of this culture are found in the later Shang state
**Manchuria: Hongshan Culture**:
 - 4000-3000 BCE
 - Small scattered villages with ceremonial sites and elaborate burials
 - Associated with fragments of clay statues, some life-size or larger
 - Niuheliang Temple: Completes life-sized clay female head, jade eyes found in cruciform structure 25m long, with semi-subterranean chambers
 - Hongshan is a proto-state

### Huanghe River Valley: Longshan Culture
 - 2700-2000 BCE
 - Northern China: Longshan (Lungshan) follows the Yangshao
 - Clear evidence of social ranking, unequal distribution of wealth, increased violence (fortified cities/skeletons with trauma)
 - Increased political complexity
 - Craft specialization in pottery, copper/bronze, and jade
 - Larger villages with tamped-earth walls
 - Many elements of Longshan are precursors to the Shang state
**Political Complexity**:
 - Interaction sphere of many independent polities
 - Interaction spheres stimulate spread of technology, shared ideology represented in shared material symbols
 - With time, material culture becomes more homogenous
 - Different polities may unite into a state
**Pottery and Ritual**:
 - Pedestal bowls (tou) and cooking pots (ting)
	 - Solid and hollow legs
 - Ceramics are highly burnished, wheel-made, thin walled (eggshell) black wares
 - Fired at 1200 celsius
 - Longshan are also called the "black pottery culture"
 - Finely made black wares were used as elite grave goods
	 - Forerunners of the Shang bronzes
**Communities**:
 - Defensive rectangular walled communities
 - Construction technique called *hang tu* (rammed earth)
	 - Rammed earth walls were up to 10 meters thick, several meters high
 - Spread layer upon layer of loess soil and pounded it with wooden poles
 - Defensive structures had guardhouses of sun dried brick at the entrance
 - Unclear if rammed earth enclosures are evidence for an early state
	 - They required organized workforce to construct
 - Inside the walls had craft areas and houses
 - Later in Longshan, settlements have rammed earth platforms that might be foundations for palaces/elite residences
 - Human sacrifices were found in the foundations
**Burials**:
 - Stratified social classes (high, medium, low with further stratification within each of these classes)
 - Highest status: wooden coffins, jade ornaments, ceremonial weapons, fine pottery
 - Evidence of widespread violence
 - At *Ch'enh tzu-yai* (Jiangou): 6 individuals in one house scalped, many men, women, children decapitated and thrown down a well
**Scapulimancy**:
 - Ritual practice to predict the future
 - In Shang times, questions were posed to the deities and ancestors
 - Written on the shoulder blade of an ox or on a turtle shell
 - Hot metal rod is applied
 - Pattern of cracking determined the answers to the questions
	 - Answers also recorded on the bone/shell in Shang times
 - No inscriptions on Longshan oracle bones - just cracking
**Taosi**:
 - Most important Longshan site
 - 280 hectares enclosed with rammed earth wall
 - Elite residences are separated from commoners by dividing walls
 - Taosi had a 3-tiered class system and a 3-tiered settlement hierarchy
 - Abandoned at the end of the third millenium BCE (as were others)
 - Archaeology indicates that the Longshan was a period of warring elites
 - During this period: Shift in ritual vessels from pottery to copper or bronze
 - Prefigures the Shang state
