### Shang Society
 - Rigid classes, sumptuary laws (eg who could own bronzes)
 - King was divine ruler with absolute power
	 - Only king could interact with ancestors on behalf of people
 - Feudal tributary system for taxes, labour, militia
 - Taxes paid by lower classes to upper classes who lived lavish lifestyle
**Shang Court and Tian**:
 - Court on earth was organized as a mirror of the god world (Heaven or "tian")
	 - Tian translates as sky, day, transcendent deity
 - Celestial pole at center of heaven (*axis mundi*)
	 - Universe revolves around this pole
 - Lord on High (*Shang-di*) lives at center of tian where he commands nature and all of the ranked subordinate supernatural entities just as the Shang king did from his palace
**Shang King**:
 - Earthly representative of Shang-di
 - King's role was to please Shang-di and the forces of nature through regular sacrifices of wine and grain in bronze vessels
 - Work, wars, all sacrifices were timed with changes of seasons and celestial movements
 - If Shang-di was not pleased, harvests would fail
	 - Unusual events (meteor showers, eclipses) were signs of Shang-di's displeasure
 - Palace was center of the state (axis mundi)
**Written Records of the State**:
 - Written records also record aspects of history/society
 - Before Shang Dynasty, there were ~750 independent fortified city states
 - Some shared common culture
	 - Referred to as ethnic groups
 - These states were not unified until Qin Dynasty (221 BCE)
**Shang Bronzes**:
 - Hallmark of Shang is its bronze vessels
	 - Peak of bronze casting
 - Ritual bronze vessels for preparing grain-based drink and food (never meat) as offerings to the royal ancestors
 - Death of a royal elite involved ritual feasting for the royal ancestor spirits
	 - Ritual bronzes were then placed in the deceased's tomb
	 - Feasting only for royal burials
	 - Only royal dead became spirits
 - Bronzes replace the earlier Longshan pottery forms placed in the grave
 - **Production of Bronzes**:
	 - Ceramic piece molds that fit tightly together
	 - Large workshops attached to the palace
		 - Involved several specialists
	 - More decorated, the more valuable (style indicated status)
	 - King distributed bronze to aristocrats for weapons, chariots, vessels
		 - Bronze weapons found in chariot burials
 - Taotie masks in foreground, spirals in background
	 - Taotie translates to ravenous hunger, not sure what it meant here
		 - Used to serve food to the ancestors
	 - Mythical beast? Ancestor Spirits?
 - Ritual Bronze vessels were large, thick, and numerous
	 - Medium used to interact with ancestors
 - Took a large quantity of bronze out of circulation
 - Bronze controlled by king and only produced in palace precinct
 - Vessels in tombs represent command over valuable commodity, labour, surplus, ritual authority
**Symmetry**:
 - Shang had an appreciation of symmetry (order and harmony)
 - Tombs and temples were square or oblong, oriented to cardinal directions
 - Bronzes were symmetrical
 - Inscribed messages on bronzes and tortoise shells were repeated on right and left sides
 - World perceived as square, wind blew from 4 quarters
 - 4 groups of foreigners lived on their borders ("barbarians", didn't practice similar culture)
 - Literature, art, architecture in elements of other symmetrical arrangements
**Vessel Typology**:
 - Strict typology for food and wine vessels by shape that were used for specific ritual functions
 - Owning these vessels was a key criteria for claiming and maintaining elite status
	 - Strict sumptuary laws of who could own which types of vessels
 - By Zhou times, cooking cauldron (ting) was symbol of the state
	 - Ownership of ting was essential to maintain kingly status
**Chinese Cuisine**:
 - Cuisine is closely tied to social identity
 - 4000 year old millet noodles recovered from sealed earthenware bowl
 - Oracle bones in Shang times recorded details of how food was to be prepared and cooked
 - Barbarians were those who did not know how to prepare and consume food in the customary manner
**Shang in Context**:
 - Influential and powerful, but not alone
 - Archaeologists now view the Bronze Age and state formation in China as multi-centered
	 - With Shang as only one of its players

### Other Bronze-Working Polities
**Sanxingdui: Kingdom of Shu**:
 - Early city with defensive rammed earth wall and buildings
 - 2 sacrificial pits filled with bronzes, ivory, jades
 - Objects in 2 categories:
	 - Bronze ritual vessels & other objects in Shang style
	 - Locally produced objects with an emphasis on the human form
 - The importation of Shang bronze ritual vessels in other states indicates the wide esteem held of the Shang by other rulers
**Xin'gan Tomb, Jiangxi Province**:
 - Site south of Yangtze River
 - Tomb is second richest Bronze Age tomb (next to Fu Hao's tomb) (1400 BCE)
 - 356 pottery vessels, 50 bronze vessels, 4 bronze bells, 400 bronze weapons and tools, 150 jades
	 - Some of the bronzes have taotie masks similar to Shang bronzes, others are in a local style
 - Probably part of the regional state of Wecheng

### End of Shang
 - 1046 BCE
 - Shang rulers overthrown by vassal from Wei River valley called Wu Wang
 - Wu Wang establishes the Western Zhou dynasty (1027-771 BCE)
 - Zhou state still feudal but with increased bureaucratization and the rise of ministerial families
 - Increased size of walled cities
	 - Largest of the Zhou cities: G'a-to, population of 270k people
	 - With increased population, lineage ties broke down and bureaucracies based on taxes became stronger

### Summary
 - Origins of agriculture in river valleys is often productive enough to support urban living
 - Floodplains are rich in soil but poor in other materials that need to be obtained through exchange
 - Agricultural surplus, exchange, and the production of specialized craft all fall under a bureaucracy in large populations
 - While initially villages seem peaceful, elites eventually conquer others
	 - Is this to acquire more land or control trade routes?
 - All of these early states have common elements but not necessarily a similar pathway to statehood
