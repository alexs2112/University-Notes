 - Written in first person (king) as the voice of justice for all, even widows and orphans
 - Monetary fines to compensate for bodily injury
	 - Capital punishment for murder, robbery, adultery, rape (punishment graded by class)
 - Basis of later law codes include that of Hammurabi

 - Little later in time
 - Law code very similar to that of Ur, but more detailed
 - Penalties for perjury, robbery, murder
