### Early Dynastic/Archaic Period
 - 3100-2700 BCE
 - Major elements of dynastic kingship become well-developed in this period
**Role of the King**:
 - Early rulers came from Upper Egypt (Thinite dynasty)
 - Kings were responsible for mediating between forces of order and chaos
 - Concept of *Ma'at* (order, justice, moral righteousness) vs *Isfet* (disorder)
 - Creator god (Ra) instituted ma'at at the beginning of time
	 - Passed it down to each king
 - King was earthly manifestation of the Creator god and returned to the Creator god after death
**Burial Practices of Early Dynastic Kings**:
 - Abydos remained sacred burial place of Dynastic kings
 - Kings were buried in *mastabas* (low mud-brick structures)
 - Burial chamber cut beneath mud-brick structure that was entered by staircase
 - Chapel in upper structure for offerings
 - Queens and retainers were buried around the king in simple pit graves
 - Earliest evidence of boat burials is at Abydos
	 - Moored with a stone
**Human Sacrifice**:
 - Occurred during the Early Dynastic
	 - Human sacrifice ended about 2700 BCE, before the Old Kingdom period
 - Human sacrifices likely were intended to serve king in afterlife
 - Replaced by *shabtis*
	 - Figures who magically came to life in afterworld and served the dead ruler
	 - Made from different materials (stone, clay, faience, wood)
**Religious Ideology**:
 - Kings created cult centers to the gods to link themselves to all local deities (hundreds of gods)
 - Forged a national religion represented in a standardized art style that lasts for 3000 years
 - King identified with Horus and with sun god Ra (top deity)
 - Ra sailed across the sky during the day in the day-barque
	 - Stepped onto night-barque at sunset to fight the forces of chaos
	 - Metaphor of the cyclical process of death and rebirth, flooding of the Nile, how night and day recur
**Afterlife: Ba and Ka**:
 - *Ba* is a person's spirit that can leave the body, roam around, still needs the body to return to
 - *Ka* is the life force that needs to be nourished
	 - eg. at feasting tables painted in tombs
 - Essential to preserve the body
 - Initially: Afterlife only available to rulers and their entourage
**Mummification increasingly refined**:
 - Increased development of mummification over time
 - Removed organs, dried body with salt (natron), perfumed body with resin/milk/incense, then wrapped in linen with protective amulets
 - Specialist practice, process took up to 70 days
**Pyramid Texts and the Book of the Dead**:
 - Book of the Dead used in the New Kingdom, based in the Pyramid Texts (some of the same spells)

 - Redistributed resources to loyal officials, rations to workers and bureaucrats
 - Bureaucracy requires writing
	 - Class of scribes important and high status
	 - Paper invented in Egypt
**Egyptian Writing and Notation**:
 - Hieroglyphic writing deciphered by Jean-Francois Champollion (1822) using Rosetta Stone
	 - Translates between Ancient Greek, Hieroglyphics, Hieratic/Demotic
