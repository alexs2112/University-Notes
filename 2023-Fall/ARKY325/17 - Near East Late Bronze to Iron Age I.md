### Iron Age
 - 1200 BCE
**Iron**:
 - Iron is one of the most complex technologies of the ancient world
 - Iron ore is widely available
	 - Cheaper than bronze, can be used for everyday items
 - Requires higher temperatures and control of oxygen in the furnace atmosphere
	 - Once metal is extracted from ore it is heated and pounded into shape in the forge
 - Developed in 3rd millennium BCE, complexity of process slowed its spread
 - Iron is widespread in Aegean and parts of Near East in 11th century CE
 - Iron also developed by city states in Syria, Anatolia, Assyrians east of Euphrates
**Mediterranean Coast**: (1000-700 BCE)
 - Phoenicians and Israelites were leading Levantine powers in this period

 - Most important city-states were Tyre, Sidon
 - Renowned as craftspeople

**Alphabet**:
 - One of the most significant inventions of the Near East
