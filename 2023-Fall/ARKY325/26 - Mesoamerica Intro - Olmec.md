### Mesoamerica
 - 2 major cultural areas:
	 - The Central Highlands (including Oaxaca & the Valley of Mexico)
	 - The Maya area (plus the Gulf Coast)
 - Great environmental diversity
	 - Resources needed by everyone were confined to restricted areas
	 - No area was self-sufficient, trade and exchange were always very important
 - Important resources:
	 - Knapping stone: Obsidian, some chert
	 - Grinding stones: Basalt
	 - Semi-precious stone: Jade, Turquoise, etc
	 - Metals (in post-Classic times)
	 - Textiles
	 - Ritual: Incense, feathers, stingray spines
	 - Salt
**Agriculture**:
 - Major domesticates:
	 - American Triumvirate: Domesticated maize, beans, and squash
	 - Provides a complete protein diet
	 - Domesticated in the Formative period (American Neolithic) between 10-7 kya
 - 4 centers for agricultural base:
	 - Mesoamerica
	 - Highland South America
	 - Eastern North America
	 - Amazon Basin
 - Origins in Mesoamerica:
	 - R.S. MacNeish (1960s)
	 - Tehuacan Valley Project to study plant domestication in Mesoamerica
		 - Puebla, Mexican Highlands, an ecologically varied area
**Tehuacan Valley**:
 - 450 sites, 12 are deeply stratified, containing dry caves (preserved) & open air sites
	 - From 10k BCE to 1500 CE, dated by radiocarbon dates
 - 10k plant remains, 11k animal remains
	 - Diet composed of meat, wild vegetables, cultivated plants
**Rise of Complexity**:
 - Develops in several different places
	 - Valley of Mexico
	 - Gulf Coast
	 - Mayan lowlands
	 - Oaxaca Valley
	 - Soconusco (Pacific Coast)
 - Vastly different environments, civilizations linked in trade and exchange of ideas

### Gulf Coast: The Olmec
 - 2 major centers:
	 - San Lorenzo: (1150-800 BCE)
	 - La Venta: (900-400 BCE)
**Mesoamerican State Characterization**:
 - Rituals, blood sacrifice (stingray/other fish spines and seashells)
 - Stepped pyramids with other monuments (ball courts, temples, stelae)
 - Calendar and writing systems
 - Styles of dress
 - Market economy
 - Development of these civilizations occur simultaneously in these areas through trade and other interactions
**Pre-Classic Gulf Coast: Olmec 1500-400 BCE**:
 - Olmec means "rubber people", a name that comes from the Aztecs
 - Rich uplands, estuaries, floodplains
	 - Rivers flood annually, depositing alluvium for agriculture
 - Fish, crocodiles, toads, birds, domesticated dogs
 - Maize, beans, squash, manioc, chili peppers, sunflower, beans, chocolate
**Olmec**:
 - Origin of the Olmec is unclear
	 - Likely local lineages held land, some had more land than others and became powerful
	 - Built locations to express power in ritual performances
 - Elite interaction evident in exchange between highlands and gulf coast
	 - Trade consisting of obsidian, jade, magnetite, shell, stingray spines, shark teeth
	 - Also exchange of symbols, architecture, and rituals
 - Not a state but a series of chiefdoms
 - Olmec were involved in trade well beyond Olmec heartland
	 - Trade resulted in widespread sharing of art motifs, religious symbols, ritual practices & concepts of kingship
	 - Olmec is a catalyst for the movement of these ideas (but ideas developing in many places)
 - Also constructed monumental platforms
	 - Pyramids
	 - Basalt carvings of statues, altars, stelae
	 - Developed symbolism of kingship
**Ball Courts**:
 - Found in all Mesoamerican complex societies 
	 - They are present in Olmec times
 - Court of earth and clay enclosed by ridges or sloped walls
 - Lots of ritual elements involved in these games
**Basalt Heads**:
 - Wearing a helmet
 - 3m tall, 20 tons
 - Stone quarried up to 100 km away from Olmec centers
	 - Organization of labour
 - Probably portraits of rulers
	 - Glyphs on heads may be their names
**Basalt Altars (Thrones)**:
 - Large rectangular stone blocks, flat topped, carved in low relief
 - Once painted in bright colours
 - Symbols of authority
**Stela (Stelae)**:
 - Pillars of stone carved in low relief
	 - Designs in human and animal forms
	 - Often include hieroglyphics of the dates when the stelae were constructed (post-Olmec)
 - Used in many cultures, usually associated with elite authority
**Olmec Concept of Kingship**:
 - Concept of kingship comes from the Olmec
	 - First in Mesoamerica to portray their power in art forms
 - Rulers were seated on sculpted thrones with complex symbolism of power
 - Shamanic images of elite with images of the cult of the serpent (possibly feathered serpent)
 - Planned ceremonial architecture found in elite centers to legitimate their rule
**Jaguar Symbolism**:
 - Olmec rulers were associated with were-jaguar imagery
 - Origin myth of kingship: were-jaguar is the product of the mating of human woman and jaguar
	 - Baby is part human, part jaguar: snarling mouth, flaming eyebrows, cleft head
	 - Kingship originates in were-jaguar myth
	 - New rulers were shaman-kings with supernatural powers
 - Jaguars move in water, on land, in trees
	 - Long associated with rain, fertility, and shamanic power
	 - Like jaguar, shaman moves between worlds of the dead, the living, and the deities
 - Shamanic rituals involved blood-letting and human sacrifices
	 - Key rituals to Mesoamerican civilizations
**Pyrite Mirrors**:
 - Highly polished pyrite, magnetite, ilmenite
 - Symbols of high status

	 - Cascajal block found near San Lorenzo (900 BCE)

	 - Found in 2006, recovered from a mining operation
**La Venta**: (900-400 BCE)

 - Linear complex, 1.6km long of clay and earthen pyramids + plazas
