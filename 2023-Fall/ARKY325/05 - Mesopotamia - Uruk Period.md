### Uruk Revolution (4200-3100 BCE)
 - 4th millennium civilizations
 - First urban centers and city states emerge
 - Writing
 - Wheeled vehicles
 - Craft specialization
 - Centralized religious and secular control
 - Expansion of trading networks
 - Clear evidence of social hierarchy
**Tells**:
 - Artificial mounds on the plain
	 - The remains of Mesopotamian cities, generations of settlement and architectural constructions
 - Created by the build-up and collapse of mud-brick buildings and rubbish of city dwellers over time
 - Many became stranded in desert as rivers changed their course

### Uruk (Warka)
 - Development of first true urban centers (central places) with full time bureaucracy, military, social hierarchy
 - Uruk is the world's first true city
	 - Largest in Uruk Period, 40-80k people at peak
 - 4-tiered settlement hierarchy (cities, towns, villages, hamlets)
 - Massive increase in number of settlements after 4000 BCE
**Settlement Excavations**:
 - Most excavations of elite architecture
 - Cities appear to have developed unplanned
	 - Temple/palaces at core that is surrounded by crowded narrow streets packed with rectangular houses of whitewashed mud bricks
 - Possibly 2 settlements merged that were centered around White Temple and Eanna Precinct
 - Smaller satellite towns up to 10km away with canal systems
	 - Provided food to support cities
### Uruk's White Temple and Anu Ziggurat
 - Dedicated to main god Anu (sky god)
 - Eanna Precinct: Courtyards, structures, terraces, temple platform dedicated to Inanna/Ishtar
 - Increasing separation of general populace and temple administration
	 - Walls around their residences, higher platforms
 - Increasing amounts of labour to build structures
**White Temple**:
 - Built of limestone (locally available) with mud-brick base
 - Like other mud brick temples, White Temple was decorated with cone mosaics
	 - Cones of different colours of clay
 - Earliest evidence of cuneiform writing from Eanna Precinct
**Anu Ziggurat**:
 - Temple construction becomes more monumental
 - Ziggurats are stepped platform pyramids, presumably with temples on top
 - Required large amounts of labour and materials
	 - 80k person days
 - Requires centralized authority to construct
 - Power of authority reflected in size of ziggurat
**Temples and Ziggurats**:
 - Visible over long distances on the floodplain (up to 10m tall)
 - Possibly represent mountains or stairways for gods to descend to earth, or to ascend to heaven
 - Temples were a place where deities lived and held court
 - Temples, store houses, houses of prominent families on top

### Secular Rulers
 - New authorities
 - Clear evidence of government organization in Uruk Period
	 - Organization now includes secular rulers (*Ensi* - Lord of the Plowland)
 - Images of men subduing enemies, taking prisoners
 - Male individual (long hair, beard, net skirt) possibly ruler
	 - Most imagery is of men (politics possibly dominated by men)
 - Secular leaders ruled by charismatic power or military prowess
 - Commanded tribute in labour and surplus production
 - Responsible for providing offerings to city's gods/goddesses
	 - Mesopotamians believed god-world was a mirror of the living world
	 - Patron god defended their city in council of gods
	 - Rulers made offerings to the patron god to keep them happy

### Cult Deities
 - Sumerian written records indicate images of gods
	 - Made from wood, covered in gold
	 - None of these remain today
 - Gods actually dwelled in these images, these were brought out for festivities
	 - Carried through communities
**Priests**:
 - Divine future through dreams and reading entrails of sacrificed animals
 - Records kept of sacrifices, divinations, and the events that followed
 - Secular rulers held in check by priests who could usurp their power
**Other Authorities**:
 - Early texts indicate that local kin groups (clans) also were large land holders
 - By late Uruk times, clan leaders were selling and purchasing land
 - Rare excavation of Uruk non-elite structures at *Abu Salabikh* shows that people were living in extended family units (20 people) in large houses)

### Secular Architecture
 - Temples and palaces built on top of high mud-brick platforms
 - Spatial separation of palace from temple infers separation of secular and religious power
 - Unlike large Ubaid towns, Uruk period cities are surrounded by walls up to 15m thick
	 - Built of kiln-fired mud brick (symbol of power and wealth)

### Uruk Economy
 - City and satellites linked together in network of interdependence
 - Each center specialized in goods for trade with other cities
 - Craft production increasingly under administrative control
	 - More efficient movement of raw materials and products
 - Goods moved by donkey caravans and by boat on the rivers
**Long Distance Exchange**:
 - Increased craft specialization is marker of increasing complexity
 - Huge expansion of long-distance trade to obtain materials for luxury items (lapis lazuli, onyx, gold, carnelian, silver, alabaster, copper, etc)
 - Uruk traded grain and some pottery for these goods
**Copper**:
 - First appears in 3500 BCE, widespread by 3000 BCE
 - Tools for agriculture and warfare
**Innovations**:
 - Potter's slow wheel (3500 BCE) & molds to increase volume of production
	 - Undecorated utilitarian wares
 - Bevel-rimmed bowls (ration bowls) to feed labourers
	 - Huge numbers indicates scale of centralized labour
 - Probably bread baking molds

### Importance of Writing
**Administration**: 
 - Important tool of bureaucracy
 - Documentation of events and transactions
 - Promotes efficient management of trade, taxation collection, political control
 - By Sumerian times, it was used to write poetry and histories
**Evolution of Writing - Stage 1**:
 - Notation systems begin in Neolithic (7000 BCE)
	 - Baked clay tokens in 16 shapes (spheres, pyramids, cubes, animals, pottery jars)
	 - Different sizes denote quantities, shape represents different commodities
 - Found in Neolithic sites from Turkey to Pakistan
 - 3D shapes correspond to 2D ideographs/signs on later clay tablets
 - 6000 years ago, explodes to 300 forms with markings for more detailed records
**Evolution of Writing - Stage 2, Bullae**:
 - After 3500 BCE: Many tokens encased in clay bullae (balls)
 - Bullae are impressed with outline of tokens before sealed
	 - If shape doesn't impress well, they were incised
 - X-rays show content of bullae do not always correspond with impressions
 - Probably represent single transaction
**Evolution of Writing - Stage 3, Tablets**:
 - 3000-2000 BCE: Shift to tablets
	 - Easier to handle
 - 80% of tablets from Uruk were economic in nature, lists of professions
 - Early inscriptions were in shape of earlier tokens
	 - Later signs were for language sounds (syllabic)
 - Gradually replaced by stylized writing called cuneiform (~3100 BCE)

### Cuneiform
 - From Latin, *cuneus* meaning wedge shaped
 - Wedge-shaped tool used to make symbols (simple stylus)
 - Written left to right, eventually signs turned 90 degrees (to avoid smudging?)
 - Scribes were highly trained professionals, occupation often ran in families
	 - Most people were illiterate
	 - Scribes were usually men, not always
		 - Enheduanna, daughter of King Sargon, was a famous author of hymns and laments
 - Highly efficient form of record keeping (standardized)
 - Used for 3000 years (until 1st century CE)
 - 600-700 signs (complicated) of sounds and ideographs
 - Used to write different languages (Sumerian, Akkadian, Semitic)

### Cylinder Seals
 - Developed in Uruk times
 - Pressed into clay lumps to seal cargo for trade
 - Seals used by person in authority to witness trade transaction
 - Loss of seal was like losing a credit card
	 - Had to be announced in town to prevent owner from accruing debts of thieves

### Other Achievements
 - Systems of measurement, mathematics, astronomy
 - Sexagesimal system (based on 60) still used in the West to measure time and degrees in a circle
**Plough and Wheel**:
 - Increased production on alluvium with plough and oxen
 - Wheeled vehicles important for transporting goods and in warfare
 - Warfare increased in Uruk period (fortified villages, large walls around cities)
	 - Conflict over land

### Religion
 - Constructed from cuneiform documents
 - Mesopotamian religion has oldest literature of any religion
 - Polytheistic: Over 2100 deities (human form)
	 - Deities were feared and had to be obeyed (all-knowing, powerful, immortal)
 - Initially gods were not ordered, eventually came to be ranked (like society)
**Deities**:
 - Lived inside idols in the temples, they were present
 - Gods were taken to hunting parties and other events
 - Served by temple household
 - Dressed and served banquets twice a day, provided with animal sacrifices, incense, privacy in eating
 - King's authority legitimated by ritual role
	 - Mediated between deities and people

### End of Uruk
 - Many large cities across southern plain and increasingly in northern Mesopotamia
 - Mesopotamia shared a common culture and religion, each city was independent
 - Some suggest Uruk ended because of abrupt cold and wet period that disrupted agricultural production
	 - Alternatively, arrival of East Semitic tribes
