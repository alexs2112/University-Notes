### Southern Area: Nazca (200 BCE-700 CE)
 - Same time as the Moche
 - South coast river valleys have smaller drainages and smaller populations
	 - Early villages in oases and areas with surface runoff for irrigation
 - By 500 CE: Tapped aquifers, dug tunnels to irrigate farmlands with spiral shaped tunnels from surface (puquios)
	 - Supported large population densities
**Cahuachi**: (0-500 CE)
 - Largest ritual center
 - Important shrine with 20m high stepped pyramid
 - Rituals focused on rain, water, fertility
**Pottery**:
 - Polychrome decoration
 - Style develops out of earlier Paracas art style
 - Most pots from looted cemeteries at Cahuachi
 - Pots show masked ritual performances of priests
**Nazca Lines**:
 - Geoglyphs: Designs of animals, birds, spiders, etc. along with geometric shapes
 - Created by over-turning dark stones from desert floor to expose underlying pink sand
 - Recent studies show that some lines run for 20km in straight lines
	 - Possibly pathways to areas of water
 - Lines radiate from high points, mountains, wells
 - May also have been used in rainmaking rituals
 - Lines are the same as designs found on pots and textiles
 - Lines are not oriented to astronomical observations
 - Recent studies show sacred landscape with lines walked and offerings made at locations along the lines (for water rites, fertility)
 - Not permanent ritual paths
	 - Sometimes new paths created on top of older lines

### Middle Horizon: First Highland States
 - Tiwanaku and Wari
	 - Same time as Moche
 - Peak in Middle Horizon (600-1000 CE) as Moche declines in the north

### Tiwanaku (500-1000 CE)
 - Founded on Altiplano near Lake Titicaca, good for camelid herding
 - 400 CE: Was a true city (25-40k people)
 - 600 CE: Trading with southern coast by llama caravan
 - 650 CE: Built major shrine on the Island of the Sun
 - Extensive trade in textiles, copper, objects, pottery, wooden objects, gold 
	 - Coastal trade by llama caravans
	 - Trade with southern coast for shell and fish
	 - Trade with tropical forest to the east for birds and medicines
 - Established colonies along trade routes and by military conquest
**Tiwanaku Sukacollas**:
 - Crops grown in raised fields in lakeside marshes and along canals (sukacollas)
 - Raised fields constructed with layers of stone cobbles, covered with clay, then 3 sheets of gravel and topsoil
	 - Prevented potatoes from freezing and becoming waterlogged
 - Low areas between raised areas fills with lake water
 - Highly productive (400% more potatoes than from plots on hillsides)
**Ritual**:
 - Tiwanaku was a large rectangular area with monumental construction
	 - 2 ceremonial earth platforms
	 - Covered 50 acres, aligned with cardinal directions
 - Public performance in these structures
	 - Leaders dressed in costumes as deities
	 - Human sacrifice important to their religion
 - Raised platform called Kalasasaya with carved stone "Gateway of the Sun"
	 - Not in its original place, substantial earthquakes have jumbled up the area
	 - Depicts Viracocha: Creator god holding staves that end in snake heads
 - Interior of Puma Punku complex has sunken court with stelae
	 - Probably where Gateway of the Sun came from originally
 - Complex directs rain runoff into a surrounding moat so platform becomes an island

### Wari Empire
 - 500-850 CE
 - Tiwanaku's rival
	 - Similar imagery to Tiwanaku: Staff gods, felines, eagles, serpents
	 - Relationship between Tiwanaku and Wari is unclear
 - Centered around Ayacucho
	 - Controlled northern highlands
	 - Highly stratified society, elite controlled irrigation system
 - Wari connected its empire with a system of roads
 - Expanded by moving its own people into river valleys
	 - Then set up field terraces, irrigation canals under administrative centers governed by nobles
 - Expert traders between coast and Amazon Basin
**El Castillo de Huarmey**:
 - Unlooted royal Wari tomb reported in 2013
 - 60 individuals buried seated in rows with tombs of 3 Wari queens (mummified)
 - Sophisticated gold and silver jewelry, bronze axes and tools
 - Mummies may have been displayed
**Wari and Tiwanaku**:
 - Collapse: ~1000 CE
 - Why these 2 empires collapsed is unclear
	 - Probably large scale drought; internal warfare
 - Broad geographic influence and trade organization influences the Inka
 - Both are important because they represent small regional states being integrated into larger ones

# Late Intermediate: 1000 - 1400 CE
### Sican
 - 700-1375 CE
 - Develops in Lambeyeque Valley after Moche declines
 - Sican culture had most extensive irrigation networks in South America
	 - Advanced metallurgy
	 - Traded for copper and other metals along Ecuadorian coast
 - Crab masks for Sican lord/deity
 - Rich burials for the rulers with human sacrifices
	 - One grave had 1.2 tons of grave goods, including metals
 - Overthrown by the Chimu state in 1375

### Chimu/Chimor
 - 1100-1400 CE
 - Chimor also rises with collapse of Moche
 - Moche River Valley
	 - Expanded irrigation in the valley
	 - Constructed terraces, large storage reservoirs
	 - One canal between river valleys was 65 km long
 - Greatly increased productivity
**Chimor Farming**:
 - Controlled 12 river valleys (from Lima to Ecuador) until it was conquered by Inka in 1476
 - Controlled 1000 km of coastline, 2/3 of irrigated land in north coast
	 - Northern coast under one state for the first time
**Chimor Roadways and Conquest**:
 - Created a network of roads to move troops to conquer other valleys
 - Chimor broke power of conquered groups by resettling them in other parts of the state
 - Practice later adopted by the Inka
 - Chimor conquered by the Inka (1462-1470)
**Chan Chan**:
 - City center with 10 walled compounds of buildings
	 - Buildings made of adobe brick surrounded by a wall 10m high
	 - Functioned as individual palaces of 10 successive rulers
		 - Served as burial place for ruler in death
 - 300+ female human sacrifices with each ruler
 - Complexes called ciudadelas
**Split Inheritance**:
 - Title passes from father to son, but not his wealth or land
	 - Dead ruler took his wealth into afterlife
	 - Some wealth given to junior kinsmen who maintained his mausoleum
 - Each new ruler inherited large labour force
 - Had to build his own ciudadela and create his own wealth through farming and conquest
**Last Chimor Rulers**:
 - Each valley under a local authority who was responsible to the king
	 - Highly stratified society
	 - Eg. Preparer of the Way: Threw crushed spondyllus shell dust wherever ruler walked
 - Form of healthcare: Herbalists paid by the state to look after the sick
**Chimor End**:
 - Conquered by the Inka in 1470
