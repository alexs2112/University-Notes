# Introduction
**Archaeological Study of Civilizations**
 - First Archaeological Research: **Nabonidus**, last king of Babylon, excavated Temple of Ur in Mesopotamia
 - Italian Renaissance: Growing merchant class interested in Rome, encouraged antiquarianism
	 - Antiquarianism: Collection of antiquities just for the sake of it
		 - Lord Elgins marbles (from Parthenon)
		 - Foundation of European national museums
 - Ciriaco de Pizzicolli (Cyriacus of Ancona): First systematic research that was published
 - Grand Tour: Wealthy Europeans went on grand tour of ancient monuments, looted sites
**States**:
 - Government has full authority, backed by force, economic specialization, social inequality
 - Urban living (densely packed populations) with centralized government
 - States emerge with the origins of agriculture and large scale food production
### Theories for Rise and Fall of Civilizations
**V. Gordon Childe: Urban Revolution**:
 - Characterized by invention of metallurgy, economic specialization of workforce, invention of techs
 - Problems: Craft specialization a result rather than cause of states
	 - Production of surplus does not tell us why it developed in the first place, or why cities started
**Irrigation Theories**:
 - Floodplains in Nile and Euphrates was primary cause for rise of states due to surplus
 - Hydraulic State Theory: Karl Wittfogel, Irrigation leads to central authority
	 - Life in dry river valleys require development of group to organize irrigation + surplus
	 - Authority eventually controls everything else and becomes corrupt
 - Current thoughts: Important to many state structures, took centuries before rulers took over
**Technology and Trade**:
 - Trade for raw materials + other goods stimulated long distance exchange
 - Emergent elite accumulate exotic materials, unequal wealth, prestige goods economy
 - Evidence of chiefdoms in exchange of prestige goods to create regional influence (interaction spheres)
**Warfare: Carneiro's Environmental Circumscription Model**:
 - Farmland bordered by non-arable lands is circumscribed (limited)
 - Population increases, pressures food, one group starts conquering until they lead, people can't leave
 - Problems: Not all states emerge in circumscribed environments, unclear warfare is cause of states
### Gobelki Tepe
 - Worlds oldest megaliths, constructed pre-pottery neolithic period
 - One of the first archaeological evidence of permanent human settlement
**Site Layout**:
 - On flat limestone plateau over Harran plain, good visibility in all directions, access to raw materials
 - Main feature are T-shaped 7-10 ton monolithic pillars from local limestone quarries
	 - Carved with animal reliefs of local animals, some headless humanoid figures
 - Four circular compounds excavated to date, 16 additional have been indicated
	 - After abandonment, each circular enclosure was backfilled with refuse, preserves carved megaliths
**Daily Life**:
 - No agriculture, inhabitants were hunter-gatherers
 - Thousands of stone grinding tools, intensive processing of wild grains for porridge and beer
**Site Function**:
 - Worlds first temple, central location for cult of the dead, human skulls have deep grooves (skull cult)
 - Ritual and feasting when game availability was at its peak
 - Both ritual and profane functions coexisted at the site

# Mesopotamia
### Intro
 - Alluvial plain between Tigris and Euphrates rivers  (land between the two rivers)
 - Northern Plain: Foothills, enough rain in winter to grow crops w/out irrigation (dry farming)
 - Southern Plain: Flat alluvial plain, requires irrigation (little rain)
 - **Before City States**:
	 - Hydraulic state model: Organization of irrigation led to voluntary city states, authority control water
	 - Early settlements: Supported hunter-gatherers, farmers settle along rivers, pottery + copper
 - **Phases of Development**: Halaf, Hassuna, Samarra, Ubaid (shift from mud-houses to irrigation and trade)
	 - Halafian: Rain-fed farming, developed from indigenous groups in the region
	 - Hassuna: First farmers, moved from mountains into foothills, eventual river valleys with irrigation
	 - Samarra: Chalcolithic (copper), *Chogo Mami* has earliest evidence of irrigation, uniform pottery
		 - *Tell es-Sawwan*: Multi roomed mud-brick buildings with walls, T-shaped buildings, grain/burial
	 - Ubaid: Foundation for Mesopotamian civs, farmers settle south and establish villages, temples
**Summary**:
 - **Ubaid**:
	 - Foundation of Mesopotamian society
	 - Temple institution
	 - Irrigation agriculture
 - **Uruk**:
	 - First cities and monumental architecture
	 - Centralized religious and secular rulers
	 - Social hierarchy
	 - Writing
	 - Expansion of trade and wealth with craft specialists
 - **Early Dynastic**:
	 - Writing used for literature
	 - Spread of Sumerian culture under ruling dynasties (shift among city states)
	 - Extreme differences in wealth and status in society (burials at Ur)
 - **Akkadian Empire & Imperial Ur**:
	 - Single ruler of city states in Sumer and Akkad, areas conquered
	 - Rulers claim divinity backed by propaganda
	 - Development o flaw codes to control empire
	 - Fragile political units
**Ubaid**:
 - Initial phase 0, overlaps with Samarra, discovered after phases were established (originally started at 1)
 - Earliest known village in southern plain is *Oueili*, relied on irrigation
 - **Eridu**: Sumerian creation story, first settlement to rise from primordial sea, rapid urbanization
	 - Unwalled settlements, Ubaid culture spreads rapidly from Eridu
	 - Early forms of mud-brick temple structures (built in phases of increasing size and complexity)
 - Temples and religion were focus of Ubaid society, housed gods + religious authority, organized irrigation and trade, large land-holders and employers
	 - Produced and received surplus to obtain luxury status items
 - Most settlements were self-sufficient, some groups had more wealth but not lavish
	 - Mild difference in status between temple and common people emerging
### Mesopotamia - Uruk Period:
 - Uruk Revolution: First urban centers, writing, wheeled vehicles, specialization, centralized religion
 - **Uruk** is the worlds first true city (40-80k people), 4-tiered settlement hierarchy
	 - Was developed unplanned, temple/palaces at core surrounded by whitewashed houses
	 - Possibly 2 settlements centered on White Temple and Eanna district
	 - Smaller satellite towns up to 10km away
 - Warfare increased (fortified villages, large walls), conflict over land
**Religion**: Dedicated to main god Anu (sky god)
 - **White Temple**: Limestone + mud-brick, decorated with cone mosaics, earliest evidence of cuneiform
 - **Anu Ziggurat**: Temple construction becomes more monumental, requires centralized authority
	 - Ziggurats possibly represent mountains or stairways for gods to travel between heaven + earth
 - **Secular Rulers**: Clear evidence of government organization with secular rulers
	 - Most imagery is of men, ruled by charismatic power or military prowess
	 - Provide offerings to gods, god-world mirrored real world, patron god defended city
 - Deities dwelled in wood+gold idols, carried through communities for festivities, taken to hunting parties
	 - Priests: Divine future via dreams, entrails of sacrificed animals, could usurp power of secular rulers
 - Temples and palaces built on top of high mud-brick platforms, spatial separation of temple and palace
**Economy**: City and satellites linked together in network of interdependence
 - Long distance exchange marks increasing complexity (increasing craft specialization)
 - Copper tools for agriculture and warfare
 - Potter's slow wheel to increase volume of pottery, bevel-rimmed bowls to feed labourers
 - Cylinder Seals: Pressed into clay lumps, used as witness to trade, loss had to be announced to prevent debt of thieves
 - Developed Sexagesimal system based on 60
**Writing**:  Tool for bureaucracy, documentation of events and transactions, promotes efficient trade
 - Stage 1: Notation systems in Neolithic, baked clay tokens in 16 shapes by commodity, size by quantity
	 - Eventually explodes to 300 forms with markings for more detailed records
 - Stage 2: Many tokens encased in clay bullae (balls), bullae impressed w/ outline of tokens before sealed
	 - Probably represent a single transaction
 - Stage 3: Shift to tablets, 80% of Uruk tablets were economic in nature, early inscriptions in shape of tokens, later signs were syllabic, gradually replaced by cuneiform
 - Cuneiform: Wedge-shaped tool to make symbols (stylus), left-to right, signs turned 90 degrees
	 - Most people were illiterate, scribes usually men (plus Enheduanna, daughter of King Sargon)
	 - Highly efficient form of standardized record keeping, used to write different languages
**End of Uruk**: Possibly abrupt cold and wet period disrupting farming, possible arrival of east semitic tribes
### Mesopotamia - Sumerian Early Dynastic
 - Beginning of historical period, southern plain divided into Sumer (south), Akkad (north)
 - Cosmopolitan population, major group was Sumerians, all groups had common language, writing, gods
 - **Control of Nippur**: Most important religious center in Mesopotamia, essential for political control
	 - Home of the god Enlil (god of gods), god-world mirrors living world
 - **Sumerian City States**: Brick walls, central temple, palace architecture, often faced onto rivers
**Sumer**: Ur was a city state, importance shift from Uruk to Ur
 - Link to other polities via trade, expands w/ increased demand for luxury goods, expands maritime trade
**Technology and Economy**: Agriculture was biggest, settlements on river had grain parching & storage
 - Settlements founded intentionally by state as part of organized control of grain supply
 - Textiles was second industry, images of women weaving fabrics and carpets
 - Pottery trade declines (possibly due to metal and stone vessels)
**Bronze Age**: Introduced in this period, improved agriculture and warfare,
**Sumerian Texts**: Cuneiform texts in Sumerian, later Akkadian
 - King-list of ruling cities and kings, divided into 2 broad periods (before and after great flood)
 - **Utnapishtim and Great Flood**: Gods of Shuruppak decided to get rid of people, Utnapishtim warned by god Ea, built ark for himself, family, animals.
	 - Other gods first angry then relieved that humanity and animals survived, granted immortality
	 - Gods restored kingship and civilization with dynasty at Kish (king Enmegaragesi)
 - **Epic of Gilgamesh**: Historic king of Uruk, part god, part human
	 - Exploited people building great city and its walls, people appealed for help from sky god Anu
		 - Anu creates wild man Enkidu who goes to Uruk to meet Gilgamesh, become friends after fight
	 - Gilgamesh rejects advances of goddess Innana, kills Enkidu, Gilgamesh realizes own mortality
		 - Sets out to find immortality, goes to Utnapishtim, fails every test, accepts mortal life
**Cemetery of City of Ur**: Just outside sacred precinct of Ur, 2500+ burials
 - 16 graves are royal w/ lavish grave goods, brick/stone chambers, human sacrifices, prestige objects
	 - Clear and extreme differences in wealth/status in burials between people and elite
 - **Royal Burial: Prince Meskalamdug**:  Tomb with gold objects,  name on objects w/ title of king, gold helmet and sheet metal mask, musical instruments, models of boats, games
 - **Queen Puabi**: Stone chamber at bottom of deep shaft, Puabi on wooden bier with cloak, wig, gold, attendants. Surrounded by death pit of men, female attendants, oxen, grooms (59 human sacrifices)
	 - Beneath her tomb is that of a man (husband?) with more sacrifices
 - Written records show Sumerians believed afterlife is unpleasant, no food or comforts, needed to bring items to gift to lords of underworld to improve situation
### Mesopotamia - Akkadian Empire
 - Consolidation of city states into the first true empire
 - Development of public propaganda in monuments
 - Kingship previously shifted among city-states/dynasties, **Sargon**: "Legitimate Ruler"
**Sargon**: Legend secret son of priestess in temple of Ishtar, set adrift in reed basket on Euphrates
 - Found, raised at court, became ruler of his people (Moses in Old Testament)
 - Conquers king of Uruk, becomes ruler of Akkad and Sumer, builds empire by attacking neighbours
	 - Brilliant warrior (daughter was writer Enheduanna)
 - Peak expansion under grandson Naram-Sin (his actual son was assassinated)
 - **Naram-Sin of Akkad**: Declares himself divine, undermines competing authority of the temple
	 - Ruler now spiritual & secular, new rulers intensify irrigation to increase wealth (unsustainable)
**Imperial Ur**: Established by Ur-Nammu who founds 3rd dynasty of Ur, defeat of Akkadians by Sumerians
 - Ur was a very important port, extended influence via diplomacy + religion rather than warfare
 - **Ur-Nammu** (Shulgi's Law Code): Divides society into 2 groups (free + slaves), written in 1st person king
	 - Voice of justice to all, monetary fines for bodily injury, capital punishment for big crimes
 - **Code of Hammurabi**: Law code very similar to Ur, more detailed and complex
 - Society based on law codes, social hierarchy, labour sometimes enforced (or voluntary for rations)
	 - Slaves were large part of labour force, could own property and buy freedom from owners
**King Shulgi**: Son Shulgi made Ur capital of extensive empire, standardized administration with governers, regularizing tax, tribute paymets
	Built great ziggurat at Ur (Sumerian style), patronized artists who wrote of his prowess in war & hunting
	Weak kings after Shulgi, empire declines

# Ancient Egypt
### Intro
 - Developed on the Nile river floodplain, largest river in the world, annual floods provided rich alluvium
 - First state of its size in history, territorial state, long and narrow oasis surrounded by desert
 - Called their land "Kemet" (Black Land, fertile soils of floodplain) vs "Deshret" (Red land, dry desert sands)
 - Divided into Lower Egypt (Nile river delta, ta-mehu, land of papyrus) and Upper Egypt (south of delta, ta-shema, land of shema reed)
 - Unification of Upper (white domed crown, hedjet) and Lower (red curled crown, deshret) Egypt represented in combined crowns (sekhemti)
**Timeline**:
 - Neolithic/Chalcolithic or Pre-dynastic Period (5000-3100 BCE)
 - Archaic or Early Dynastic Period (3100-2700 BCE)
 - Dynastic Period (2700-1070 BCE)
	 - Old Kingdom (2700-2140 BCE)
	 - First Intermediate (2140-2040 BCE)
	 - Middle Kingdom (2040-1640 BCE)
	 - Second Intermediate (1640-1550 BCE)
	 - New Kingdom (1550-1070 BCE)
	 - Third Intermediate/Decline (1100 BCE)
 - **Kingdoms**: State is under a centralized authority (king or pharaoh) ruling from a capital city
 - **Intermediates**: Periods where power became decentralized, held by local authorities (nomarchs)
### Pre-Dynastic
 - Neolithic/Chalcolithic, farming based on cattle and cereal farming on Nile floodplain
	 - Planted crops or grazed animals as the flood receded, harvested before next flood
**Lower Egypt**: Social differences in burials, large towns had own gods and local rulers
 - *Maadian Culture*: Traded with Upper Egypt, Levant, Mesopotamia, undecorated pottery
**Upper Egypt**: Earliest farming society is Badarian culture, produced fine black-topped red ware pottery
 - Earliest direct evidence of embalming, antibacterial recipes similar to those used 2500 years later
 - **Egyptian Faience**: Crushed quartz mixed with various minerals to produce blue, green, or turquoise
	 - Paste was shaped in molds, fired in a kiln, calcium silicates produced a glass surface
	 - Objects also dipped in powder or painted with the paste
	 - Believed the reflection of light off these pieces was the light of immortality
 - **Bearded Men**: New form of sculpture, beard as symbol of power, precursor for pharaohs false beards
**Urbanism in Upper Egypt**: 3 important cities: Naqada, Nekhen (Hierakonpolis), This/Thinis (Abydos)
 - Developed irrigation to increase food production, social inequality in burials, material culture of UE in LE
 - **Nekhen**: City of the Falcon Diety, very prosperous center, large beer-brewing and pottery installations
	 - Cradle of Egyptian kingship, Falcon deity is early form of Horus, temple of mud-plastered oval surrounded by reed fence and filled with rectangular buildings (earliest temple in Egypt)
	 - Over 150 working-class graves with early mummification in fetal position
	 - Elite burials with rich grave goods and some clay masks, ivory figurines with similar masks (ruler?)
	 - **Earliest Zoo**: Edge of elite cemetery, tombs of exotic animals buried whole, sacrificed wild animals
	 - **Elite Tomb 100**: New cemetery, first mud-brick sepulcher w/ painted walls, procession of ruler on barque carrying him to the afterlife surrounded by dangerous forces
### Proto-Dynastic
 - Named kings emerge as heads of states in Upper Egypt, leading to unification
**Scorpion Dynasty 0**: Mace head from cemetery at Nekhen, king wearing white domes crown of UE
 - Many other symbols of authority, regalia of later dynastic kingship
 - **This/Thynis (Abydos)**: King Scorpion?, brick lined tomb as house for the king, scorpion inked on jars
	 - Earliest hieroglyphic writing, already a well-developed system
**King Narmer (Menes)**: Many competing kings in UE leading to unification
 - Narmer Palette found at Nekhen, commemorates unification of Egypt by King Narmer of This
 - Shown wearing combined crown of Upper and Lower Egypt
### Early Dynastic
 - Archaic period, major elements of dynastic kingship become well-developed
 - **Role of King**: Responsible for mediating between Order (Ma'at) and Chaos (Isfet)
	 - Creator god Ra instituted Ma'at, king was manifestation of Ra, returned after death
 - Kings buried in *mastabas* (low mud-brick structures), burial chamber beneath entered by staircase
	 - Abydos is sacred burial place of Dynastic kings
 - Human sacrifices intended to serve king in afterlife, replaced by Shabtis (figures who come to life)
 - Kings created cult centers to the gods to link themselves to all local deities, forged national religion
	 - King identified with Horus and sun god Ra
	 - Ra sailed across sky during the day in day-barque, boarded night-barque at sunset to fight chaos
 - **Afterlife**: *Ba* is person's spirit, leaves body, needs to return. *Ka* is life force that needs to be nourished
 - Mummification increasingly refined, removed organs, dried body and perfumed, took up to 70 days
 - **Pyramid Texts and Book of the Dead**: Book based on pyramid texts, spells that aid dead in underworld
 - **Political Organization**: Territorial state with many cities under centralized authority
	 - State divided into nomes (provinces), governed by nomarchs appointed by king
 - **Memphis**: Capital set up by Early Dynastic kings, king and vizier lived here (border between UE & LE)
	 - King ruled by his word and through Goddess Maat, no written law code
 - Bureaucracy run by Followers of Horus, administered King storehouses, household, and state
 - 2 Egyptian scripts: Hieroglyphics for monuments & funerals, and Hieratic/Demotic (everyday)
### Old Kingdom
 - Third dynasty kings ruled as sons of Ra-Horakhty (combination of Ra and Horus)
	 - Kingship legitimated that well-being of people relied on divine pharaoh to talk to the gods
	 - Powerful priesthood emerges around cult to sun god Ra, after death king is assimilated with Ra
 - Program of monumental building began, royal tombs shift from mastabas to pyramids
**Pyramid Building**:
 - **Saqqara**: First pyramid, west-bank of the Nile, surrounded by stone wall enclosure with temples
	 - Constructed by King Djoser under vizier Imhotep, first major stone building in antiquity
 - **Smooth Sided True Pyramids**: Sneferu (Snofru) built first true pyramid, took 3 tries
	 - One was stepped, one was bent, finally Red Pyramid was perfect 43 degrees
	 - Represented rays of the sun, symbolized mound Ra stood on at time of creation
 - **Giza Plateaus**: Khufu builds Great Pyramid on Giza Plateau, smooth sided pyramids
	 - Khafre builds middle pyramid, Sphinx guarding his mortuary temple
	 - Menkaure builds last and smallest pyramid using red granite (quality over quantity?)
 - Long-term projects integrated people into state, dependent on work, worker community with bakeries to feed labourers (ration of bread, onions, beer)
### First Intermediate
 - Centralized authority broke down, power shifted to local nomarchs (weak rulers and/or drought)
 - Period of social reorganization, some warfare
 - Previously, only king and elite could afford the afterlife, as more people were now wealthy they began to demand privileges that the Old Kingdom reserved for the elite
 - Nature of Egyptian society was sustained (religion, hierarchy), not a breakdown of society
### Middle Kingdom
 - Mentuhotep II from UE reunites Egypt, moves capital to Thebes, "Classical Age"
 - Greatest literature and art from this period, peaceful period of monumental building, irrigation
 - Shift in cult of sun god from Ra to Amun-Ra (southern counterpart + Ra), king as shepherd of people
 - **Cult of Osiris from Abydos**: Osiris is god and judge of dead, pharaoh assimilated after death
	 - Anyone can enter afterlife if they can account for deeds on earth, metaphor for life + resurrection
	 - Mass consumption and national adoption of elite culture, mass production of funerary objects
 - **Story of Osiris**: Osiris leaves Egypt, brother Seth builds coffin and tricks him inside
	 - Throws him into Nile, floats to Lebanon, cuts body up and throws bits around Egypt
	 - Isis finds everything except Osiris phallus, makes false one, conceives Horus, avenges by killing Seth
	 - Metaphor of the Nile, Osiris is Nile, Seth is hot desert wind, Isis is the earth
### Second Intermediate
 - **Hyksos**: Not clear why MK declines, marked by rise of Hyksos in LE
	 - End of MK has large number of Asiatics in Egypt (cooks, brewers, artisans, winemakers from Syria)
 - **Hyksos Pharaohs**: Gain political control of LE with capital at Avaris
	 - Friezes painted by Minoan artists of bull-leaping scenes in palace, potential marriage agreements
	 - Respected Egyptian traditions, took on titles, traditions, religious beliefs of pharaohs
 - Brought innovation to Egypt (bronze, weaponry, horse war chariot) and drew into global economy
