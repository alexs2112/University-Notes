### Harappan Civilization
 - 3300-1300 BCE
 - Harappa is a Bronze Age civilization
 - Develops in 3 phases:
	 - Early Harappan (3300-2600 BCE): Populations increase
	 - Mature Harappan (2600-1900 BCE): Populations at peak
	 - Late Harappan (1900-1300 BCE): Populations decline

### Early Harappan (3300-2600 BCE)
 - 5500-3300 BCE: Pre-Harappan sites are established on floodplain
 - Potter's wheel used in sites by 3500 BCE
 - Population increased
	 - Settlements on floodplain were mainly villages and towns
	 - Number of substantial cities were emerging
 - Many of these settlements were intentionally burned as the large cities formed (2600 BCE)
	 - Possibly over competition for land
 - Larger settlements have fired-brick walls around the settlement to protect from flooding

### Mature Harappan (2600-1900 BCE)
 - Indus civilization lasts only a few centuries
 - Rise of cities in the Indus valley is thought to be sudden
 - Possibly brought about by trade or warfare
	 - No evidence of armies
 - Wheeled carts were important in trade
	 - Independently invented about the time of the rise of urban centers
 - Sumerians dramatically increased trade with the Indus Valley in this period
	 - Previously: Sumerians traded for exotics across the Iranian plateau by foot
	 - 2600 BCE: Sumerians began to trade by boat via Dilmun and Magan (Persian Gulf) and Meluhha (oils, furniture, gold, carnelian) (Indus Valley)
**Meluhhans**:
 - King Sargon (2350 BCE, Akkadian) stated that Meluhhan ships were moored in his capital
 - There is also evidence of Meluhhan villages located in Mesopotamia near Ur
 - Trade would involve specialized merchants
	 - Clay seals, carnelian beads from Indus craftsment are found in Mesopotamian royal burials
	 - Gold, carnelian, ivory, oils, lapis lazuli, copper, silver from Indus Valley, traded for cereals, leather, wool from Mesopotamia
 - Harappans also increased overland trade routes to the Iranian plateau
	 - Trade coincides with the first cities in Indus Valley
**Local Trade**:
 - When large cities emerged, relied on exchanging crops from different areas.
	 - This broke down over time to a reliance on local crops
 - Initial regional trade redistributed resources from a large area
	 - Buffer against poor years in some areas
**Harappan Cities**:
 - 1000 communities in 1.3 million km2, population of about 1 million (others say 5 million)
	 - Only about 5% has been excavated
 - Political organization is believed to have been divided between many small and medium sized cities that were dominated by the large cities of Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Rakhigarhi
	 - Sarasvati river valley was dominated by Ganeriwala
	 - Gujarat was dominated by Dholavira and Saurashtra
**New Political and Social Order**:
 - Harappan cities do not fit theoretical models
	 - New cities had no temples nor palaces
 - Harappa and Mohenjo-daro were occupied by an unpretentious middle class of merchants and officials
	 - No monuments to the elite, no elite burials, no propaganda
	 - Emphasis on modesty, order, cleanliness
 - Unknown if settlements were independent city states or if this was a territorial state

### Mohenjo-daro
 - Largest of the Mature Harappan cities
	 - 40-80k people
 - The builders followed a grid-like plan that suggest considerable municipal supervision
 - The high citadel (12m) in the west end was protected by burnt-brick fortification with towers
	 - Great Bath (900 cubic meters), predates the Romans by several thousand years
 **Standardized Bricks**:
  - Sun-dried and fired brick used for construction
  - Fired brick impermeable to water
	  - Used for drains, pools, walls around cities and important buildings
  - Standardized size (7x14x28 cm, 1:2:4) used in multiple cities suggesting some kind of shared bureaucracy
  - Required considerable organization to produce on massive scale and to build fired brick structures
**City Planning**:
 - Planned streets and alleys
 - Major roads were 9m wide, cross-streets were half that wide and unpaved
 - Houses were built in 4 designs of mud-brick, were 2-3 stories tall
**Wealthier Houses**:
 - Wealthier homes (merchants, officials) had a central courtyard for receiving guests, food prep
 - Wealthier homes had bathing areas and toilets connected to sewer system
	 - Also public baths and toilets
 - Larger underground drains carefully lined with fired bricks removed waste
	 - Water management system with reservoirs
**Poorer Houses**:
 - Outskirts of the city
 - Simpler, single-room tenements or workshops
 - Occupants would be labourers, although it has been suggested that they could be religious ascetics
**Public Buildings on the Citadel**:
 - Pillared hall (27 square meteres), possibly precinct for audiences with potential rulers
	 - But no evidence for a governing structure
 - No shrines
 - Religious life around bath
	 - Bitumen sealed bricks fed by well
	 - Pool surrounded by colonnade with steps at both ends
	 - Possibly for ritual bathing (important in later Indian religions) or a public bath
 - Large 10 square meter building east of Great Bath with no well
	 - Possibly college for priests
 - Set of granaries/great hall

### Harappa
 - Quite similar layout to Mohenjo-daro, not identical plan
 - Instead, a cluster of walled mounds with loosely built-up areas
 - Also has a citadel and lower town in the grid pattern
 - Other cities (Dholavira) had different plans
	 - Suggests the city-plan varied

### Lothal
 - A port built in the Gulf of Khambhat
	 - First artificial dockyard
 - The port was built at the highest level of the tide, ships are then moved by tides in the river estuary
 - Wooden door (lock) was put at the mouth of the port to hold enough water to keep boats afloat in the harbour at low tide
 - Used burnt brick construction for walls of the harbour

### Political Organization
 - The structure of the state is unknown
 - Considerable evidence of some kind of authority present:
	 - Large cities, citadels, walls, planning, sanitation systems
	 - Standardized weights and measures, writing, bricks
	 - Harbour for extensive long-distance exchange
 - All required considerable municipal and extra-municipal management
 - Evidence that the population was made of diverse ethnic groups, languages who shared a cultural style
 - Some theorize that leaders of early communities may have been chieftains, priests, or kin leaders
	 - Intermediaries between deities and people
 - Possibly classes and centers formed a decentralized structure
**Possible Rulers**:
 - Rulers are anonymous (no palaces, no inscriptions, no propaganda)
 - Only exception is a limestone figure from Mohenjo-daro
	 - Bearded man, possibly meditating, wearing embroidered robe
	 - Uncovered shoulder is a sign of reverence during Buddha's lifetime 1400 years ago
 - Only archaeological evidence is possibly merchants/religious leaders with no lavish displays
 - Not clear if these were city states or territorial states

### Harappan Civilization
 - Focus of the society was agriculture and trade
 - Irrigation allowed large agriculture surplus
 - Possibly farmers turned over a large portion of crops to the the authority (whatever it is) for construction in the city, maintaining sewers, bricks for buildings, trade infrastructure
	 - This is controversial
**Burials**:
 - Recent excavation of about 200 burials in Harappa at foot of 2 main city mounds
 - No elite burials, oval/rectangular pits sometimes lined with mud bricks
	 - Sometimes body placed in a wooden coffin in an extended position, head north and feet south
 - Burials have very few goods placed with them, only ordinary jewelry and a few pots
	 - Exception of one man with a gold necklace
	 - Some women have a copper mirror, possibly to see into spirit world
 - Strontium isotope analysis of the teeth of 40 individuals indicates that half were immigrants to the city
	 - An element present in drinking water from different locations that gets trapped in teeth
		 - Can tell where they have been based on the water they have consumed
	 - Indicates the draw of the city from different parts of the region
 - Strong bond held these cities together
**Writing**:
 - Harappan script remains undeciphered
 - Various theories that the language represents ancient Dravidian, but Indian scholars argue it is early Sanskrit
 - 400-450 pictographs (possibly more)
 - Computer analysis indicates symbols are sounds and words (logosyllabic)
 - Symbols deciphered are people's names and rank
	 - Some are a measuring system
	 - Possibly document trade accounts
 - Read right to left (boustrophedon style)
 - Date to 2800 BCE, most from mature Harappan (2500-2050 BCE)
**Seals**:
 - Carved in soft soapstone
 - Depict people, animals
	 - May have been religious symbols or tags for goods sent in trade
 - Possible that daily writing was on ola leaves (type of palm), used until recent times
 - Leaves were soaked and pounded
	 - Provide smooth surface for daily writing by scratching on surface, then wiping with ink-covered cloth
 - Unclear if writing for economic or religious reasons
**Technology and Trade**:
 - Cities and other walled settlements were the setting for craft production
 - Craftworkers were settled in separate parts of the cities
 - Bead makers, copper workers, weavers, potters, stamp steal makers
 - Metalworkers cast objects using the lost wax technique
**Craft Materials**:
 - Local materials (clay) with potters' workshops
	 - Also precious stones and metal through long-distance exchange
 - Uniform style of the Indus Valley is thought to have developed not through centralized control but through intensive exchange over the lowlands
 - Beads made of carnelian, faience, precious metals and stones
**Economy**:
 - System of standardized weights and measures
	 - Includes the 1/2 oz. weight
		 - Common in the region until the 19th century CE
	 - Suggests tight control of trade and exchange
	 - Found as far as the Persian Gulf
 - Most stone weights in Mohenjo-Daro made of chert and organized into a series
	 - Smaller ones in jewelers' shops
 - Seals, weights, writing, long-distance exchange
	 - Suggests economic bureaucracy
**Toys? And Games!**:
 - Elaborate pottery wheeled cart with oxen, a toy?
 - Many other types of toys
	 - Cattle with a string to make head move
	 - Monkeys that go up a stick
 - Dice invented in Harappa, spread with trade
 - Early version of chess or parcheesi
**Religious Beliefs**:
 - May have begun with beliefs in the fertility goddess
	 - One female deity with conspicuous breasts and sexual organs
 - Seal from Mohenjo-Daro shows a three-headed figure in a yogic position wearing a horned headdress surrounded by wild animals
 - Possibly forerunner to Hindu god Shiva: Role as Lord of the Beasts
**Early Hinduism**:
 - Many seals depict cattle that may be symbols of Shiva
 - Possible connections to Hinduism
 - Other elements include:
	 - Fire altars in homes
	 - Worship with fruit and flowers
	 - Meditation and astronomical knowledge
	 - Importance of water and bathing

### End of Harappan Civilization
 - Collapse of trade with the Near East after 2300 BCE
 - Urban populations decline and disperse
	 - Indus script stops
 - Demise of Sarasvati river from tectonic change
 - Climatic change to drought conditions in the valley (2100 BCE) would disrupt agriculture
 - Forest clearance for farmland, firing bricks
	 - May have caused large scale soil erosion resulting in uncontrolled flooding
**Collapse or Societal Reorganization?**
 - Cold arid phase persisted till 1500 BCE due to weakened summer monsoons
 - By 1700 BCE, cities like Mohenjo-Daro were in decline and then abandoned
 - After 1500 BCE, post-Indus phase characterized by increase in numbers of settlements on the margins of the Indus Zone
	 - Populations flourish, may even have grown
 - Indo-Aryan speaking peoples settle in northwest India during this period as well, an event described in the Rigveda
	 - Supported by recent genetic evidence
 - By 1500 BCE, rice cultivation in the Ganges basin in areas unsuitable for wheat and barley
	 - Millet introduced to southern India from Africa
