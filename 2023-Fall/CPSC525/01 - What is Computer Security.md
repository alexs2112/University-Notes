### Security Triad
 - A computing system is "secure" only if it exhibits all three of these properties:
 - **Confidentiality**
	 - Access to systems or data should be limited to "authorized" parties
 - **Integrity**
	 - Data should neither be intentionally tampered with nor accidentally corrupted
 - **Availability**
	 - The system or data should always be there when you need (or want) it
	 - Typically the one to be sacrificed, less catastrophic than the others if it fails
	 - Example: DDOS attacks

### Security vs Reliability
 - Security has a lot to do with reliability
 - A secure system is one that you can rely on to:
	 - Keep your personal data confidential
	 - Allow only authorized access / modifications to resources
	 - Give correct & meaningful results; and
	 - Give correct & meaningful results when you want them

### Security is non-intuitive
 - **Mentality**: Bad guys can be skilled, clever, sneaky, well-equipped, and cunning
	 - Not rational by most definitions
	 - Goal is to wreak havoc and cause intentional failures
 - **Imbalance**: Bad guys only need one way in
	 - Good guys need to defend against all realistic attacks
 - **Unpredictability**: Bad parties win by doing what good guys don't expect
	 - "Anyone can design a system that they themselves cannot break"

### Principle of Easiest Penetration
 - An attacker must be expected to use any available means of penetration
 - Attackers will go after the weakest link, not the most obvious or the most convenient to fortify
 - Must learn how to think like an attacker

### Principle of Adequate Protection
 - *Security âŠ† Economics*: Digital assets should be protected to a degree consistent with their value, and only until they lose their value
 - Spending $100k to protect an asset that can only cause $1k in damages
 - Spending $100k to attack a system that can only yield $1k in rewards
