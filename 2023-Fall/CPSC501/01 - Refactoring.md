### Basic Concepts:
 - **Definition**: Disciplined process of changing the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and maintain, without changing external observable behaviour
 - **Goal**: Improve the design of the code after it is written and working
 - `JUnit` is used in this course to test iterative refactoring steps with unit tests
 - Well-designed software systems decay as they are modified over time, refactoring reverses this decay
	 - Bad design can be radically improved with a series of *small* changes
	 - Refactoring done during maintenance: When fixing bugs or adding new features
 - Works well with iterative development techniques
	 1. Choose part of the system
	 2. Analysis of requirements
	 3. Design
	 4. Coding
	 5. Testing
	 - Refactoring is a form of redesign that can be superimposed on the iterative lifecycle
		 - Can refactor during design, coding, and testing
		 - Refactoring is a cyclical process
