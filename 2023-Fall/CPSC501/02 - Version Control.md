### Basic Concepts
 - **Version control system**:
	 - Stores source code files for a project in a central place
		 - Allows multiple developers to work on the same code base in a controlled way
	 - Keeps a record of changes made to source code files over time
		 - Recall any version of a file based on a date or version number
	 - Allows you to maintain multiple, concurrent releases of your software
		 - ie. the *mainline* (or *trunk*) plus one or more *branch releases*
 - **Repository**: Place where source code files for projects are stored
	 - Will contain *all* versions of the files (stored as differences)
	 - Is usually network accessible
	 - You should also store non-code project artifacts such as:
		 - Makefiles
		 - External documentation (analysis, design, etc)
	 - Best not to store generated artifacts
		 - Object code, executable, javadoc output, etc
 - **Workspace**: The place where you work on a copy of a project's files
	 - Files in the repository are not directly changed, you work on a local copy
 - **Checking Out**: Populates your workspace with up-to-date copies of files and directories from the repository
 - **Committing**: Saves your changes back into the repository
	 - Sometimes called *checking in*
	 - The repository keeps track of changes using revision numbers
		 - You can also comment the change
 - **Updating**: Repopulates your workspace with the latest versions of files
	 - Useful when other developers are also working concurrently on the same project
 - **Version Number**: Each version of a file (or a set of files) is given a unique *revision number*
	 - In SVN (subversion):
		 - 1 for the initial revision
		 - 2, 3, etc. for subsequent committed versions
	 - Is time stamped and can be commented
 - **Tag**: Allows you to name a particular revision of your project (or particular directories or subsets of files)
	 - Eg: `PreRelease1` might tag revision 34 of `file1.c`, revision 27 of `file2.c`, etc
	 - Checking out using the tag retrieves the same set of files despite subsequent revisions
 - You can:
	 - Retrieve a specific revision of a file or set of files (a directory or project)
	 - List the differences between revisions
	 - Retrieve all source code as it appeared at some date in the past
 - Normally, developers work on the same shared code base for a project
	 - Called the *mainline* or *trunk*
